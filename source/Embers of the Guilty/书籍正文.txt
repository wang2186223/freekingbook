###chapter 1 The Darkest Bloody Night

********
When prosecutor-turned-editor Nancy's husband dies in a fire at the city's most exclusive club, the scene is a nightmare: his organs surgically removed, displayed like grotesque art. The prime suspect? Laura, his charismatic college friend who claims innocence with theatrical flair. But Nancy's legal instincts scream conspiracy. Digging into her husband's hidden lies and a web of false witnesses, she uncovers the club's underworld of drugs, sex, and corruption. As she closes in on the truth, one question haunts her: Did she ever truly know the man she loved?
********

[If I say I love you, I'll love your past, your tantrums, even your flaws.]

[If I say I love you, I'll offer my heart, lungs, spleen, and stomach to the love god who's fallen into hell.]

[If I say I love you, I'll drain my blood, leaving only my skin to wrap around your soul, dodging death's grasp.]

[If I say I love you, we'll kiss passionately, our tongues entwined, our bodies merging, burning away sin and sorrow with a fiery embrace.]

[We'll meet eventually.]

Alan had recently gotten hooked on writing novels. This was a short poem he scribbled in his notebook, painting a picture of medieval lovers vowing to stay together forever despite persecution from their religious sect.

Reading it, I frowned. It had a strong narrative, but it also had a bloody and mysterious vibe, which wasn't really his usual style.

Alan Smith was my husband.

To be honest, when I first saw him in college, I thought he was nice. Girls often liked men who reminded them of their fathers. And Alan was indeed an ideal husband-steady, a great cook, and he lived a simple life.

A few years ago, I quit my job at the prosecutor's office, and everyone was against it. But Alan supported me without hesitation, saying not to worry about money. He worked at the Forestry Bureau, and his salary was decent, enough to support us.

Finding something I loved to do was a stroke of luck. And having Alan still be so considerate after ten years of marriage was another blessing.

My name was Nancy Johnson. I was the chief editor of the largest legal publication in the city, Silverlight City Legal Journal, a former prosecutor, and a licensed attorney. I was a typical workaholic, or rather, a strong woman. In just three years after leaving the prosecutor's office, I worked my way up from reporter to chief editor.

I had noticed Alan acting strange lately but couldn't quite put my finger on it. Overall, he seemed more melancholic and indecisive. Every time he looked at me, there was an inexplicable, unreadable emotion in his eyes.

I trusted my judgment. It wasn't just a woman's intuition but the accumulation of years of legal work. He must be hiding something, and he would tell me at some point. This was the trust built over years of marriage.

Thinking of this, I stretched and changed to a more comfortable position, lying horizontally on the sofa. I took out my phone and checked the time. It was already 10 PM, and Alan hadn't come back yet.

He went to a college reunion, which he had informed me about a few days ago.

Although it was a bit late, I decided not to rush him. I closed the Facebook chat page. It had been a while since they last met, and I didn't want to interrupt their conversation. Men needed to maintain their dignity when they were out. They didn't like women who constantly nagged about trivial things and followed them around complaining, and neither did I.

At this moment, a news alert popped up on my phone: [A major fire broke out in a private room at the largest entertainment venue in the city, True Love Entertainment Club, injuring several people. No deaths have been reported so far.]

When reading news about such incidents, people needed to pay attention to the wording. "No deaths have been reported so far" often meant someone was critically injured and near death. The news was phrased this way to maintain social stability, and the club owner likely pulled some strings.

Sure enough, a message from my boss popped up on Facebook: [Check your email.]

I opened my work email to find a dozen photos. Despite my years of experience in legal work, I was still shocked by what I saw.

The hotel room was completely burned, with all the furniture charred. Only the frame of a sofa remained, and on it was a charred body-or rather, a piece of charcoal.

Even more bizarre, the body's chest had been clearly cut open, with all the organs removed, leaving only some charred tissue inside.

Was this revenge? Torture? A crime of passion? Or organ trafficking? 

My mind was racing as I kept scrolling through the photos.

Then I froze.

The heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach, eyes, and male genitalia were hanging from the ceiling of the room.

The ceiling was high, and the fire hadn't reached it. The body parts were cooked by the heat and smoke.

Even more bizarre, a set of blackened metal cutlery and plates were neatly arranged on the floor, along with some other charred items that were unidentifiable.

What did this mean? Were they planning to eat? Or... was it some kind of unspeakable ritual?

Self-media editors would sensationalize this, making wild speculations. I recalled the bizarre cases in Silverlight City over the past decade. As the most developed city in the West, it wouldn't have cult-related cases. It was likely a cover for some other motive.

Based on my years of experience, I concluded that this was not an accidental fire as reported, but clearly a premeditated arson and murder case, and from the photos, it was a well-planned operation.

At this moment, my phone rang. It was my boss.

He said helplessly, "Nancy, you know, I wanted you to take a good vacation, go out for a few days, and have a nice holiday with Alan. I've always cared about your life, after all, you're our only..."

He paused for a moment and then continued, "But you've seen the photos. It's clearly not an accidental fire. It has a cult-like feel, but there haven't been similar cases in Silverlight City for the past decade, so let's rule that out. I suspect it's a premeditated murder case. I suggest analyzing it from the perspective of a psychopathic killer. Also, I think we should withhold some details of the case. Although it will cost us some clicks, legal responsibility outweighs profit."

The boss liked to beat around the bush, but I got straight to the point, "If this incident were to be exposed, it would have a huge impact. It would be a blow to the public's psychological endurance and could even encourage similar crimes. Regarding such information, I always follow the position of official media. This is the duty of a legal professional."

The boss said, "Alright, no problem. Then you need to work overtime tonight. I'll send you the information we have. The official media will likely release the real situation tomorrow afternoon. We'll publish our analysis right after."

"OK," I replied.

As soon as the call ended, a compressed file was sent to my email. I entered the password and opened it. Scrolling quickly, I started to read the information.

The incident occurred around 9 PM. The police were already investigating, and the suspect had been identified and arrested. It was a woman, and a photo was attached.

The suspect's identity wasn't important. The motive and the plan behind the crime were the key points.

Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of that photo, and my heart skipped a beat. The person in the photo looked familiar; I had seen her just a few days ago in a group picture with Alan's college friends.

My fingers felt frozen as I struggled to scroll back. Then Laura Brown's photo appeared before me.

She was at the class reunion tonight. 

Fire, murder, suspect Laura-I felt a chill run through my body as I dialed Alan's number.

Once, twice, three times, no one answered the phone.

I felt as if I had fallen into an icy abyss; my vision darkened, my heart raced, and I couldn't help but tremble slightly. Countless thoughts flashed through my mind.

At this moment, my phone rang. It was an unknown number. I stared at the familiar photo, but I didn't dare to answer the call.

I forced myself to calm down, took a deep breath, and answered the call.

"Hello, is this Mrs. Smith? This is the Silverlight City Police Department's Criminal Investigation Division. We've found a charred body, and preliminary DNA matching indicates it is Alan Smith. Please come to identify the body."

Hearing no response, the police called out, "Mrs. Smith?"

###chapter 2 Autopsy

At 10:30 PM, I grabbed a ride-share and zoomed over to the police station.

I didn't drive myself because I was worried I'd lose it. I needed to stay as level-headed as possible.

The ride took about half an hour. I kept scrolling through the recent chat logs, but nothing seemed off.

Alan: [Nancy, have dinner on your own tonight. I ordered from that place next to our apartment. It should be there around 7 PM.]

Alan: [Nancy, it's been ages since I hung out with my college buddies. I want to catch up with them. Thinking back to college, it's been a wild ride. Meeting you has been the best thing in my life.]

The Facebook chat logs ended there. No more messages.

Neurologically speaking, when confronted with immense suffering, the brain automatically activated a shielding mechanism, rendering emotions numb to prevent the human mind from sustaining damage under extreme stress.

I tried to push the past out of my mind, to not think of myself as Alan's wife, but as a legal worker who needed to stay calm and find the truth.

But right now, I couldn't do that.

I quickly put on my sunglasses, turned my head, and covered my mouth to muffle my sobs. The driver couldn't see me crying in the rearview mirror. I was a strong woman, Alan's wife, and a legal worker. I needed to get my emotions in check within half an hour to thoroughly investigate this.

As I cried, I thought, 'I need to find out what happened to Alan. Why did he have to go through this? Did he piss someone off? Who could have a grudge against him? That's impossible. In college, Alan and I were at the same school. We weren't together then, but we met a few times in the club. Alan was honest, hardworking. Could it be a family feud? No way. Alan's an orphan who grew up in an orphanage. He doesn't even know his parents. How could he have family grudges?'

Then I remembered that photo. All my doubts pointed to Laura.

I opened a photo Alan had shared. It was a group shot of five people from their college days. Laura was in the middle, smiling and making a V sign. Alan and the others surrounded her, looking young and full of life.

Alan had said those were the best days of his early life. But I couldn't understand how a reunion with his closest friends turned into a murder, with one of his best friends as the suspect.

By then, the car had stopped at the police station. I snapped out of it, got out, and walked straight into the forensic room.

Two police officers and a forensic doctor were waiting for me. The forensic doctor looked pretty young, and the cops were discussing something with documents in hand.

When they saw me, the police offered some words of comfort. The forensic doctor took off his mask, revealing a young face, probably under thirty.

He said, "Mrs. Smith, I'm sorry for your loss. This news must be hard to take."

He seemed to know me, which wasn't surprising since I often dealt with forensic doctors at the prosecutor's office.

I nodded and said, "Go ahead. I can handle it."

The forensic doctor continued, "The autopsy report is out. The DNA sample from the deceased matches Mr. Smith's DNA sample. However, due to your involvement, we exercised caution and immediately investigated the client information from the KTV. We quickly conducted a screening and exclusion process, and the identity verification is correct. Also, please take a look at this..."

He pulled out a sealed plastic bag with a ring inside.

My heart sank. I took a deep breath and subconsciously touched the same ring on my right hand.

"Mrs. Smith..." The forensic doctor hesitated.

My throat felt tight, and I couldn't get a word out. My vision blurred, and I felt a sudden emptiness inside, filled with Alan's voice. I managed to say, "I understand. Thank you for your hard work."

I closed my eyes, holding back the tears, trying to keep myself together. My voice might have cracked a bit earlier, but I was doing my best to stay rational.

I added, "After the case is closed, please return the ring to me. If you need any cooperation, let me know. I'm always available."

I knew the case procedures and spoke up, not to show off my professionalism, but because I didn't want to hear anything else.

I took a deep breath, pulled out my phone, opened my contacts, and called Leonard Williams, the Deputy District Attorney in charge of criminal cases, my former boss. I didn't want to make this call, but for Alan, I had no choice.

The call connected, and I greeted, "Leonard, it's Nancy."

Leonard replied, "Nancy, I didn't expect you to call. I know about the situation. When you got married..."

I cut him off, "This is a major criminal case, requiring special handling. I'm sure your criminal investigation division and the detective team are on it. Even I know so much information, let alone you. Don't beat around the bush. You must have the preliminary case file. If the prosecution moves quickly, the first trial should be in a few days. You wouldn't wait until after the trial to comfort me with a lukewarm judgment, would you? That's not what I want!"

Then I said seriously, "I am the victim's family and a licensed attorney. I have the right to be Alan's criminal lawyer, but the process is too cumbersome. I want to know some details of the case file. I know I can't access it, but I want to see it, or you can tell me the contents. You've surely seen it already."

I didn't want to hear any excuses, blocking all his possible pretexts. I wanted to know the truth and why Alan died!

There was silence on the other end of the line. After a long time, Leonard said, "From what we know, this is a clear case of arson and murder. The suspect's methods were extremely cruel. Even with my years of experience as a prosecutor, I can't bear to look at it. And the victim is..."

I interrupted him, "Get to the point. Spare me the official pleasantries. I'm not a rookie. I can figure those out myself. Tell me, who are the witnesses, their testimonies, the time and place of the crime."

Leonard said firmly, his voice carrying the authority of an experienced prosecutor through the phone, "Nancy, I understand your feelings. I trained you myself. I know your character very well. Even though you left the prosecutor's office, please believe in the justice represented by the prosecutor's office!"

I didn't deny that, but I wouldn't give up either. I didn't respond, directly asking, "Alan went to attend a class reunion. Laura seems to be the prime suspect in this case. What about the other three? Are they witnesses or suspects? What were they doing and saying at the time? Were there people in the adjacent private rooms? Where were the Entertainment Club staff?"

My voice was tinged with urgency, oblivious to whom I was speaking. I only wanted more information; I had my judgment to make!

"No comment!" Leonard was clearly angry.

"Can I attend the first trial as the victim's family?" I almost shouted, venting my emotions, even startling the forensic doctor and police officers beside me. From my words, they already knew who I was calling.

Leonard said, "Follow the procedure and then you can come. The evidence is clear, and the information is sufficient. The trial will be the day after tomorrow afternoon. Everything you want to know will be in the courtroom."

Hearing this, I hung up the phone.

###chapter 3 Joseph

When I finally left the police station, it was already past 1 a.m.

Back in school, I used to stay up late all the time, always feeling like a zombie the next day. But after I started dating Alan, I got my act together. His schedule was super strict-bed by 10 p.m., up at 5 a.m. on the dot.

I suddenly remembered the day Alan proposed to me.

That day, he said, "Early risers get this special kind of satisfaction. They feel the calm before dawn, see the night turn into day, and in that moment, realize life is pretty simple. Living like this every day is enough."

Then he smiled, paused, and added, "But for me, it wasn't perfect until I met you. You completed my life."

As he said that, he pulled out a ring, got down on one knee, and proposed.

What a cheesy proposal! I laughed so hard I almost fell over.

Alan gently hugged me and said, "You're the compass, and I'm the pencil. Without you, I'd just be scribbling aimlessly, never making a perfect circle."

Later, I told my dad about the proposal. My dad, who spent his life in architectural design, always drawing with a compass, got really mad and asked why I didn't just marry a compass and an alarm clock.

But now, it was all over. My life felt incomplete. No matter how early I woke up or how late I stayed up, I would never see him again.

I wandered through the cold autumn night, not wanting to call a cab or talk to anyone.

It was late autumn, and Alan had just mentioned paying the heating bill yesterday.

He hated the cold. With the floor heating on in winter, the house was always toasty. I'd be in short sleeves, while Alan would still be in thick pajamas, sitting upright.

I often teased him about wearing so many clothes, and he'd always smile, pull me onto the sofa, and hug me tight, saying that was the winter vibe. He loved warmth; it made him feel safe, especially with me. I was his sun.

Hearing that, I'd scoff and laugh.

Alan would get flustered, his face blushing, scratching his head and stammering, "Anyway, with you, I'm not afraid of winter."

Now, winter had come, and I realized Alan was the compass and the sun of my life.

I couldn't hold back anymore and burst into tears.

I didn't know how to go back to that cold house without him and stay calm. All the mental prep I had done fell apart. On the street past 1 a.m., I curled up in a corner, as fragile as a fallen leaf in the wind, unable to take any more.

I didn't know how long it was before I heard someone sigh beside me.

I was tired from crying, and in my daze, I had a faint, unrealistic hope. I stood up abruptly and saw the coroner who seemed to know me from before.

He was wearing a trench coat, standing silently in front of me. When he saw me look up, he showed a pained expression, his face stiff. After a long time, he nodded as a greeting and said, "Mrs. Smith... my condolences."

My mind was spinning, not understanding why he was repeating himself.

Seeing my red, confused eyes, he gave a bitter smile and asked, "Mrs. Smith, don't you recognize me?"

I looked at him carefully. He was about the same height as Alan, around 6 feet, with short hair and a beard. His face was slightly round, but there was a softness in his features, showing that he had been quite handsome in his youth, with a somewhat androgynous appearance.

"Are you... Joseph Davis?" I asked.

I suddenly remembered a pretty boy from the forensic science department at Silverlight University who loved playing female roles. He was a big deal in the opera club. Back then, he had long hair and was often mistaken for a girl. Some guys even hit on him by mistake, causing quite a scene.

In my senior year, I was already close to Alan, who was the playwright for the opera club. Even though he was busy with graduation, he'd occasionally go watch the performances and had a lot of respect for Joseph's acting skills. He told me several times that Joseph was talented and would be a star in the club's future.

"Yeah, that's me. I only found out about this a few hours ago. Seeing the body..." Joseph's eyes darkened, and he didn't finish the sentence. "After the autopsy, I cried in the bathroom. Alan was really good to me back then and taught me a lot."

He pulled out a cigarette, lit it, took a deep drag, and said in a hoarse voice, "Even though we lived in the same city, we never met after graduation. I never thought our reunion would be like this..."

After letting out all my emotions earlier, I felt a bit calmer, slowly getting back to my usual rational self. I nodded and said softly, "Joseph, I know Alan's death is hard for you too. Let's calm down. I don't think you're here just to comfort me."

I looked at him intently. For him to be here, it was either a coincidence or he had followed me. But that didn't matter. What mattered was that, according to him, we hadn't been in contact for ten years after graduation. Simple comfort wasn't necessary, at least not for me at this stage. So, if he stayed, he must have something to tell me.

Joseph looked at me with admiration, probably not expecting me to pull myself together so quickly.

"Mrs. Smith, your reputation in the prosecutor's office is well-deserved," Joseph said respectfully. "I heard you mention to Mr. Williams from the prosecutor's office that Alan went to a class reunion?"

I nodded. Alan had been talking about a few close college friends who were all coming back to Silverlight City. He said they hadn't seen each other in years and wanted to have a good reunion.

"Is there a problem?" I asked, sensing something off.

Joseph looked puzzled and said, "During the autopsy, I heard two detectives discussing the case. According to them, none of the witnesses at the scene knew him. In other words, it seemed like Alan was there alone."

"What?" I couldn't process this information.

I thought, 'What does this mean? What about the other three people? Did that mean there was never a class reunion? Then what has Alan been talking about for the past few days? Could he have lied to me? No, I trust him.'

Suddenly, I realized something, thinking, 'Why would Alan be at the Entertainment Club? He's a homebody, reliable, and meticulous. He even tends to choose cheaper restaurants when he goes out to eat, except when I'm with him. He's so quiet, loves reading, and dislikes noisy places. If it's a gathering with friends, he always picks the quietest private room in a restaurant or prefers a café. How could he go to such a high-end venue, especially one that's known as the city's most exclusive business entertainment club? Also, according to Joseph, the witnesses at the crime scene all said they didn't recognize Alan. So, what about the class reunion he mentioned?'

###chapter 4 Deception

I scrunched up my face, trying to piece together the timeline.

With the year-end review coming up, the Forestry Bureau had everyone working overtime. Alan had been burning the midnight oil for days, getting home around ten every night, messing up his sleep schedule just to make time for today so he could leave early, around 7 PM.

Alan had mentioned the meetup spot, Serene Restaurant, in the southern suburbs of Silverlight City. If it was his turn to treat for a company dinner, he'd usually pick this place because it was quiet and classy.

From the Forestry Bureau to the restaurant, it took about 50 minutes by taxi during rush hour, so he'd get there around 8 PM.

Alan was found at 9 PM at the True Love Entertainment Club. From the time the fire was put out to when the cops found Alan's body, it was about half an hour, so he must've been there before 8:30 PM. If he drove from Serene Restaurant to the city center, there wouldn't be enough time.

There was only one possibility: Alan never went to Serene Restaurant. Judging by the outcome, it was more likely he went straight to True Love Entertainment Club.

According to Joseph, witnesses at the scene claimed they didn't know Alan.

I wasn't sure if Joseph's info was reliable. With my years of experience as a prosecutor, I knew to take sudden info with a grain of salt. But one thing was clear: Alan didn't go to the restaurant; he went straight to True Love Entertainment Club.

The worst part was the possibility that Alan had lied to me. But why?

I was racking my brain, trying to sort out my thoughts, and before I knew it, I was at the bottom of my apartment building.

I glanced at the time, 3 AM.

I took a deep breath, mustered up the courage to open the door, and turned on the living room light.

I wished Alan was sitting on the couch, dozing off, waiting for me to come back from overtime, and then groggily going to the kitchen to bring out some warm food, saying, "You're back. Hurry and eat something before resting."

But there was nothing.

The shoe cabinet by the door had shoes neatly arranged on it; cups were around the dining table, with his favorite nuts on it, and the couch cushions were in their usual places... but he was not there.

My throat felt tight, and my lips started to tremble uncontrollably.

Alan's death was too suspicious. I couldn't just accept it without investigating. It would be irresponsible to him and to myself.

I wasn't the kind of woman who just accepted fate, who collapsed mentally after her husband's death, blaming the heavens but not questioning the cause of death, letting time gradually erase everything.

I was a legal worker, a former prosecutor, and the editor-in-chief of a legal journal. I needed to investigate this thoroughly.

I made up my mind, closed Alan's study, and took out the bedding from the bedroom, throwing it on the couch.

I needed to control my memories of Alan as much as possible, avoiding his study and the places we used to be together.

An emotional breakdown like last night couldn't happen again. I had to be ready to switch roles.

Then, I made a plan.

First, I'd keep Alan's death from my dad for a while. My mom passed away a few years ago, and my dad had always treated Alan like his own son. If he heard the bad news suddenly, I wouldn't be able to comfort him until I figured things out.

Second, I'd visit the Forestry Bureau tomorrow to ask about Alan's recent state. I had a vague feeling that Alan had been hiding a lot from me.

Lastly, I had to find a way to contact Alan's other three classmates and ask if they were present at the scene. I couldn't fully trust Joseph's words.

Alan often mentioned these four classmates, saying they were his best friends in college. I wasn't familiar with them in college, having only met them a couple of times, including at our wedding. Over the years, everyone got busy and contact became less frequent.

Given this, I needed to figure out why Laura would kill Alan, what their relationship was, and why Joseph didn't mention that Laura was the killer if he knew Alan from college.

Lost in thought, I fell asleep unknowingly.

In my dream, memories of our confessions, first night together, wedding, and snippets of our life flashed by like a slideshow. The scene cut to the end, with Alan looking at me with tearful eyes, as if he had a thousand things to say, but behind him was a sea of fire. He shouted loudly, "Nancy, don't come over. Leave quickly!"

"Alan!" I screamed, my foot slipping, and I fell into an abyss. I shivered from the cold, and a sharp pain shot through my elbow.

I woke up lying on the floor, the blanket kicked off. The pain I felt moments ago was from my elbow striking the table.

I liked to turn over in my sleep, often falling out of bed as a child. After we got married, Alan moved the bed to the corner and slept on the outside to block me.

I checked my phone. It was 8 AM.

There was a text message from the property management about paying the heating bill.

No matter how warm the house was, it only felt truly warm when Alan was here with me. My heart ached, and I deleted the message.

This pain was incomparable to physical pain.

Today was Friday. Normally, Alan and I would visit my dad tomorrow. I immediately sent a text: [Dad, I'm on a business trip and Alan is accompanying me. We will visit you next week.]

Soon, he replied: [OK! Hurry up and have a baby.]

My heart sank, and I replied with an OK and a grinning face emoji.

Then, I quickly washed up, grabbed my car keys, and headed to the Forestry Bureau.

Alan was a public servant, so if something happened, his superiors should have been notified immediately.

Sure enough, when I walked into the Forestry Bureau director's office, I found Henry Miller already waiting for me.

Henry was about to retire. When he saw me come in, he put on his glasses, stood up, and with a sorrowful expression, said in a deep voice, "Alan..."

As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes, and he propped himself on the table as if he might collapse at any moment.

He continued, "Alan has always been a model employee in our Forestry Bureau. I was grooming him as my successor, but I never expected..."

I sneered inwardly, 'Alan has been in the Forestry Bureau for seven years without even being promoted to deputy section chief, and now he's suddenly a successor? What kind of leaders are these?'

"Alan often spoke highly of you." I replied nonchalantly. What he thought was his own business. Then I got straight to the point, "Mr. Miller, I believe there are many suspicious points regarding Alan's death. I'm here to understand Alan's recent situation at the bureau. Has there been anything unusual?"

Hearing this, Henry adjusted his glasses, visibly relieved.

I felt even more contemptuous and mocked inwardly, 'Did he think I'm here to demand someone?'

Henry made a phone call, his voice unusually stern, "Mr. Wilson, please come to my office immediately!"

About five minutes later, John Wilson, Alan's department head, arrived at the office. When he saw me, he visibly shrank.

John was a former leader at the city's Social Security Administration. A few years ago, he was caught by the prosecutor's office for soliciting prostitutes, which also uncovered corruption issues. I handled that case. Due to his minor involvement and insufficient evidence, he was just demoted internally and transferred to the Forestry Bureau through connections.

"Mrs. Smith... long time no see." John looked a bit uneasy, repeatedly making small talk.

"Has Alan shown any unusual behavior recently?" I asked directly.

I didn't need to be polite to him. After all, he had retaliated against me by specifically choosing Alan's department to lead, and had been critical of Alan for years. This was one of the reasons I left the prosecutor's office.

John hesitated, glanced at Henry, seemingly seeking some information. It appeared he didn't know about Alan's death. I cleared my throat, and he immediately came to his senses and replied, "Alan hasn't shown any unusual behavior recently. He has been working as excellently as always, coming and going on time."

I felt disgusted by his cowardly behavior. But then I realized something was off because John mentioned that Alan came and went on time.

"Aren't you all working overtime recently for the year-end summary report?" I asked, adopting my prosecutor's authority, glancing at Henry, and staring at John. No detail could escape my eyes.

John replied, "Absolutely, the year-end materials were completed last month. This month, we've been working regular hours. If you don't believe me, you can ask others in the bureau."

My heart skipped a beat. Alan had really lied to me.

Then what had he been doing all this time?

###chapter 5 Class Reunion

After leaving the Forestry Bureau, I had to face the truth: Alan had tricked me, no doubt about it.

Since I met him, he'd never lied to me. Not once.

I remember one time, I saw him chilling on the sofa with a book. I ran over all sneaky-like and said, "Come on, spill it. Got any secret cash stashed away? Let's blow it on a fancy dinner, and you can hide the rest again!"

Alan just closed his book and laughed. "Why would I hide money? We're doing fine."

I couldn't argue with that. Then he hugged me and said, "I'll never lie to you."

"Why not?" I asked, playing along.

Alan raised an eyebrow, wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and said, "You were the former prosecutor of Silverlight City, now you're the editor-in-chief of the Legal Journal. If I lie to you, I might as well turn myself in and hope for mercy."

If the young girls at work heard this, they'd probably say I was just a love-struck woman going along with whatever my man said. But if they knew it was Alan, they'd believe it. Not because I was their boss, but because they knew Alan.

My student, Zoey Taylor, once said, "Mrs. Smith, if there's one trustworthy man in this world, it's your husband!"

So, I trusted him. Even if Alan deceived me, it had to be because he was dealing with something, not because he was hiding something from me. But I had no clue what he was up to.

After leaving the Forestry Bureau, I thought I'd never come back here. 

It was a habit from my prosecutor days. Whenever I finished an investigation, I'd pause at the door, listening to what was being said inside.

After Henry told John about Alan's murder, I didn't hear any reaction.

No surprise there. I hated this kind of workplace drama that killed efficiency and made guys like Alan do pointless work.

My phone rang; it was my boss.

"Nancy, my condolences. You've achieved so much, and I truly admire Alan for being the man behind your success." That was his first sentence, typical of his blunt style. 

Then he continued, "First, I'm giving you two months off with triple salary, as a tribute to Alan and my condolences to you. Second, regarding Alan's case, if you need anything, the whole company is at your disposal. As your boss, this is the least I can do."

A warm feeling spread through me; it was one of the few comforts I'd felt since last night. I said, "Sir, I want to investigate this case."

"Alright, go ahead," the boss agreed.

I continued, "I need you to use your connections at the student personnel archive center of Silverlight University to help me find the contact information of three people."

The boss replied, "Send me their names and any info you have, and I'll get back to you before the afternoon."

"Okay."

Before hanging up, the boss hesitated for a moment and sighed, "Nancy, hang in there."

I was taken aback but then replied, "Okay."

Besides Laura, I had only met Alan's three friends a few times, but Alan mentioned their names often, and I remembered their majors.

So I sent this info to my boss: [Mike Anderson, male, Silverlight University, graduated from the English Language and Literature program at the School of English at Silverlight University]

[Bob Moore, male, graduated from the Performing Arts program at the School of Arts at Silverlight University]

[Frank Thomas, male, graduated from the Business Administration program at the School of Economics and Management at Silverlight University.]

[These guys were all in the same year and were part of the school opera club.]

To avoid confusion with people who had the same names, I sent over their group photo from Alan's university days and instructed him to send a trustworthy person to compare in person, not to send the photo to the school.

Before the facts were clear, any related info should be kept within a small circle. It was crucial for prosecutors or investigators to keep the info sensitive and minimize the chance of complications.

The boss quickly replied: [Okay, I'll go personally. I think I know Frank, but I'm not sure if it's the same guy. I'll drive to the school now. I haven't agreed to the internship dispatch from Silverlight University to the company yet, so this won't be difficult.]

I checked the time; it was just past ten. I hadn't slept well all night, and my mind was on high alert. I drove to a nearby café to rest and gather my thoughts.

Combining the info from Joseph and my investigation at the Forestry Bureau, I started piecing things together based on the limited info I had.

I was certain Alan had lied.

He left work on time yesterday. The Forestry Bureau closed at six, so he had plenty of time after work. He could have gone to Serene Restaurant first and then to True Love Entertainment Club, or he could have gone straight to True Love Entertainment Club.

Now, I needed to verify the latter part of Joseph's info: no one at the scene knew Alan.

If what Joseph said was true, then the class reunion might not have happened, and it could be an issue between Alan and Laura alone. But if he was hiding something, then these people might be directly connected to Alan's death.

Still, something felt off. Even if they weren't there, given their relationship, they must have some idea about Laura's motive for killing Alan.

First, I had to rule out a crime of passion.

According to Alan, Laura was a big deal in the drama club back then. She was beautiful and played her roles brilliantly, naturally attracting many admirers. As a good friend, Alan often helped with love letters, but he never had any romantic intentions.

During my university days, I heard some rumors about Laura from the girls. She was indeed a prominent figure, but it wasn't an exaggeration to say she was flirtatious. Staying out all night was common, and there were even worse rumors, but I didn't dig into them because of my relationship with Alan.

An economic dispute was even more unlikely. Laura spent money lavishly in college and never seemed to lack funds.

So what was the reason? I couldn't figure out.

To be honest, I did hold some resentment towards Laura. After all, she killed my husband. But in a society governed by law, she had already been arrested as a suspect. If she was the real culprit, with such cruel means and bad influence, there was no chance of a suspended death sentence; it would definitely be the death penalty.

But Alan once said, "People come to this world not just for life and death, but for many whys, which fill the long time between birth and death."

Suddenly, my phone buzzed with several messages from the boss.

[Mike, 34 years old, an English teacher at a junior college in Harmony City. Phone number: XXX]

[Bob, 35 years old, an actor in a drama troupe in Shadow City. Phone number: XXX]

[Frank, 34 years old, the same guy I know, a manager at a foreign company in Silverlight City. Phone number: XXX]

After thanking him, I started calling them one by one.

First up was Mike. Harmony City was down south, not exactly booming economically. I called, and someone picked up pretty quickly. The voice sounded groggy, like he'd just woken up. "Hello, who is this?"

"Hi, is this Mike? This is Nancy. Do you remember me?"

There was a pause, then his voice perked up. "Nancy! What's up? Did the baby arrive?"

Mentioning the baby, I had to push down my sorrow. "Not yet! I wanted to ask you something. Has Alan contacted you recently?"

Mike replied, "No, he hasn't reached out in ages. No calls, no Facebook messages. Why are you asking about him? Did you two have a fight, and Alan ran off? He's got a temper. Don't take it to heart."

"No..." I denied.

After some small talk, I hung up. From his tone, it seemed Alan hadn't contacted him recently.

Still suspicious, I called Bob next. A woman answered, sounding wary, probably because it was an unfamiliar number. Her tone was a bit rude, "Who are you, and why are you looking for my boyfriend?"

I explained, "I want to ask about my husband Alan. He went on a business trip to Shadow City. His friend Bob is there too, so I called him. Have you seen them meet?"

"No, I haven't seen him. Bob just went to sleep, and he's been with me these past few days." Then she added earnestly, "Miss, you must keep an eye on men. You can't just take their word for it."

"Okay, thank you." I replied and hung up.

The last call to Frank was answered by his secretary, who said he was in an out-of-town meeting and could be reached later if needed.

None of them had received any news or were in the local area, which meant the class reunion Alan mentioned never happened.

I felt a bit lost, as all the info before the incident seemed to be a dead end. But something still felt off. It was like trying to fill in the blanks on a test, and my thoughts were just starting to connect the dots.

I could only wait for tomorrow's court session to get more info and figure out what Alan had really been up to.

###chapter 6 The Trial Begins

Last night, I booked a hotel and made do with a night outside.

I instinctively avoided anything that might stir up emotions and mess with my judgment, giving my stressed-out mind a chance to chill for a bit.

The next morning, I woke up and headed back home, changing into a set of black clothes.

The request I made to Leonard over the phone the night before was to attend the hearing as a victim's family member.

I lay on the couch, resting with my eyes closed. The afternoon hearing was crucial, and I needed to be fully focused on the witnesses' statements.

Yesterday's news summary showed that the class reunion was a complete fabrication, and the materials for the forestry bureau's year-end review had been completed last month.

So, what was the connection between Alan's unusual behavior lately and his accident?

I had a nagging feeling that these pieces of information were too neat, and that the investigation was going too smoothly, but ultimately, it was just suspicion without any solid clues.

The sky was gloomy, and the weeping willows outside the window couldn't resist the autumn wind, bowing and swaying their desolate branches as if in apology.

Leaves fell to the ground, driven by the autumn wind, like half-dead drunks, fluttering and stopping, eventually freezing to death in the winter.

Unlike the verdant willows of spring that danced in the breeze, a single leaf falling to the ground signified an end. The shared essence of life and time was marked by their relentless cruelty.

Every time it got cloudy, I felt down. Alan often said I was a sensitive person at heart. Then I would joke that if a sentimental person were to work in law, they might be better off writing romance dramas.

Above the couch, there was a collection of Emily Dickinson's poems that Alan often read.

Alan was a typical idealist, living a simple life with a rich spiritual world. He liked reading poetry, which I didn't understand, but I knew that poetry had little market in the country, barely surviving.

"The market can't explain everything. Of course, I'm not contradicting you, Nancy," Alan said thoughtfully, looking up. "Everyone will encounter it at a special time, either at the end of time or in the darkest moment. A line of poetry is like a lamp, reigniting their life. Of course, I hope you never understand poets or poetry. Whether a reader or a poet, they are always in pain."

I picked up the poetry collection, and one page was folded by Alan. The poem was very short.

[My life closed twice before its close-

It yet remains to see

If Immortality unveil

A third event to me,

So huge, so hopeless to conceive

As these that twice befell.

Parting is all we know of heaven,

And all we need of hell.]

Emily was Alan's favorite poet, a woman who spent almost thirty years in seclusion, accompanied by loneliness.

Alan liked reading poetry. According to him, being forced into rational work dulled one's emotions. Therefore, he occasionally read poetry to me before bed.

He had read this poem to me. Honestly, I couldn't grasp its depth. Looking back now, when Alan read this poem, he seemed to carry a deep sense of loneliness and sorrow.

I didn't know what resonance he shared with this poet and wondered if there was something in his past that he was hiding from me.

I suddenly thought that my husband seemed to be growing more distant from me, somewhat unfamiliar.

It was already 1:30 PM, and the hearing was at 2:30 PM. I couldn't afford to think too much. I changed into black clothes, quickly tidied up, and drove off.

I deliberately arrived half an hour early. Instead of sitting in the audience, I stood in a corner of the courtroom, took out a pair of sunglasses from my pocket, and observed the participants, hoping to find some clues, especially from Mike, Bob, and Frank. My suspicions about them hadn't been dispelled.

As the hearing got closer, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but then I saw a familiar face-my apprentice, Zoey.

She was looking around with a camera and spotted me right away. She ran over with red eyes and hugged me tight. "Mrs. Smith, I don't know how to comfort you. The boss said we should give you some space and let you take it easy for a while, but I can't help it. I'm really worried about you."

Zoey, a 22-year-old law intern from Silverlight University, was smart, had good writing skills, and solid professional knowledge, so I took her under my wing.

I was an only child and didn't have many friends, but somehow, Zoey and I had clicked over the past six months, and I'd come to see her as a sister.

Having dealt with the pain alone these past few days, I was really touched by her concern. I patted her shoulder and said, "I'm fine."

Zoey said, "Mrs. Smith, I want to stay with you for a few days."

I replied, "We'll talk about it later. Go sit down; the hearing is about to start."

With that, I walked straight to the audience seat, and the hearing officially began.

The presiding judge, associate judges, jurors, clerk, and prosecutor entered in sequence. This case was a big deal, and it was presided over by the first court of Silverlight City.

The jury had seven people, and the presiding judge was Stephen Jackson, a man in his forties with a stern face, known for his seriousness. He was an experienced criminal judge and a member of the judicial committee. The government was really taking this matter seriously.

The prosecutor was my former boss from the district attorney's office, Leonard. Leonard noticed me and glanced in my direction. I thought for a moment and then greeted him with a nod.

Having the deputy district attorney act as the prosecutor was rare in public prosecution cases. The prosecutor's office was also giving a lot of attention to this case. But personally, this was my husband's case, and I appreciated the gesture.

I felt slightly relieved as Stephen announced the True Love Entertainment Club Arson and Murder Case was officially in session and called the defendant to the court.

This was my first time seeing Laura in person again after ten years of my marriage. Laura seemed a few years younger than Alan, probably in her early thirties.

Time hadn't left any marks on her. She looked the same as ten years ago. Her features weren't particularly delicate, but together, they exuded a natural charm, especially her eyes, filled with wildness, desire, and a hint of ruthlessness.

Escorted by the bailiff, she slowly walked to the defendant's seat, looking around.

I had seen this scene before. In the university drama club, when she took center stage as the lead actress and took her bow, she had the same expression.

I slowly took off my sunglasses and met her gaze. At that moment, I no longer suppressed my emotions, like venomous tongues of fire, ready to engulf her.

Our gaze met briefly, yet she didn't linger, as if she had never seen me before, but the slight smile at the corner of her mouth was caught by me.

I thought, 'The experiences at the police station these past few days haven't affected her at all. Is her mental strength really that strong? If she could commit such inhumane acts, what couldn't she do?'

Thinking of this, a chill ran through me.

After Stephen read out the charges and rights against Laura, Leonard began to accuse her of the arson and murder at the Entertainment Club.

"Honorable Judge, Prosecutor." Laura held her head high, looked directly at Stephen, and said firmly, "I am not guilty!"

###chapter 7 Laura's Speech

The courtroom was packed, but most folks had no clue about the gruesome details of the case. Our paper only got the photos thanks to the boss's connections.

The real draw? Laura. She was the city's youngest theater star, and every show she did was a sellout. She even started her own talent agency. Gossip about her was always hot, keeping the media buzzing.

People loved to see someone successful fall from grace.

No one gave a damn about Alan's death. To the public, an unknown person's suffering was just another news headline.

I couldn't shake my discomfort with this era of over-the-top entertainment.

When Laura claimed she was innocent, the place went nuts.

The two reporters next to me snickered.

"Look at her. She still thinks she's on stage!"

"Yeah, she can't kick her stage addiction. Is she gonna quote that line from Land of Ice next?"

"I am the king of the people, the laws, the nations. I will break the shackles of fate, dance before the gods, and no one can judge me. I will crown myself!"

"Well, a crown's out, but handcuffs fit just fine."

"Order!" A stern voice cut through the noise. Stephen said seriously, "The defendant will continue with her self-defense."

I noticed the chaos didn't faze Laura at all. She seemed to enjoy it.

In past murder cases, suspects were either out of their minds or totally out of it in court. But Laura was different. She was mentally sharp and eager to speak.

Did she have a histrionic personality?

Psychologically, she had to be tough to commit such a brutal crime and still be so composed after days of questioning.

It didn't add up.

Looking at the relationships among the five college friends and Alan's recent odd behavior, Laura's claim of innocence made some sense.

Laura scanned the room, still smiling. "You all came to see me fall, to witness the tragic end of a theater artist, but I won't give you that satisfaction. What you see might not be real. People love lies. If you're too weak, you'll be controlled by fate."

She paused, then continued, "Ladies and gentlemen, Alan was my soulmate, the best playwright, a poet who understood me, and the one who introduced me to acting. He was the perfect man in my life. Why would I kill him so brutally? I've fought against fate and the world, but I've always had a special tenderness for him."

Then she said, "My statement is over. From now on, my defense attorney will handle the details of this case."

With that, Laura bowed deeply to the crowd, like it was the end of a grand performance.

Leonard and Stephen frowned, clearly unhappy with her statement. It was a mockery of the court's solemnity and irresponsible to herself.

As a prosecutor, I'd been in court many times, but I'd never seen a suspect act like this.

Laura wasn't just crazy. She always spoke in such an over-the-top way, like she was performing.

I remembered my wedding with Alan back in 2014. Laura was all over the place, toasting everyone like she was the host. She drank several guys under the table and then jumped on stage to belt out an impromptu aria from The Magic Flute, The Queen of the Night's Aria.

Thinking about it now, it all came back to me. During the guest blessing segment, she was different from everyone else. She said, "People favored by fate have such beautiful smiles. If you aren't good to Alan, I'll kill you. I'm very good at this. Oh no, I'm just kidding. Don't get so excited."

I remember her eyes so clearly. It was like she had control over everything, and there was this weird hint of malice when her eyes slightly drooped.

"I hope it's just a joke; otherwise, I won't hesitate to take on the role of prosecutor." I smiled and met her gaze directly. At my wedding, hearing such words, I had to respond.

"Interesting. Mrs. Smith, we will not meet again." She said and walked away without looking back.

Those words from the wedding ten years ago turned out to be a prophecy. Here we were again, but this time in court. She was the suspect, and I was the victim's family member.

I sat in the audience, staring intently at Laura.

"Defendant, correct your attitude. The law grants you rights, but it also imposes obligations you must fulfill." Stephen's face was cold as he slowly said, "On the night of November 10, 2024, around 9 PM, which room were you in at the True Love Entertainment Club? What were you doing?"

Laura sighed, looking helpless. It seemed this question had been asked a million times. She said lightly, "Room 5 on the fourth floor."

Stephen asked, "Why did you come here? Did you have an appointment with someone?"

Laura replied, "I come here often, to hang out with friends. Your Honor, it's consensual, not prostitution."

Stephen frowned and continued, "Room 7 on the fourth floor is opposite yours. Do you know who was inside?"

Laura hesitated for a moment and then said, "It was Alan."

Stephen said, "Defendant, according to the investigation, the DNA found under your fingernails matches the victim's. How do you explain this?"

"I was having fun with my friend, and the door to the room wasn't closed. Alan might have seen it and thought I was being attacked, so he fought with that person. I accidentally scratched Alan's hand while trying to break up the fight." Laura said, looking at her nails.

My heart skipped a beat. As expected, Alan went straight to the Entertainment Club instead of Serene Restaurant. What was he doing there?

Stephen continued, "Defendant, we found a surgical knife used for dissecting bodies in the corner of the crime scene. Your fingerprints were on the knife. Please explain your statement."

"I don't know. After my friends left, I was very tired and fell asleep on the sofa." Laura said.

Stephen said, "Defendant, according to the statement of the Entertainment Club's cleaner, during the entire time of the incident, only Room 5 and Room 7 had guests. In other words, no one else had the opportunity to commit the crime. How do you explain this?"

The information presented in court flashed quickly through my mind. The time, place, and suspect all matched. Laura's statement seemed weak. Where did her calm confidence come from?

At this moment, the defense attorney, who had been silent, stood up and said, "Your Honor, a crucial piece of information has been overlooked. Near 9 PM, just ten minutes before the victim's death, there was a power outage! At that time, no matter who came, it was impossible to investigate! I insist on pleading not guilty for my client."

###chapter 8 The Witness (1)

Laura's lawyer, Scott White, a top-notch criminal defense attorney in the state. He'd tackled some seriously tough cases over the years and had built quite the reputation.

I thought, 'Is Laura so confident because of him? But all the evidence points to her. Any defense attorney, seeing the situation going south, would usually discuss with their client to see if they could lessen the sentence. Yet he insists on pleading not guilty. Why? Is it because of Laura's sky-high legal fees? But a lawyer like him wouldn't risk his career for just some money.'

While I was lost in thought, Stephen wrapped up the questioning, handed out the case files to the judges, jurors, and prosecutors, and once they were done reviewing, he called the first witness to the stand.

The first witness was the janitor from True Love Entertainment Club. She looked about sixty, not very tall, really thin, dressed plainly, and was nervously looking around, clearly not used to being in court.

"My name is Tammy Martinez. I'm the janitor at the Entertainment Club. On the night of November 10, 2024, I was on duty, cleaning the 3rd and 4th floors." Tammy clutched her clothes, looking flustered. She continued, "Your Honor, if I testify, will I be safe? I'm scared!"

Stephen replied, "Don't worry. The suspect is in custody, and we'll take protective measures if needed. Please just tell us what you saw that day."

"Okay." Tammy patted her chest and sighed. "Around 8 PM on the 10th, this woman went into private room 5, came out shortly after, and stood at the door like she was waiting for someone. After a bit, a young guy went upstairs. They barely said a word before they started kissing! Shameless!"

"What were you doing at the time?" Stephen asked.

"I was cleaning the private rooms, picking up trash. I saw them when I came out to mop the hallway." Tammy replied.

Stephen said, "Please continue."

Tammy went on, "I felt somewhat embarrassed, so I coughed. Then, they entered the room, kissing passionately, without even closing the door. They left it ajar, and the entire hallway echoed with the woman's moans. She was both protesting and enjoying it simultaneously. A born harlot. Who knows what other misdeeds she's committed? She should be sentenced to death immediately!"

Stephen interrupted, "Please stick to the facts. Did the victim go to the defendant's private room?"

Tammy nodded. "Yes, I heard sounds of a scuffle inside. I was about to call someone at the door of private room 10, but I saw the victim come out, so I didn't bother."

"Got it." Stephen nodded, signaling her to continue.

Tammy said, "Not long after, the young man left, and the woman took a bottle of wine and a paring knife and went into private room 7."

"Paring knife?" Stephen picked up on that.

Tammy paused, thought, and said, "Yes, the long kind. I'm not sure, but it was probably a paring knife."

Stephen picked up the evidence, a scalpel, and asked, "Like this?"

"Yes, exactly, thin and long!" Tammy immediately replied.

Stephen asked, "What happened next?"

Tammy replied, "Suddenly, the power went out, and then private room 7 caught fire, spreading to the adjacent rooms. Everyone was busy putting out the fire and found someone burned to death... No, they were murdered. I've never seen such a cruel woman in my life!"

Tammy's eyes were filled with hatred as she screamed loudly, hurling continuous insults at Laura. The bailiff quickly came up to calm her down.

I felt a pang of pain in my heart. Even though I wasn't there, the horrific scene in the photos was something I never wanted to see again. If the witness was so shocked, how much worse was it for me, the victim's wife?

Tammy was led out of the courtroom by the bailiff, stumbling a bit, clearly a mess emotionally. Unless professionally trained, an ordinary person witnessing such a scene would likely lose control even more than Tammy.

Then it hit me-something was off. 

What was the initial emotion that an ordinary person would feel upon witnessing such a scene? 

An ordinary person, upon witnessing such a scene, felt fear, terror, and an instinct to flee. It could induce nightmares and become an unforgettable memory for a lifetime.

They wouldn't be angry, shouting, and crying in court. 

I'd never seen this woman before. I knew all of Alan's friends and family, and there was no Tammy, no one with the last name Martinez. Her reaction was just too weird.

"Call the next witness!" Stephen ordered.

As I was mulling this over, the second witness walked in. She was a young woman in her twenties, named Lally Rodriguez, a waitress at the Entertainment Club.

Stephen asked, "Lally, you work at the Entertainment Club?"

"Yeah, I've been here for three years," Lally replied.

"Is the defendant a regular?" Stephen asked.

Lally nodded, "Yep, she comes about three times a month."

Stephen continued, "Who does she usually come with, and what does she do here? Did you serve her this time?"

"I served her this time, not before, but everyone knows her at the club. She always comes with different young guys," Lally said, glancing at Laura and sneering, "What an artist, looking all glamorous but changing men like clothes."

Stephen asked, "What did you see during the incident?"

Lally replied, "Laura came to the club, and I greeted her on the first floor, then took her to a private room on the 4th floor. She ordered a fruit platter and a bottle of wine. Then I left but stayed nearby. For top members like her, there's always someone assigned to be available."

"And then?" Stephen prompted.

Lally continued, "Then, as usual, a man went up to the 4th floor. But shortly after, the man in private room 7 went into private room 5. There was a scuffle, and it got pretty loud."

"Was it the victim?" Stephen asked, showing a photo and having the bailiff pass it to her.

"Yes," Lally answered clearly, "The 4th floor is for VIPs only, so I know all the members, but I didn't know this guy. He must've been new. The commotion quickly subsided, so I didn't think much of it. About twenty minutes later, the man left. Then the power went out, and you know the rest."

"Wait!" Lally seemed to remember something, "When the power went out, I heard a strange scream. At the time, I thought someone was causing trouble during the blackout, but later, thinking back, it sounded more like... a cry for help."

"Where were you when the fire started?" Stephen asked.

Lally replied, "I was on the first floor, contacting the electrician. When I was about to go up, the fire was already huge. I was scared and didn't dare go up."

Lally finished her testimony.

The whole testimony seemed fine, but something felt off to me.

First, when Lally answered Stephen's questions, her eyes weren't on the bench; she kept glancing at Laura.

Second, her answers were too smooth. She didn't show the usual nervousness or discomfort that witnesses often have, especially compared to Tammy. When Stephen showed Alan's photo, she immediately said it was him, almost like she didn't even look at it.

Third, and most unusual, during Lally's testimony, I watched Laura closely. Facing these accusations, she got really quiet, totally different from how she was at the start of the trial. It was like she was lost in thought. Even when her lawyer spoke to her, she didn't respond.

Something was definitely wrong. Both Laura and the witnesses had big issues!

###chapter 9 The Witness (2)

Stephen called out, "Bring in the next witness!"

A middle-aged guy, Tom Harris, stepped up, looking around 35, slim build, rocking a fancy Brunello Cucinelli suit and gold-rimmed glasses. He had that whole refined, scholarly vibe going on.

Stephen said, "Tom, before you start, remember, you can only talk about what you saw yourself, not what you heard from others. Got it?"

Tom nodded.

Stephen went on, "We gotta trust the court to be fair and protect our rights. We're not scared of power or authority here!"

I frowned, thinking, 'Stephen didn't say this to the other witnesses. Is he stressing this to Tom because he noticed something off with the earlier testimonies?'

Tom adjusted his glasses and smiled, casting a brief, inadvertent glance at Laura before saying, "Your Honor, don't worry. I'll only talk about what I saw. That's my job. Whether it helps the case or not, that's not up to me."

Stephen nodded and asked, "Were you at the True Love Entertainment Club around 8:30 PM on November 10, 2024?"

"Yes," Tom replied.

Stephen continued, "Which room?"

Tom said, "Room 6 on the 4th floor, right next to where the fire happened."

Stephen asked, "What were you doing before the incident, and who were you with?"

Tom replied, "I had a meeting with a client at 9 PM."

Stephen said, "So, you were alone the whole time?"

Tom replied, "Yes, as the meeting time got closer, the club caught fire, and I ran downstairs."

Stephen looked at Tom, whose calm demeanor betrayed no hint of his thoughts, and asked, "When the fire broke out and people got hurt, did you help anyone?"

Tom shrugged and said, "Your Honor, I'm not the owner or manager of the club. I didn't think it was my job to help in that situation."

Stephen continued, "Did you notice anything unusual before the fire in the room next to yours?"

Tom adjusted his glasses again, glanced at Laura, and smirked. "Nothing unusual, but the defendant had some interesting interactions with two guys."

Stephen asked, "Two guys?"

Tom explained, "Yeah, one was a young guy, probably in his twenties. Seems like the defendant is a regular at the club and knows the rules well."

Stephen frowned and asked, "What do you mean?"

Tom said, "Nothing much, just that it's all consensual. The 4th floor is for VIPs, and the club doesn't interfere with what people do in their private rooms. They protect their clients' privacy."

Stephen ordered, "Tell us everything you saw and heard."

Tom replied, "For the first guy, there's no need to go into details. But soon after, another guy, the one next door, barged in, and there was a confrontation."

"Tom, the rooms at the club have thick soundproof walls. How did you hear that?" Stephen pointed out the flaw in Tom's story.

That was what I wanted to ask too. The club's walls were soundproofed. He shouldn't have heard anything from the next room.

Tom explained, "I don't like staying alone in dimly lit, enclosed spaces, so I kept the door open."

I couldn't help but think, 'Tom has claustrophobia? With his polished look and demeanor, he seems like a high-flying business guy. How could he have such a condition?'

But his story matched up with what the other two witnesses said. Alan did go into Laura's room and had a run-in with another guy.

Stephen prompted, "Go on."

Tom said, "I thought the guy was the defendant's husband, waiting next door to catch them in the act. Since my client hadn't shown up yet, I sat on the sofa by the door to watch the drama unfold. To my disappointment, I didn't see the scene I imagined. The guy went back to his room shortly after, and the young man looked scared and left soon after. But not long after, the defendant took a drink to the gentleman's room. When she saw me, she smiled slightly. She's really beautiful. Having such a wife must be quite exhausting for her husband."

Tom's smile grew more playful as he spoke.

"Tom, please stick to the relevant topics and avoid unnecessary comments and baseless speculations," Stephen reminded.

Tom said, "Okay, when I was about to eavesdrop again, my client called. There was noise from the next room, and I was worried it would disturb my client, so I closed the door. After finishing the call, I was about to eavesdrop again when the power went out."

The club's enclosed design meant that when the power went out, it would be pitch dark, which would be torturous for someone with claustrophobia. I remembered a government official I once interrogated who also had claustrophobia and was terrified when the power went out. But I couldn't recall who that official was.

Tom continued, "I am very afraid of the dark. So I ran out to call for a waiter. At that moment, I accidentally heard loud noises from the next room, but I couldn't care about that. I ran forward in the dark, slipped, and fell, and smelled gasoline. I panicked even more."

This was new information. After Laura entered Alan's room, they had an argument, and the smell of gasoline explained the fire.

On the other hand, Tom's testimony filled in the gap from the power outage to the fire.

"Tom, are you sure you heard arguing from Room 7 and smelled gasoline outside?" Stephen's voice was loud. This was new evidence. In an arson and murder case, such a large fire with no flammable materials in the room must have been deliberately set.

Tom nodded. "I'm sure. The smell of gasoline in the dark is something I'll never forget."

Stephen asked, "How many voices did you hear?"

Tom replied, "Just two."

Stephen continued, "Are you sure?"

Tom said, "Yes."

The witness session ended. The manager of the Entertainment Club was also supposed to testify, but he was injured in the fire and couldn't make it.

The testimonies of the three witnesses were similar, but the third witness provided crucial information about the power outage and the fire. Based on the testimonies and evidence, Laura's arson and murder charges seemed undeniable.

As I was organizing my thoughts, I noticed Tom looking around as he returned to his seat, seemingly searching for someone.

When he saw me watching him, he quickly averted his gaze. At the same time, I observed something more important. He glanced at the janitor, Tammy, with a look that suggested they knew each other.

###chapter 10 Full of Doubts

With all my years in the legal field, I had this gut feeling something was off about these three witnesses. From the start of the trial, I just knew something wasn't right.

But I had no solid proof. Just a hunch from their looks and the way they talked, but that wasn't enough to go on.

Lally and Tammy both swore up and down that Laura was on the 4th floor and never left.

Tom's story filled in the gaps about what went down during the blackout and the fire. He said Laura had a fight with Alan in his room and that he smelled gasoline.

Time, place, people, actions-it all lined up perfectly.

Even though the club manager didn't show, these three had Laura pinned as the prime suspect.

By the book, the court should sentence her to death, and the truth would come out. Alan's death would be avenged, and I should feel like justice was served and get ready for Alan's funeral. But I couldn't shake the question-why would Laura kill Alan?

During the trial, Laura's over-the-top statements were almost like a performance, kind of manic. To the media, it probably looked like she was trying to play the judge by using her performance artist background.

But I still remembered the wedding ten years ago vividly, and with what Alan had said before, I couldn't help but believe her.

Plus, Tammy's emotions were all over the place. Lally kept staring at Laura while testifying, and Tom kept glancing at Tammy after he spoke. How did a business elite and a cleaner even know each other?

Their stories were too perfect, fitting together like a puzzle, all pointing straight at Laura.

Why did they want Laura dead?

Just as I was mulling this over, the defense attorney Scott, who had been quiet, suddenly stood up and said, "Your Honor, I have something to say!"

Stephen looked at Scott and said calmly, "The defense may speak."

"With nearly perfect evidence, if I were the judge, I would certainly find the suspect guilty." Scott raised his voice, standing tall, now looking like the famous lawyer known for shaking up the courtroom and even making young judges squirm. 

He paused, a slight smile on his lips, and then continued, "I don't doubt the witnesses' testimonies. I believe in the fairness and strictness of the law, and the shining light of justice behind it! But, I want to ask the judges, the prosecutors, and everyone here in the courtroom."

Scott then said loudly, "Based on the case files and the witnesses' statements, we can piece together the timeline. Around 8:50 PM in 2024, there was a power outage. The witnesses said the fire started within minutes and spread fast. The fire department had it out by around 9:15 PM, all in less than twenty minutes!"

He continued, "In less than twenty minutes, if you take out the time for the suspect and the victim to interact and the struggle leading to death, the remaining time would be used to dissect the victim's organs one by one and hang them from the ceiling. Isn't it unbelievable that the suspect is a woman without much strength?"

Scott added, "I believe you've all seen the autopsy report. I haven't seen the victim's body, but I watched the autopsy video. Even though the body was burned, some knife wounds were still visible, smooth and deep, showing skilled use of the knife and strong wrist strength. Plus, the precise location of each organ suggests the perpetrator is an experienced surgeon, not my client, Ms. Brown!"

He raised his voice and said, "Secondly, the key witness in this case, the manager of the Entertainment Club, isn't even here. From what I know, only hotel staff got hurt. We still don't know if there were other people on the fourth floor that night or if there are other suspects!"

Scott wrapped it up, "Based on 'innocent until proven guilty,' I demand a not guilty plea for my client! Even if we go by the city's rule of 'special cases handled specially,' for big cases to be processed quickly to deliver justice and sway public opinion, we need more evidence, not just a quick conclusion!"

Scott's face was stone-cold, his voice loud but flat.

The courtroom went dead silent. Everyone had been so focused on the witnesses' stories, they hadn't thought about the case itself. Laura was an artist, not exactly a powerhouse. How could she dissect someone and hang their organs from the ceiling in just a few minutes? Even a top-notch surgeon might struggle with that.

I wasn't shocked by Scott's move. A lawyer of his caliber wouldn't risk his rep on a case without solid grounds. Now it was his turn to shine.

As the victim's family, I usually didn't get to see the case files directly. Leonard hadn't shared the case details with me before the trial either. Thinking about this, I glanced at Leonard at the prosecutor's table. He looked serious, flipping through the files. He must've felt my gaze because he looked up briefly before going back to reading.

'Does he have doubts about this case too?' I wondered.

Scott's statement only strengthened my doubts. Alan's death needed a thorough investigation, not just to find the killer but to understand why it happened. This case couldn't be rushed.

As expected, Stephen finally said the defense's points were valid, and the case would be postponed for more evidence.

Scott nodded to Laura, got up, and left. Laura didn't say a word and was taken away by the cops for further detention.

Zoey ran over, looking like she wanted to say something. I gently told her to focus on her work and that I'd contact her if needed. She reluctantly left the courtroom.

I hung back a bit, watching the three witnesses leave and quietly followed them in the crowd.

Lally pulled out her phone to call a ride. Tammy grabbed her bike from the rack outside the courthouse, and Tom headed to the parking lot. Soon, a Mercedes drove out and sped away.

They all left separately, no interaction at all. But I still couldn't shake why Tom looked at Tammy.

That look wasn't random; it was a look of concern and curiosity.

Plus, Lally and Tammy both worked at the Entertainment Club, so they should know each other. After such a big event, even if they weren't close, they'd talk after the trial, not just split up like that.

Watching the crowd slowly make their way down the steps, I had this nagging feeling there was a secret between them. 'What's their deal, and why did they give such pointed testimonies in court? The evidence isn't enough to nail Laura, but these three clearly wanted her gone. Why? Does it tie back to Alan? What's their connection?'

Just then, I heard a cold snort from behind.

###chapter 11 The File in Hand

Looking back, it was Leonard, the current Deputy Chief Prosecutor and my old boss.

We hadn't seen each other in three years. He looked rough, with bags under his eyes and skin like old tree bark. A few years ago, he had just a few gray hairs at his temples, but now they were completely gray.

If I remember right, he was only fifty.

Time was a killer for women and a curse for men. Women aged slowly, but men seemed to age all at once. After forty, time became a vengeful ghost, tearing at them, eager to strip them to the bone. This was the price of ambition and power; now time wanted its payback, with interest.

I felt a bit sorry for him and forgot our past issues for a moment. "Leonard," I called out.

Leonard nodded, still stern, and slowly walked down the steps. When he looked at me, there was a flicker of the old him in his eyes. He hesitated, his dry lips moved like he wanted to say something, but it turned into a sigh, "Nancy, my condolences."

Seeing his expression, my heart sank. After the long trial and intense focus, I was exhausted, and the sadness started to creep back in.

Back then, during the office dispute, I hated the bureaucracy, the ruthlessness of my colleagues, and especially Leonard's actions. Three years ago, I told him in his office that he had betrayed the prosecutor's oath and turned into a power-hungry politician.

Alan supported my decision but sighed, saying Leonard had his struggles.

Leonard had mentored me. I remembered his proud look when I was commended by the state prosecutor's office, and his anger and disappointment when I left.

This world was tough on idealists. With Alan gone and Leonard aging, I felt a deep sadness, realizing everyone just wanted to get by.

For a moment, we both fell silent.

"Is there a problem with the witnesses?" Leonard got straight to the point.

"Yeah, something feels off, but I can't put my finger on it. I want to investigate. I don't just want the killer caught; I want to know why Alan was killed. Besides, Laura might not be..."

"That you can still be like this after what happened to Alan shows I wasn't wrong about you." Leonard sighed, pulled out a stack of photocopies from his bag, and handed them over. "Just this once!"

I was stunned. The victim's family wasn't supposed to see the case files without going through the proper channels. What Leonard did was definitely illegal, which was unlike him.

"Scott is slick, but he's top-notch nationwide. What he said in court makes sense. This case needs quick, accurate, and ruthless handling, but the state court is pushing too hard. I was only notified this morning to be the prosecutor." Leonard paused, seemed to think of something, but held back, in his usual mature and steady way. Then he said in a deep voice, "Don't overthink it. If you want to investigate, go ahead, but let me be clear: you can't act in the name of the prosecutor's office, and don't be impulsive. You've got guts!"

My eyes reddened, and just as I was about to speak, Leonard waved his hand, walked down the steps, stopped after a few steps, and said slowly without looking back, "If you have any difficulties, let me know. And if you want to come back... we'll talk about it later."

With that, he left.

I got back to the car and started going through the case file. Most of the stuff had already come up in court, but there were four big red flags.

First, the autopsy report was super vague, just a few sentences.

Second, the club's surveillance footage had issues recently, and the video was incomplete.

Third, the list of injured people was missing some names. They could be folks who were actually there.

Fourth, there was no list of guests on the fourth floor of the hotel that day, which should be managed by the Entertainment Club's manager.

This case file was a mess, full of holes, and missing key info. While the speed of handling the case had been commendable, the efficiency was regrettably poor, unlike the thoroughness seen in previous "special cases."

It looked like someone wanted to wrap this up fast.

From Leonard's expression earlier, he probably noticed this too. Investigating the higher-ups was out of my league for now, so I'd need to ask him later.

I had to start from the bottom. It seemed like these three witnesses had issues, and there was also the manager who hadn't shown up.

I needed to figure out if Alan and Laura's meeting was planned or just a coincidence, and if the other three had really not been in touch recently.

I had to dig into both sides at the same time.

Just then, my phone rang. It was my boss.

He asked, "Nancy, Frank's secretary just contacted me. It's about an investment project. We need to meet Frank tomorrow at noon. You in?"

I replied, "Yeah, what time?"

He said, "11 o'clock, VIP Table 3 at Darben Coffee. I've made the reservation."

"Got it," I said.

When I talked to Frank's secretary yesterday, she said he was out of town for a meeting. How did he get back so fast?

I decided to check out Alan's three friends first.

The next day at 10:30, I headed out.

There was some traffic, so I texted my boss that I might be a bit late.

When I got to the coffee shop, I was already about 10 minutes late. From a distance, I saw my boss stand up and wave at me, so I hurried over.

A man was sitting across from my boss, must be Frank. The info I found said he was a manager at a foreign company. I expected him to be like the court witness Tom, in a branded suit and gold-rimmed glasses, looking all successful.

But Frank was in sportswear, looking pretty plain. When he saw me, he slowly stood up, looking sad and worn out.

"Nancy, Alan..." Frank said, his voice trembling, almost sobbing. I noticed he didn't look well, his face pale and sickly.

I replied, "Yeah, he passed away the night before last."

Frank covered his mouth, one hand shaking as he held onto the chair, sobbing softly. In his thirties, in his prime, he looked like an old man about to collapse.

Seeing him so heartbroken made me feel even worse. Even though we hadn't seen each other in ten years, I felt a bit closer to him and quickly went over to help him sit down.

As I turned, I glanced at my boss, casting an inquiring look to ask if he had conveyed the news of Alan's murder. My boss shook his head slightly, indicating he hadn't.

Currently, the authorities had not disclosed any information about the victim of this case, and even the entertainment media had not reported on it.

So how did Frank know?

###chapter 12 Testing

"Damn it! I'm the one who's sick. Why did Alan have to go before me? Oh God, I'm the one who's supposed to die. Why did you take Alan instead?" Frank cried out. He was in such bad shape that after just a few words, his voice got all raspy, and he looked pale as a ghost.

"Frank!" My boss called out, jumping up to grab a bottle of medicine from Frank and quickly giving him a few pills.

After a bit, Frank finally calmed down, slumping weakly in his chair, looking ashen and breathing shallowly, muttering something under his breath.

"Frank, calm down. You can't get too worked up with your condition," my boss said.

"Frank, you... need to take care of yourself," I said softly, my eyes red.

Frank waved his hand and said hoarsely, "Maybe it'd be better to die sooner. Living is just suffering."

He looked at me, his eyes filled with sadness and loneliness, like he was seeing Alan. Then he slowly closed his eyes and turned to look out the window.

It was late autumn, and the leaves were falling, making everything look so desolate.

At that moment, Frank seemed like a fallen leaf in the wind, lonely and drifting.

Frank's expression wasn't fake, but with such a good relationship, why hadn't they met in years? Did they know about Laura and Alan meeting at the Entertainment Club?

I started to doubt Alan's story about the class reunion, but now wasn't the time to ask.

Frank stared at the dead leaves outside the window for a long time, then said, "I have a tumor. The pain is unbearable, and it's incurable. Back then, I wanted to end it all, but Alan asked me why the leaves are golden?"

He smiled, lost in the memory, his eyes misty, with a hint of pride.

"He said it's because they love the sunlight and life, even in their final stage, and they want to shine with the color of the sun. So I kept going, and we became friends," Frank sighed, filled with endless loneliness. "I live in this world to compete, but winners are few. Most of the time, I end up failing. But Alan was different. He was passionate, brave, unyielding, like a hero. Nothing could defeat him. Now, he's gone, and I have to bear all the pain alone. It seems like the distance between me and failure, death is getting closer."

When Frank turned back, he was already in tears.

"Frank, even though Alan is gone, the case isn't solved yet. I need to investigate it, to give Alan an answer," I said solemnly, trying to change the subject. 

On one hand, Frank's health looked very poor, and too much grief could worsen his condition. On the other hand, I wanted to steer the conversation towards the case. I didn't come here to cry with someone. I wanted to gather as much information as possible.

"Yes, Frank, you need to take care of yourself," my boss, Howard Martin, quickly agreed.

Frank nodded, suddenly glanced at my boss, then at me, and coughed a few times, saying, "Ask away. I want to know about Alan too."

It seemed he already knew my purpose. He had quickly regained composure and shifted emotions amidst great sorrow. He indeed wasn't an ordinary person to be a high executive in a foreign company.

"Frank, we came today mainly for the investment..." Howard started to explain quickly.

"It's okay, Mr. Martin. We've known each other for years, and Nancy isn't an outsider," Frank said, suddenly remembering something. "My secretary said a lady called the day before yesterday. Nancy, that was you, right?"

"Yeah," I nodded. "Has Alan been in touch with you recently?"

Frank shook his head and sighed, "No, I've been abroad since graduation. I only came back in the past two years, traveling all over the country, rarely back in Silverlight City."

I asked, "What about the others?"

Frank replied, "None either. We were all centered around Alan. Mike and Bob contacted even less."

When he said this, Frank's eyes were a bit evasive. Alan once said they were all very close, and that back then Mike was the vice president of the student council, doing very well in college, seemingly their backbone. How did it become Alan according to Frank? 

I just asked if he had been in contact with Alan recently, but he immediately stretched the timeline back to graduation. Wasn't this overly sensitive?

Was he deliberately hiding something?

"Nancy, tell me the truth, is there any progress in Alan's case? I just heard about it this morning, haven't had time to ask. Has the killer been caught?" Frank asked urgently, but to me, it seemed like he was deliberately changing the subject.

I looked at him deeply. He didn't mention one person's name when talking about their close relationship. 

I said meaningfully, "Laura."

Frank said, "What's with Laura? You mean... it's Laura!"

He was stunned for a moment, then suddenly understood. His whole body seemed drained, and he looked up in disbelief, followed by anger and hatred filling his pale, sickly face. At this moment, his expression was almost hideous.

"She's really crazy." Frank's eyes widened, completely losing control. He struggled to stand up and look around, as if Laura was nearby.

A person in extreme anger couldn't fake it. His sickly body exuded a bloody smell, like a starving beast making a final deadly struggle.

"Where is she?" He stared at me and asked.

"Frank, calm down. The first trial has just ended. Due to some evidence issues, it's been postponed," I comforted him. It seemed he only knew Alan had been killed, but didn't know the suspect was Laura.

Frank calmed down and said directly, "No doubt. Alan must have shown you photos of the five of us. The reason I didn't mention her is that Alan didn't tell you about another layer of our relationship."

"What?"

"Laura and I had a brief relationship in college, then we broke up. The reason..." Frank sneered, a trace of resentment flashing in his eyes. "You must have heard a lot about Laura's scandals over the years. She's always self-centered, unscrupulous, a crazy woman. I regret what I did that night and regret knowing this woman. It's my fault. Why would I mention such a woman? I never thought this woman would go so far as to kill Alan! She deserves to die! She betrayed Alan's friendship and us!"

When Frank said this, he looked like a demon from hell.

###chapter 13 Detached House

After leaving the café, it was already around 1 PM.

Howard gave me a quick rundown of Frank's situation, which pretty much matched what he had just said.

Frank had been abroad for years and only came back to the country in the last two years because of some business changes. Since returning, he hadn't stayed put in Silverlight City but had been traveling all over for business deals.

The guy was a total workaholic with a crazy drive. Even though his illness was serious, he had a strong will to live and had bounced back from the brink of death multiple times, which was a well-known story in the business world.

Howard had other stuff to do, so I grabbed lunch on my own, mulling over our conversation from earlier.

At the end of our meeting, Frank mentioned that apart from Alan's wedding, he hadn't seen Laura again. Then he went off on a rant, cursing Laura and saying she could never make up for her sins. I just sat there, listening, knowing these outbursts were pointless.

Since the day before yesterday, I had questioned all three of Alan's college buddies. They really hadn't been in touch recently, and there was no college reunion. From what Frank said, he didn't know about Alan and Laura meeting either.

The weird thing was, Frank described their group dynamic as being centered around Alan. But I clearly remembered Alan always saying Mike was the main guy. This stuck with me because Mike was the vice president of the student council back then and was a big deal in college.

I thought, 'Why did Frank change their story? Maybe he's closest to Alan? But it doesn't make sense for him to say Alan is the central figure to me; it seems too ordinary for someone like him. The only reason could be that he's trying to distance himself from the other two.'

All deductions pointed in one direction: they must have been in contact over the years, perhaps multiple times!

I had a hunch that Alan's accident might be tied to some coincidence involving these people. But I had no clue what their purpose or the content of their contact was.

Questioning the three of them further seemed pointless since Bob and Mike were out of town, and I wouldn't get any useful info.

It made more sense to start with the case itself and look into the witnesses from the trial.

Thinking this, I pulled out my phone and quickly sent a message to Howard: [Help me check Tom's personal info. He's one of the witnesses in this trial. From his appearance, he seems to be from your business circle. I suspect there's something off about him. Zoey also saw him at the trial.]

Howard replied soon: [I'm not very familiar with him. I'm just a magazine owner, not an info hub. You should ask your friends at the prosecutor's office. Aren't you tight with them?]

Nancy: [Leonard just gave me a copy of the case file yesterday. It's not cool to bug him again.]

Howard: [You're so impressive. I told you, Leonard isn't as bad as you said. Never mind. I won't say more, or you'll be persuaded back, and I'll lose out. Leave it to me. Do you want me to check the other witnesses too?]

I thought about it. Lally and Tammy worked at the Entertainment Club, and I needed to check the scene myself, so it was better if I did it. I replied: [No need. I'll check the rest myself.]

With that, I drove to the True Love Entertainment Club, not far from the city center.

Even though the city center was the busiest part of Silverlight City, it was also an old district. The city had gotten a facelift over the years, but the road layout still followed the old plan. The café and the Entertainment Club weren't far apart, but there were so many traffic lights along the way that it took me half an hour to get there, which made me a bit anxious.

When I finally arrived, I was blown away by what I saw.

This Entertainment Club wasn't super fancy. I wasn't into all that glitz and glamour anyway. What really surprised me was that while the city center was packed with buildings over twenty stories high, the Entertainment Club was a standalone six-story building. It didn't look old, probably built within the last ten years.

The Silverlight City government had put out a rule in the early 2000s that buildings in the city center below fifteen stories couldn't be built.

The location was pretty clever too. It was on the edge of the city center, not accessible by a main road but by a single-lane road after leaving the main road. Most people wouldn't even find this place. But if one followed this single-lane road, it took less than five minutes to drive back to the main road of the city center. The only explanation was that this road was specially built for this building.

I'd been around Silverlight City for years, driving back and forth in the city center many times, but this was the first time I came here, and I had never noticed this road. This place seemed to be hidden in plain sight in the city center.

No wonder the True Love Entertainment Club was so famous in the city. True luxury wasn't about the decor but about having an entire building and road built specifically for the club.

I frowned, thinking, 'Doesn't the municipal department manage this place? There must be some serious corruption behind this.'

My prosecutor's instinct kicked in, and I shook my head.

I parked by the roadside and walked towards the Entertainment Club building.

Entertainment Clubs usually operated at night, so there weren't many people around during the day. As I got closer, I noticed that the entrance of the Entertainment Club was sealed.

I had been thinking too much these past few days and had forgotten that these entertainment venues must be closed for rectification after the arson and murder case.

I looked around. Besides this Entertainment Club building, there were no other buildings. I thought carefully and realized that there might be two reasons why no one had reported it over the years. 

First, this Entertainment Club was high-end, and ordinary people couldn't afford it; second, there were no other buildings around, so there was little foot traffic, and those who came here wouldn't report it.

At that moment, a food truck drove towards the small road and stopped not far from me.

A man in his fifties got out of the truck and quickly set up his stall, displaying his sign, Ronald Food Truck.

I checked the time; it was 1:30 PM. Lunch hour was over. What was he doing setting up a stall now?

I walked over, and he glanced at me, chuckling, "What would you like? It's all written up there."

I looked at the menu next to the sign, which had all the usual snacks. I randomly ordered a burger and found a stool to sit down.

The owner skillfully started the fire and added ingredients to the pan while asking, "Do you prefer a stronger or lighter taste? You look new here. Is this your first time? Want to add an egg?"

I didn't answer his question but asked, "Hello, sir. Do you usually have many customers here?"

The owner, who was making the burger, suddenly stopped.

###chapter 14 New Discoveries

He looked pretty flustered and just shrugged, "You got me. It's my first time here too. I have no idea about the foot traffic in this area, but let's give it a shot. Making money ain't easy."

The food at these little stalls was usually the same; it all came down to location and timing.

They were usually in busy spots, and different times of the day had different prime locations. Typically, it was during rush hours and after 9 PM, going until 2-3 AM. That was when the most customers showed up, and even without regulars, business was decent.

Judging by how smoothly he drove over, it didn't seem like his first time here. I noticed the dark oil stains on the roadside, which clearly showed this was his usual spot.

As he talked, the owner brought over the burger. I didn't call him out, just pulled out a cigarette my dad had left in my bag and handed it to him.

Seeing the fancy cigarette, he took it with both hands, thanking me over and over, "You're too kind!"

I said, "Seeing you work so hard reminds me of my dad. He was just like you, driving around in all kinds of weather to make a living. It's tough."

He pulled out a lighter, lit the cigarette, took a deep drag, and looked satisfied. The mood lightened a bit. He asked, "So, miss, what brings you here?"

"Looking for a job." I glanced at the small building and made up a reason. "A friend recommended me for an interview here."

He nodded, looking relieved. He took another puff and slowly exhaled, lost in thought. Then he said, "Having a daughter is better; they care about their dads. Sons are useless, just fooling around all day!"

Sensing he had more to say, I quickly added, "Sir, you can't say that. It's normal for men to start their careers late. Many only begin in their thirties or forties. In a few years, he might earn you a building like this."

I pointed to the True Love Entertainment Club building.

He shook his head, "I'd rather my son stay a quiet failure. If he actually builds a place like this, it would be a disaster for our family!"

Hearing this, I knew something was up. I handed him another cigarette, pretending to be surprised, saying, "Is there something wrong with this place? Could my friend have tricked me? Please tell me more."

He took the cigarette, sighed, and said, "You seem kind-hearted. Do you really not know what this place is? Think about the girls coming out of here at this hour every day."

As I suspected, his words confirmed my thoughts.

A standalone entertainment club in a bustling downtown area, with people coming out around 1 PM, living a night-turned-day lifestyle-what else could it be besides a place with hostesses?

It seemed this place had significant issues.

"I'm here for an accounting interview." I pretended to be surprised and slapped my forehead, saying, "Sir, I almost forgot. I saw on the news a few days ago that something happened here. Now, it was shut down."

He sneered, "The shutdown is for show. Lock the front door, but open the back door. It's business as usual. Just wait. People will start coming soon. Miss, I can't comment on your friend, but I advise you to stay away from here."

I replied, "Thank you so much! Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do next!"

I pulled out the pack of cigarettes and offered it to him. He waved it off, insisting the meal was on the house. I thanked him a bunch of times, packed the burger, and got back in the car.

I didn't drive far, just turned a corner and parked. I got out and hid at the corner, where I had a clear view of the back door of the Entertainment Club.

It didn't take long before a few young girls came out, yawning and with messy hair, looking like they had just woken up. They headed straight for the food stall.

The guy was right. Officially, the place was under renovation, but it was still operating on the down-low. The Entertainment Club's business didn't seem entirely above board.

I remembered the court testimony where a witness said Laura often brought friends to the VIP room on the fourth floor. I thought it was just guests bringing friends in, with the club protecting members' privacy. Now it seemed the club was also involved in organizing prostitution.

Soon, I spotted a familiar face, the first witness in court, the cleaner Tammy.

She looked like she had just finished her night shift, keeping a deliberate distance from the girls who had just come out. Considering her disdainful remarks about Laura bringing friends, she probably looked down on these girls.

She seemed cautious, looking around for a while before pushing her bike from the corner and heading towards the food stall.

I quickly got back in the car and followed her slowly. Passing the food stall, I saw the owner busily preparing food. He greeted me cheerfully when he saw my car, and I nodded, closing the window. 

Suddenly, a thought struck me: he seemed utterly unfazed by my return.

Was I overthinking this?

At the fork ahead, afraid of losing Tammy, I cleared my mind and followed her slowly, keeping a distance.

Tammy's home was far from the Entertainment Club. After about half an hour, she finally stopped and chatted with a fruit stall owner.

This place was Sand Village, a village within the city near Technology Road in Silverlight City's development zone. With the city's development, such villages were becoming rare. It was one of the few remaining, well-known in the area.

I had previously covered a case about Sand Village's unresolved demolition issues, which led to conflicts and a large-scale violent incident.

As long as someone knew Tammy, it would be easy to investigate further.

Parking was tough in the village, and it was notorious for its gang presence. Driving a strange car in could cause trouble. So I turned the car around, found a parking lot, and walked to the fruit stall where Tammy had stopped, asking, "Sir, how much for the fruit?"

The owner replied, "Pomelos are in season and selling fast, and the pears are very sweet!"

"Hold on. Let me ask my aunt what she wants." I pretended to call someone by dialing my own number, muttering to myself, "Why isn't she answering? She said she'd wait here. I don't know what she wants. Maybe I'll come back later."

I made a few more calls, carefully selecting fruit.

The owner, seeing a potential sale slipping away, said, "Are you looking for someone here? Ask me. I know everyone!"

I couldn't help but smile. Years of interviewing and tracking people had taught me the ways of these small vendors. I replied, "I'm looking for Tammy. Do you know her? I'm her niece, visiting from out of town."

The owner replied, "I know her very well! We just chatted. Go straight ahead, and turn left at the third alley. It's the fourth door!"

###chapter 15 A Strange Family

Carrying several dollars' worth of fruit, I walked through the entrance of Sand Village.

Over twenty years ago, before Silverlight City became what it was today, it was just a little place called Sand Town.

Back then, the town was dirt poor, mainly surviving off a local steel mill. The mill was doing alright, and most of the workers lived around here, so the area got some decent policies. This village was one of the first spots in Sand Town to get a proper underground water system.

But as time went on, the big wave of reform hit the country. The steel mill started tanking, leading to massive layoffs. The young folks took off to find work elsewhere, and eventually, the factory packed up and left too.

Only the older generation stuck around, but they couldn't do much. The glory days of Sand Village were over. The place fell apart, no one took care of it, and it turned into a hangout for the poor.

Now, Sand Village had grown quite a bit; otherwise, it wouldn't have made it into the government's plans. The alleys were spread out, and after years of neglect, sewer pipes were sticking out by the roadside, spewing sewage and stinking up the place. With all the restaurants nearby, the mixed smells made the sanitary conditions pretty awful.

I remembered my colleagues talking about Sand Village, saying the rich kids in Silverlight City wouldn't be caught dead here because they didn't want to dirty their expensive shoes.

Hearing that made me uneasy. A lot of young people come to Silverlight City to hustle, with no support, spending their first few years in Sand Village. This place was the starting point for many rural and out-of-town youngsters chasing their city dreams.

Back in the day, after Alan graduated, he secretly lived here for a bit. When I found out, I was pissed and ready to move him out of Sand Village. He stopped me, saying it was too dirty and unsafe for a girl to come in. He moved to my place with his bags that day.

He paid me rent every month, not a penny less than the market rate. It was a matter of pride for him, and I accepted it until we got married.

In the blink of an eye, more than ten years had flown by.

Wearing heeled shoes, I felt even more uncomfortable walking on the bumpy road. I walked with uneven steps, careful not to trip and fall.

At that moment, I felt a sense of revisiting an old place, even though it was my first time here. Seeing the dilapidated buildings, the illegal extensions, and the greasy food stalls around, I felt a mix of emotions.

After about a ten-minute walk, I arrived at the fourth gate of the third alley, just like the fruit vendor had described.

The gate was ajar, rusty, and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. The door knocker was covered in a thick layer of grime. Through the gap in the door, I saw a small courtyard. On the left was the kitchen, and on the right was an outhouse. Directly opposite was a three-story building.

The top floor looked newer, probably added and rented out to other tenants. The first floor was the most rundown, with strips of rubber hanging between the doors and windows, dangling in mid-air. The door had a tattered curtain, still hanging despite it being late autumn.

The three-story building had an iron staircase hanging outside, making the already small courtyard feel even more cramped.

Just as I was hesitating about whether to go in, a woman burst out of the second-floor house. She looked around twenty-seven, with striking features, heavy makeup, and an irritated expression. She was in pajamas, her hair a mess, and she clattered down the iron stairs like they might collapse any second.

She stormed into the first-floor house and immediately started in, "Mom, how many times have I told you not to work there? Going out at night and coming back during the day, how is that okay?"

"What else can I do? Tony Thompson is working his butt off day and night, and you just stay home all day, laughing and chatting on your phone. Does that make money? If I don't go out, how will you two get by?" Tammy shot back, clearly annoyed.

It seemed like the woman was her daughter-in-law. I was about to step in but decided to hang back and get a feel for Tammy's family situation first.

"But you can't keep doing that," the young woman complained, her tone dripping with frustration. "You go out at night and come back at noon, and in those shady places, people in the alley are starting to gossip. What exactly are you doing all day?"

Tammy snapped, "Shut up! Isn't it you who spreads everything around? I earn money honestly, unlike you..."

I heard a loud thump, like someone slapping the table. Tammy was clearly pissed. It seemed like their relationship was pretty rocky, and the young woman wasn't exactly tactful.

The young woman shot back, "I'm an honest online streamer. Without the gifts from my viewers, Tony's salary wouldn't even cover my makeup. He always brags about being a network engineer, but he's just a keyboard-pounding editor. Does he really think he's a high-income earner? What a joke!"

"Keep your voice down! If the neighbors hear you, you might not care, but I do! Tony's not here today, so let me make it clear: no more live streaming! What livestream sales? Where are the goods? When Tony's not around, what kind of clothes do you wear, and what do you say? Do you really think I haven't seen it? Our family may be poor, but we never do shameless things!" Tammy's voice was trembling, low but full of anger.

I was starting to piece it together. Tony's income wasn't great, working as an editor, and his wife was probably doing online streaming, relying on viewer gifts for money.

"Who are you calling shameless? Isn't being ungrateful and biting the hand that feeds you shameless?" the young woman shouted. "Everyone in Sand Village knows that your son is ungrateful, living off the family, and then wanting to demolish Sand Village. The demolition compensation is so little, and he says he tried his best. It's bad enough he treats the villagers like this, but he doesn't even come home. You work so hard outside, and he earns so much money. When has he ever given a penny to this family?"

Tammy sneered, "I know my son better than anyone. When you got close to Tony, was it really because you liked him, or were you just after his money? Calm down. We can get by somehow."

"How have I wronged your family or Tony? How can you talk like that?" The young woman cried, almost hysterically. "I married Tony at a young age and have been living a hard life. Did I say anything? Didn't I marry him because he's honest? But you're always saying sarcastic things to your son. Do you think it's easy for me?"

It seemed Tammy had another son, possibly tied to the village's demolition a few years back.

I pushed the door open and stepped in, asking, "Hello, sorry to bother you. Is Tammy home?"

###chapter 16 Interview

The young woman was clearly annoyed by the interruption. She yanked the curtain aside and snapped, "Who is it? She's not here!"

I stood at the door, flashed a polite smile, and showed my press card. "Hi, I'm the chief reporter from the Silverlight City Legal Journal. I'm here to interview Tammy."

"The demolition happened years ago. Isn't it a bit late for that?" The young woman rolled her eyes. Not wanting to argue with Tammy in front of me, she said, "Come in."

I got it. They thought I was here to talk about the bloody mess during the Sand Village demolition years back. I decided not to correct them and stepped inside.

The place was dark and cramped, probably a big flat turned into a tiny two-bedroom apartment. One room was likely Tammy's bedroom, and the other was locked.

The living room had an old TV draped with a purple cloth. Above it hung a black-and-white photo of a young man, probably in his thirties, wearing work clothes with "Sand Town Steel Plant" barely visible.

I pieced it together. This was Tammy's husband, who had passed away over twenty years ago. She really had a tough life.

I felt a pang of sorrow, thinking of Alan and myself.

Tammy sat on a peeling sofa, looking stern, glaring at the young woman, who rolled her eyes but stayed quiet, motioning for me to sit.

Tammy glanced at me and snorted, "What's there to say? We've been through this so many times, and the government never cared."

It seemed she didn't recognize me. That day, I was in the victim's family section, wearing sunglasses and dark clothes. I remembered she glanced at me. 

Feeling reassured, I gently said, "Ma'am, I'm not..."

"Not what? My son was beaten and disabled by the demolition team-no, not a team, but a bunch of thugs. They're not human. The injury report and hospital diagnosis are all there. And then? A few thousand dollars in compensation. Every reporter promised to report and advocate for us, but none of them wrote anything!" Tammy started crying as she spoke.

The young woman sneered, "Isn't it your ungrateful son who hurt his own brother? Sand Village hasn't seen such a traitor in decades. Does he dare to come back now?"

"Anna Perez!" Tammy shouted angrily, but upon seeing me, she seemed worried about losing face in front of a stranger. Her voice softened, and she began to sob quietly. "Miss, don't listen to her nonsense. It's not his fault... it's my bad luck."

I sighed. Over the years, I'd seen too much suffering.

Some said that for ordinary people, 99% of problems could be solved with money. This seemingly insightful internet saying was actually harmful.

Not everyone was obsessed with money. Money couldn't measure happiness accurately. The poor could be happy, and the rich could suffer. Often, good people faced misfortune, while evil people went unpunished.

I called this mysterious, unmeasurable thing fate.

Alan, Tammy, and I were all caught in its web.

I said, "Ma'am, hi, I'm Nancy Johnson, the chief reporter for the Silverlight City Legal Journal. You can call me Nancy. A few years ago, the Sand Village demolition conflict shook the city. I haven't seen any reports about your son's situation. If you trust me, give me your contact info. I'll have someone follow up and write a special report. I promise it'll be on the front page, and I'll personally deliver the magazine to you."

As a woman who also lost her husband, I couldn't just stand by. I placed my business card in her hand, which was cold and rough from years of hardship. 

Seeing Tammy's tearful eyes, I felt deeply moved but didn't forget my purpose. I continued, "However, ma'am, my main reason for being here today isn't the demolition conflict but the recent True Love Entertainment Club arson murder case. You testified as a witness. I'd like to know the details of the case. Is that convenient for you?"

When I finished, Tammy's hand trembled, and she slowly collected herself, returning my card, saying, "There's nothing to say. I said everything in court. I don't understand the law. If I say something wrong, I'll be in trouble. Our family can't afford that."

'Indeed, there's a problem,' I thought.

Anna, who had been playing with her phone, ran over, asking anxiously, "Mom! Why didn't you tell me about such a big thing? Does the murderer have anything to do with you? Don't hide it!"

"Tell you for what? To make a story for your live stream?" Tammy snorted, "I'll say it again, I said everything in court. I have nothing more to say. As for the demolition, thank you for your kindness, but I've lost hope."

I didn't push further, stood up, and looked at the black-and-white photo on the wall. I sighed and said, "Alan was my friend, an ordinary person like the man in the photo. Dying at this young age is a great misfortune. It's unfair to them, and you understand that. But it's not just unfair to Alan. For his wife, it's a huge blow. Losing her husband in her thirties, raising a child, how can she fight in this city and face the future? Living in despair and pain for the rest of her life? You understand that even more. I'm not trying to bring up your pain, but you know the hardships. Now, the same fate has befallen another woman. Put yourself in her shoes. Her husband is gone. She just wants to know why he died. Don't you want to say something?"

Tammy stared blankly at the photo on the wall. The man in the photo had blonde hair, while hers was gray because of twenty years of longing and despair.

Tears fell. She opened her mouth, wanting to say something, and sighed, "What do you want to know?"

###chapter 17 Tammy's Loophole

"Thanks a lot, on behalf of my buddy and his wife," I said, genuinely. Even though I was keeping my identity under wraps, what I said was true. In a way, if Alan's death stayed a mystery, the current Tammy might very well be a reflection of myself twenty years from now.

In court, I always felt like Tammy's testimony had some holes, but that didn't mean what she was saying now was the gospel truth. I still needed to dig for clues in her story.

"Can you walk me through what happened the night of the incident?" I asked, pulling out a pen and notebook, turning on the recorder, and getting ready to jot down notes, pretending I hadn't been at the trial. Meanwhile, I kept an eye on Anna, who was fiddling with her phone. If Tammy slipped up, Anna would definitely react.

After grilling her with a bunch of questions, her answers matched what she said in court, down to the timeline, where she was, and what she was doing.

I paid close attention to Anna's reaction, which didn't change. She put down her phone and listened intently, occasionally throwing in a question or two. She seemed super interested in anything about Laura, probably because Laura was a celeb, and gossip was gold for someone who spent all day on live streams.

But as Tammy recounted the events, I had a hunch and asked, "Ma'am, you mentioned earlier that you saw Laura meeting the first guy before the incident. What were you doing at that time? I didn't catch it earlier. Could you repeat it?"

Tammy thought for a moment and said, "I was cleaning the private rooms, picking up trash. I saw them when I stepped out to mop the hallway."

That was the problem!

I nodded and, using the excuse of a faulty recorder, I put on my headphones and quickly rewound to that part.

The two statements were identical, word for word. It hit me why something felt off when I first asked Tammy. Her testimony was too perfect, no slip-ups.

Now I got it. Her statements in court, during the interview, and just now were exactly the same, not a single word different!

There was only one explanation: she memorized her testimony.

I thought, 'Who made her memorize it? Tom, Lally, or someone else? In criminal law, collusion and tampering with evidence are serious crimes. Why take such a huge risk to frame Laura? Could it be because of the Sand Village demolition case from a few years back? That doesn't add up either. Laura's in the arts, not real estate. Even if that reason holds, what about Lally and Tom? Did they live in Sand Village or have ties there? Probably not. Such coincidences don't happen. But one thing's for sure: she knows the truth, at least part of it, and she's hiding it.'

All my previous questions were about the witnesses and the case itself. I decided to switch it up and ask something less related to the case to catch her off guard. "I heard the Entertainment Club got shut down. Did you go to work today?"

"Officially, it's shut down, but it's still running on the down-low. Otherwise, how would the boss make money? How would I get paid?" Tammy said casually.

I asked with a grin, "Do you know who the big boss is? Maybe I can write a column about it."

Tammy shrugged, "How would I know? That's not something regular folks like us would be privy to."

I nodded and threw another question her way about the Entertainment Club, "How long have you been working there?"

"About two years, I think," Tammy replied after a moment.

I glanced at Anna, who was rolling her eyes, and realized Tammy was right. Anna had always been unhappy with Tammy working at the club.

"Finding a job is tough these days, especially for someone your age. Kids should be more understanding," I smiled at Anna as I spoke, trying to smooth things over. I closed my notebook and turned off the recorder, signaling the end of the interview to help her relax.

"I'm just worried about Mom. You know that place, right? There are all kinds of people, and they start shouting after a few drinks. I'm just worried she can't handle it," Anna said, showing she was smart enough to keep the peace in front of an outsider.

"Alright then, thanks for your cooperation. Today's interview was really helpful!" I stood up, ready to leave, and handed my business card to Tammy. "I'll keep my word. I'll look into the Sand Village demolition case and your son's situation, then write a special report to try and get the compensation your son deserves."

Tammy and Anna thanked me repeatedly.

"Oh, I almost forgot to give you a card too. You know your husband's case well," I said, handing a card to Anna.

As I was about to leave, I turned back and asked with a smile, "By the way, do you always work the night shift?"

Tammy looked surprised and said, "Yes, why?"

I replied, "Nothing. It's just that the immune system of older folks isn't great. This kind of lifestyle can be really tough on your health. Take care of yourself."

"Thank you," Tammy said.

"Alright, I'll be going now. Sorry for the long disturbance. No need to see me out. We'll be in touch," I said, looking at Anna. When I asked Tammy about working the night shift, I saw a flash of panic in Anna's eyes, which told me Tammy was lying.

After leaving, I called my apprentice Zoey. She picked up right away.

Zoey sounded excited, "Mrs. Smith, you finally called me. Where are you? I'll come over right away!"

She probably didn't dare call me and had been waiting for my call.

I felt a warm glow inside and said gently, "It's okay. No need to come. I just want to ask, where do young people in their twenties usually like to hang out? Somewhere relaxing, upscale, preferably a trendy restaurant. I don't go to these places much, so I'm not familiar."

Zoey replied, "There's a restaurant not far from Brookside Road. The food there is pretty good for the price."

"Okay," I said.

In late autumn, it got dark early. Around six in the evening, the sun was almost setting. I walked out of Sand Village slowly, holding my phone, waiting for a call.

Soon, I got a text from an unknown number: [Ms. Johnson, hello, this is Anna. Can we meet?]

###chapter 18 Meeting Anna

Our meeting was set for tomorrow at noon at the Jazz Age Restaurant on Brookside Road.

When I got home, I gave Howard a call to check on his investigation into Tom. Turned out, Howard had been on a business trip and didn't have much info yet. All he knew was that Tom was into internet investment finance. He asked if I was in a rush.

I thought about it and realized that investigating into Tammy's lead was making progress. Trying to chase both leads at once would probably be too much. So, I told him not to worry and to focus on his own stuff first.

After a lot of hesitation, I sent a message to Leonard at the prosecutor's office, letting him know I'd been to Tammy's place and had solid info that her testimony had issues. I also mentioned I was meeting her daughter-in-law tomorrow.

Leonard's reply was short: [Good.]

I wanted to ask Leonard about the Sand Village demolition conflict from a few years back, since I promised to look into it. But knowing Leonard, he wouldn't break his principles. Giving me a copy of the case file was already a big exception. I decided to ask Zoey after meeting Anna tomorrow. I remembered our newspaper had covered the incident back then; perhaps we could find some useful info in the archives.

The house was a bit chilly. This was my old family home, facing east and west, cold in winter and hot in summer. My parents moved to a new place in the western suburbs of Silverlight City when I was in high school.

When I was in college, Silverlight University was closer to this house, so I commuted between the dorm and home. After getting married, my dad offered to pay for a new house, but Alan and I refused, thinking our current place was enough. We planned to buy a new house once we saved enough and decided to have kids.

We kept putting it off, never had kids, and now I found myself alone, destined to grow old in solitude.

When Alan was around, he'd pay the heating bill early, grab the electric heater from the study, and warm up the place. He'd sit on the sofa reading a book. He usually stayed in the study, but in late autumn, he'd do this. When I asked, he said he wanted me to be warm too.

I flipped through the book Alan had left on the sofa, a collection of poems by William Butler Yeats. It looked pretty worn. As I casually flipped through it, I often felt like touching these poems was like touching Alan's fingers and delving into his soul. This was the only warmth I had when I came home.

[Dear, come close to me; since you left, my desolate thoughts have chilled to the bone.]

I remembered this book originally belonged to my dad. When my mom passed away in 2018, my dad quoted this poem at her memorial service. He said he had recited it under her dorm window when he was courting her. Later, he gave the book to Alan, saying it was a form of inheritance, a continuation.

The living room grew colder, as did my lifeless heart.

I picked up my phone and scrolled to my dad's contact. We used to call each other every few days, but I'd been too busy lately to even send a message. After my mom passed away, my dad seemed as carefree as ever on the surface, but late at night, he'd silently stare at her photo.

Thinking of Tammy, my dad, and myself, I realized we were all lonely souls, silently standing on the banks of time's river.

Just then, my dad sent a message: [Nancy, remember to pay the heating bill. Alan gets cold easily. Hurry up and have a baby.]

I replied: [Okay.]

With tears in my eyes, I lay on the sofa, sleeping in the cold house.

The next day at noon.

I drove to the Jazz Age Restaurant on Brookside Road a bit early. The vibe of this place was pretty nice.

I asked Zoey to recommend this spot because it was quiet and perfect for a chat. Plus, young girls like Anna, especially those who were internet influencers, would probably love trendy places like this for taking photos and sharing on social media. It should be right up her alley. After all, I needed to get some crucial info from her.

Soon enough, I saw Anna coming upstairs, snapping photos with her phone. She looked like she had put a lot of effort into her outfit, looking super fashionable, not at all like someone from a rundown area.

"Over here," I called out, waving to her. Anna quickly walked over and sat down. I explained, "I'm not sure what you like. My friend recommended this place, and it's my first time here too. Let's give it a try."

I smiled and called the waiter to order. I went for most of the signature dishes.

Anna's eyes lit up as she took photos of the dishes, chatting about how she had wanted to come here for a long time, where she had eaten before, dining etiquette, classic dishes, and so on. She also complained about the environment around Sand Village. It was hard to imagine she lived in a rundown area.

Of course, I didn't look down on her. On the contrary, I believed that young girls at this age should try new things within their means. After all, life was about enjoying these little pleasures. Living with constraints was no different from being a prisoner in shackles.

I waited until Anna had eaten a bit before asking, "So, what do you want to talk about?"

Anna replied, "Ms. Johnson, I'm sorry for the scene yesterday. You know how it is with in-laws; every family has its own issues."

I nodded. Compared to yesterday, she was indeed more polite this time.

Anna wiped her mouth and said, "I'm here for two things. I want to know why you're so eager to help Tony. As far as I know, his family doesn't know any journalists. Otherwise, the compensation issue wouldn't still be unresolved."

I was a bit taken aback. Anna's vigilance was understandable, given that in today's society, pure goodwill was rare. In a way, I was no different.

I casually played with the grilled meat on my plate as I spoke, "First, I'm a journalist and have worked in legal affairs before. It's part of my professional ethics. Of course, I won't mention justice as a reason. Second, it's a form of exchange. I want to learn about the True Love Entertainment Club arson-murder case, so I need to make some effort to get that information. It's both personal and professional. I hope this answer satisfies you."

Anna replied, "No problem. Now, let's talk about the second issue, my mother-in-law."

"What's the matter?" I asked, trying to contain my excitement.

Anna said, "You gave me your business card before you left, asking me to stay in touch. I'm not stupid. Tammy put on quite a show, even fooled me, but you managed to catch her in a lie with your questions. Ms. Johnson, you're a smart person, so I'll be straightforward. I want to know if Tammy will go to jail if she didn't tell the truth."

###chapter 19 The Suspect

Anna was like, "Don't even look at me. I have no clue about Tammy. I heard what she said for the first time yesterday too. She's super secretive, and I don't know much about their family stuff! Damn Tony! He just listens to his mom all the time, like a total pushover. He's useless, has no skills, makes little money, and has almost every bad trait a guy can have. But if something really happens to Tammy, he definitely won't be okay. I really don't like her, but I'm not trying to throw her under the bus. Even though Tony is useless, he can't be without his mom."

This time I met Anna, she was almost surprising. Yesterday, in front of Tammy, she was sharp-tongued, showing no respect for her. But today, she seemed more mature overall. I wondered if this was what the relationship between in-laws was like. 

Alan was an orphan and had never seen his parents, so naturally, I hadn't been through the usual mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship.

"You've thought it through very well. To be honest, what you just said surprised me a bit," I said sincerely.

"Do you think I'm an unreasonable, money-grubbing person?" Anna laughed self-deprecatingly.

"Not at all. Let's get back to Ms. Martinez. You mentioned she lied about something earlier," I changed the subject.

Anna looked hesitant, thought for a while, and then mustered the courage to say, "She hasn't always worked the night shift. It's only been in the past two weeks or so. She suddenly started working the night shift, and we've argued about it more than once."

I nodded. Yesterday, I did hear them arguing at their door, mentioning the night shift. Anna wasn't lying.

The suspicion about the witness testimony could now be confirmed. Tammy not only gave false testimony but was also involved in this matter. Several people conspired together to target Laura, trying to put her to death.

Combining this with Scott's final statement in court, I had a bold idea: the real culprit of this arson and murder case might be someone else.

When I came to this conclusion, I was shocked. I was actually trying to exonerate a husband-killer! But then I thought, 'The case is still unclear. Laura is still under police control. If it really is her, she won't escape the law's punishment. But if it's not her, Alan's death would be a grave injustice.'

The whole thing became more and more confusing.

Seeing me in a daze, Anna called out, "Ms. Johnson?"

"Sorry, I was lost in thought," I quickly apologized.

Anna asked, "Tammy... will she get into trouble because of this? She's a bit overbearing usually, but she definitely wouldn't kill anyone. I regretted sending you the message yesterday, but I was really worried that hiding it would have worse consequences, so I came to you."

"No, the case has been postponed for further investigation. Testimony isn't always considered direct evidence. Maybe she just remembered wrong. Has Ms. Martinez been acting strange lately? If you know anything, please tell me." I could only comfort her like this for now. 

Tammy conspired others to give false testimony, and if she didn't correct it or explain her reasons, she would definitely face legal consequences. But I couldn't say this in front of Anna.

Anna thought for a moment and then said, "She's pretty much the same as always. She usually sleeps lightly, and after coming back from the night shift, she wakes up after just about three hours. Nothing else unusual."

I asked, "What about the day of the incident, on November 10th?"

"Nothing unusual, I think," Anna said, then added, "Oh, she did mention her old leg problem flared up that day, and she couldn't walk, so Tony took her to the Entertainment Club on his motorcycle."

Tony was at the Entertainment Club that day too!

I shuddered, trying to keep my cool, and asked in a calm tone, "What time did they leave?"

"Around 7:30, and he came back close to 9," Anna replied.

The incident happened around 9 PM that night. From Sand Village to True Love Entertainment Club, it took Tammy about half an hour by bicycle. I had followed her and calculated the time. By motorcycle, it would take at most 20 minutes.

From 7:30 to 9, there was an hour and a half. Subtracting 40 minutes for commuting, there were still nearly 50 minutes left. What was Tony doing at the Entertainment Club?

The timeline didn't match the incident, but it didn't mean Tony had nothing to do with the case.

I nodded, seemingly changing the topic but actually leading it towards Tony. "Alright, let's put this matter aside for now and talk about the demolition. Ms. Martinez said Tony was disabled from the beating. Where was he injured, and what level of disability is it?"

Anna suddenly fell silent, her face turning a bit grim. She stared at the sausage on her plate with a mix of resentment, hatred, and anger. She picked up her fork and stabbed the sausage hard. After a long time, she said sadly, "Ms. Johnson, what do you think is the most devastating pain for a man?"

I was stunned, slowly nodded, and didn't ask further. I finally understood Tammy's hysterical cursing at the demolition team. It turned out that they assaulted Tony, leaving him impotent. I felt a bit more sympathy for Tammy.

I continued, "Yesterday, you mentioned Ms. Martinez's other son who betrayed the family. Who were you referring to? How many children does Ms. Martinez have? It seems related to the demolition."

Anna sneered, "She has two children. The other one is Zack Garcia, older than Tony."

"Zack Garcia? Shouldn't his last name be Thompson?" I asked.

"I don't know," Anna shook her head, curled her lips, and laughed. "Maybe she was promiscuous when she was young and brought a child into her current marriage. I'm not making this up. I heard it from people in the village. Zack and Tony have completely different personalities. Zack is smart, did well in school, and has been scheming since he was young. He got into a good university, Silverlight University. On the contrary, Tony is dull, talks little, and is not very bright. He only got into a community college."

"How's the relationship between the two brothers?" I asked.

"I heard it was good, but ever since Zack did that treacherous thing, they haven't seen each other and Zack hasn't come home! That ungrateful bastard! Maybe Tony's injury was his doing!" Anna said through gritted teeth. "Tammy still defends Zack to this day. Just because he makes more money, does that make him great? He didn't give her even a penny!"

###chapter 20 Internet Company

I asked, "So, what's Tony up to these days? If you don't mind, maybe our editorial team can help out. Don't stress about it. I was close to the victim and saw what his wife went through, so I can't help but feel for Ms. Martinez. Helping out a bit more is the least I can do, especially since you and Ms. Martinez have given me so much info about the case. It's just fair."

I actually overheard Tammy and Anna chatting at the door, but if I straight-up asked for Tony's work address, it would look suspicious. So, I had to be subtle.

"He's working as a new media copywriter at an internet MCN. I got him that job!" Anna said proudly. It seemed like she, being a streamer in Silverlight City, had some connections in the industry, so she could hook Tony up with a job.

"Looks like you're doing pretty well as an influencer in Silverlight City. You've got quite the network," I complimented her.

Anna's eyes lit up, and she smiled sweetly. "Oh, I can't compare to you, Ms. Johnson. I've read some of your articles. You're pretty famous in the Silverlight City media scene as a former prosecutor and now a chief editor. Compared to you, I'm just a small-time streamer who knows a few small companies. It was just luck that Tony got hired after I sent his resume over. If you could introduce Tony to the Silverlight City Legal Journal, that would be way better than a small editor job. At least it would sound better."

It seemed like she had done her homework on me and knew about my background. She didn't seem very old but was pretty sharp.

I suggested, "Let's add each other on Facebook first. You can send me Tony's current resume, and I'll see if I can refer him."

Anna thanked me repeatedly and quickly stood up to add me on Facebook.

"Your profile picture is beautiful. Have you been to the Azure Isle Resort?" I complimented her. Anna's Facebook profile picture was a selfie of her in a pink swimsuit, wearing sunglasses, with the Azure Isle Resort hotel in the background, clearly taken intentionally.

Of course, I wouldn't know these details. Zoey had just visited there during her vacation this year and excitedly shared with me how beautiful the scenery was and how excellent the hotel service was. It was one of the top high-end hotels on Azure Isle.

Zoey's mom ran a business out of town and could afford it, but for Anna, with her income, it should be quite difficult to go there.

"I can't afford it. I spent a whole night photoshopping this picture," Anna laughed, embarrassed. "In our line of work, appearance is everything. We have to maintain our image everywhere, or no one will watch our live streams."

When it was time to pay the bill, Anna rushed to pay but was told by the waiter that it had already been paid in advance. Then she said, "Ms. Johnson, you're planning to help us and now you're treating me to this meal. I really feel bad about it. How much was the meal? I must transfer the money to you."

I declined, "No need. You've already helped me a lot."

This wasn't a lie.

After saying goodbye to Anna, I sat in my car for a while, opened the resume she sent me, and checked Tony's personal information.

He was around 30 years old. From his appearance, as Anna said, he did seem steady and reserved, fitting the demeanor of a man at that age.

He was currently working at Digital Leap Technologies Company as a new media copywriter. Yesterday, when Anna was arguing with Tammy, she mentioned that Tony didn't make much money as an editor.

The new media industry as a whole was low-income, limited by its single monetization method, mostly relying on e-commerce ads for revenue. The employees' salaries were naturally very little. Even if one became a chief editor, the income was still average.

I knew one of the investors at this company, Carol Lewis. She'd visited our office before to talk about some collaborations, and I was the one who met with her. She left a great impression on me-decisive and efficient. We discussed the collaboration in the morning, and by the afternoon, it was pretty much a done deal.

If I went straight to the company to ask Tony about what went down at the True Love Entertainment Club that night, he probably wouldn't spill the beans. I needed to get a basic understanding of him first. The best way to do that was to dig into the company.

I called Carol right away and told her that the case I was working on involved one of her company's employees. She was super straightforward and gave me the company's info and the contact details of the person in charge. She said she'd contact them immediately and that I could head over at 2 PM.

I glanced at the time; it was just after 1 PM. I checked the location of Digital Leap Technologies Company, which was about half an hour away from Jazz Age Restaurant, in the northern part of Silverlight City.

I opened the detailed info Carol sent me about the company and skimmed through it. It had about 300 employees, making it a medium-sized enterprise. For an internet company in Silverlight City, it was a decent size. But its business scope didn't seem to match Anna's description of a new media company. It included MCN, e-commerce, and various projects in the gaming industry.

Anna's description of the company seemed way off. It was impressive that a small new media company could have such a large presence, and that she, a relatively unknown home-based streamer, could get involved with them. It seemed this girl was not as simple as she appeared.

Anyway, Anna had little to do with the case itself. As for her and Tony's matters, they were just family issues, not my concern. I drove straight to Digital Leap Technologies Company.

When I got to the building, a senior executive greeted me personally. Judging by the employee badge around his neck, he was the company's Chief Operating Officer. I thought Carol was really giving me a lot of respect, sending a senior exec to meet me.

He was very polite and took me to the café on the ground floor of the company. After some small talk, we got straight to business.

He asked, "Ms. Lewis called me at noon, saying you wanted to know specific information about a company employee. Ms. Johnson, who would you like to know about, and what position do they hold?"

"I want to know about Tony Thompson. He's supposed to be a new media copywriter at your company," I said.

He frowned, like he'd never heard the name before, and smiled apologetically. "It's a basic execution position. We have a lot of employees, and our business interactions usually start at the middle management level. Let me check with the relevant department."

He made a phone call and said, "Hello? Is this James Robinson... Could you come to the café... There's something we need to discuss and resolve quickly."

In no time, James came rushing out of the elevator, looking disheveled with dark circles under his eyes, clearly from frequent overtime and lack of sleep.

Seeing him, the senior executive asked, "James, do you have someone named Tony Thompson in your department?"

"Tony Thompson?" James paused, a hint of disdain and amusement flashing in his eyes before quickly hiding it. He replied, "Yes, but he has already left the company."

###chapter 21 He Resigned

When I heard Tony had quit, my first thought was that he might be running from something, but that didn't make sense. There was no evidence linking him to anything, and I had just been at Tammy's place yesterday, so it couldn't have escalated that fast.

The exec asked, "When did he quit?"

James thought for a second, then looked at the exec and said, "It's been a while, like end of April, so about six months ago."

That was a pretty long time ago, so it seemed like his quitting had nothing to do with the case. But since I couldn't talk to Tony directly and I was already at his company, I figured his old coworkers might spill more than he would. Plus, James seemed a bit on edge around the exec. Asking too much in front of him might not get me anywhere.

I asked, "What kind of guy is Tony? What did he usually do around here? Can you fill me in?"

James said, "His job was pretty basic: handling company documents, maintaining the website, writing posts, stuff like that. It was a mixed bag, really."

"Yeah, our company's pretty open about promotions. If you bring value, the sky's the limit," the exec added.

The vibe was a bit off. Carol had only told them I was here to find someone, not why, so they probably thought I was here to blame someone. If I kept pushing, I might just get useless info.

"Don't worry. I asked Carol to help me look into Tony. I don't know him personally and have no business with him," I said with a smile, trying to ease the tension. "I just want to know what Tony was like at the company, so the more details, the better. Thanks for your help."

I thought for a moment. Since James was Tony's direct boss, there was no need for the exec to stick around. Plus, James might open up more if the exec wasn't there. After some polite chit-chat, the exec said he had something to do, told James to make sure I got satisfactory answers, and left.

"Mr. Robinson, now that the exec's gone, can you give me the full scoop?" I said, then called the waiter and ordered us some coffee.

"Oh, no need to be so formal. The exec told me to be straight with you," James said, looking around nervously. He made sure no one was nearby, then lowered his voice and asked, "Do you have any connection to him?"

"No, I'm friends with Carol, your company's investor. She got the exec to help me out," I said calmly, dropping Carol's name. After years in the business world, I deeply understood that without sufficient clout, merely asking questions wouldn't yield much. They wouldn't go out of their way for nothing.

Sure enough, James's attitude shifted. It was better to get in good with an investor than an exec. He said, "I know Tony well. He was under my supervision. I saw him every day and got weekly reports from him."

"What kind of guy is he? How did he do at the company?" I asked directly, seeing that James was ready to talk.

James replied, "Well, Tony was a bit of an oddball. He was really refined, didn't talk much, loved to read, and spoke like he was straight out of a classic novel. He was in his thirties, had no real ambition, and spent his days writing poems. Honestly, he seemed more like an editor for an old-school magazine than someone in the internet industry. Sometimes I wanted to tell him to switch careers. This job is fine for recent grads as a stepping stone, but not for the long haul."

When the waiter brought the coffee, James quickly stood up, paid with his work card, handed me a cup, and continued, "Work-wise, he wasn't super motivated, but he wasn't slacking off either. He got his tasks done on time but never went the extra mile. He hated working overtime, which is rare in this industry. His attendance was so-so; he was often late, so his performance score was low. If it were anyone else, I would've fired him ages ago."

"Anyone else? Did he have some special status?" I asked, remembering Anna had mentioned she recommended Tony for the job.

"Well..." James scratched his head, giving a knowing smile, and said hesitantly, "He... had some connections to get this job."

I said, "I also want to know more about Tony. If you help me out, I'll make sure to mention it to Carol. You can count on that."

This was about verifying what Anna had told me earlier. I needed to clear this up; otherwise, everything from Tammy, Anna, and the unseen Tony would be questionable.

"No need. I'll tell you everything straight." James smiled, thinking that all his hard work didn't compare to a few good words in front of an investor.

"Is it Anna?" I asked.

"You know about it." James's eyes lit up, and he gave a knowing smile. "Everyone privately calls Tony a cuckold, a man living off his wife's income."

"What do you mean?" I was puzzled.

James explained, "Well, his wife Anna is a signed streamer for our company. She's pretty, but her streaming income is average. It's rumored she's the mistress of a company shareholder. Even though she's married, the relationship supposedly continues. We didn't originally have a position for a new media editor in our content marketing department. It's said that Anna recommended him."

"Does Tony know?" I asked. For a man, this kind of thing was a matter of dignity.

James replied, "He probably doesn't. We never mentioned it in front of him, and he seems very devoted to Anna, reportedly handing over his entire salary every month, though it's not much."

I nodded and continued, "What was the reason for his resignation? You mentioned earlier that he had family issues. Did he specify?"

I needed to find out whether the family issues were related to the case.

James smiled awkwardly. "Family issues weren't the reason for his resignation. With the executive here earlier, I couldn't go into detail. It was an unexpected incident in our department."

"What happened?" I asked, raising my eyebrows. It seemed James really tailored his words to his audience. If I had just asked casually and left, this trip would have been in vain.

James looked a bit embarrassed and rubbed his hands together.

I reassured him, "It's okay. Go ahead. I don't know your executive, and I won't mention this to Carol. Besides, it seems the issue has already been resolved, right?"

James replied, "Alright. Tony got into a fight with someone at the company."

###chapter 22 Tony Knows Lally

I was floored. "Tony got into a fight at work?"

Both James and Anna always described Tony as the calm, easygoing type. How did he end up brawling at the office?

"Yeah, it's weird, right?" James took a sip of his coffee and went on, "It sounds crazy, but it's true. This happened around mid-April, just a few days before Tony quit. Some guy stormed into the office, accusing Tony of sleeping with his girlfriend, and started swinging at him right at his desk. At first, I thought it was a mix-up. I mean, Tony's such a straight-laced guy, always so good to his wife. It didn't add up."

As I stirred my coffee, I said, "Yeah, that's your take, but people can surprise you."

James nodded, "You're right. That day, Tony was acting totally out of character, or maybe his primal instincts kicked in. The guy grabbed a glass and smashed it over Tony's head, blood everywhere. I thought Tony would duck, but no, he fought back. Usually so chill, he just went for it. When I heard the ruckus, I ran out of my office. The guy was already on the floor, and Tony's face was a bloody mess. He looked at me with this wild, almost animalistic stare. Honestly, it freaked me out."

Tony was usually so low-key and reserved, but that didn't mean he didn't have a lot going on inside. From what James said, Tony liked reading and writing poetry, which hinted at a rich inner life. It reminded me of Alan and made my heart ache a bit...

But the idea of Tony having an affair? No way. It wasn't about trusting him; from what Tammy and Anna said, he seemed to be suffering from impotence.

I wasn't sure if this was connected to the case.

"So, how did it all get sorted out? Do you know the name of the guy who attacked Tony?" I asked.

James shook his head, "I don't know. It all happened so fast. The guy was skinny, got up, and bolted. Tony went to a nearby hospital for a quick bandage and then came back to work. Given the department's situation, I didn't want to stir things up, so I told everyone to keep quiet about it."

He looked a bit embarrassed, then added, "I don't know the guy's name, but I heard from some colleagues that he mentioned his girlfriend's name a few times. It was... Lally Rodriguez."

I was stunned. Lally! The witness who appeared during the trial a few days ago! She actually knew Tony! It turned out there was indeed a connection between these people!

I shivered and asked again, "Are you sure? Really Lally Rodriguez?"

"Yes, absolutely!" James confirmed, "I remember now. The guy had 'Lally' tattooed on the back of his hand! It stuck with me because it's rare to see someone with another person's name tattooed. He seemed like a street thug."

So, there was definitely a connection between Tammy, Tony, and Lally. Only Tom was left, and while there wasn't solid proof yet, following these clues would surely lead somewhere!

I felt a wave of certainty wash over me. Looking at James's shifty, somewhat guilty eyes, I suddenly got it. "So, Tony didn't really resign, did he? You fired him. You were scared that guy would come back and cause more trouble, and you didn't want this mess to blow up and risk your job, so you canned Tony, right?"

James shook his head, waving his hands frantically. "No, no, that's not it. I did think about it, but before I could say anything, Tony came to me and quit."

"Really?" I raised an eyebrow.

"Absolutely. And what he said when he resigned made me realize he always knew about his wife," James said, still in disbelief.

"What did he say?" I pressed.

Tony had known for a while that he got his job because his wife was someone's mistress, yet he had put up with it for so long. Was he just spineless, or was he playing a deeper game?

My curiosity about him was growing. His connection with Lally suggested that on the night of the Entertainment Club incident, he was more than just a bystander; he might have been directly involved.

James tried to recall Tony's words from that day. "He was very calm, like always, sitting in my office talking about Anna. He said he always knew about it and appreciated that his colleagues never brought it up, protecting his dignity. But the fight had caused a lot of trouble for the company, and there was a chance the guy might come back. After thinking it over, he decided to leave. He also asked if people could stop talking about Anna, saying it wasn't her fault."

That sounded like the Tony everyone described-rational, almost too rational. Saying it wasn't Anna's fault-either he really loved her that much, or his own insecurities had twisted him. I wasn't buying it. He seemed pretty worked up about Lally; otherwise, he wouldn't have hit that guy so hard.

"Do you know where he went after he left?" I asked.

James shook his head, looking sincere.

"What about his phone number?" I continued.

"I have it. I'll send it to you right away." James replied, pulling out his phone and calling HR for Tony's contact info.

Finding Tony wouldn't be hard; I could just go to his house. But what he said might not be the truth. If he and Tammy were in on this together, they could spin new lies, and I might not catch on.

Soon, Tony's number was sent to me, but when I called, it was disconnected. Looked like he had changed his number.

This cut off the direct way to find Tony. In a big city like Silverlight City, if I wanted to track him down, I'd have to start with Lally. She'd definitely know where he was.

After thanking James and exchanging contact info, I left Digital Leap Technologies and called Carol, telling her the issue was resolved. I initially wanted to ask about Anna and the company's shareholder, but then I decided against it. It wasn't really related to the case. Tony was already suspicious enough, so no need to dig deeper into their personal drama.

The urgent task now was to find Lally.

Looked like I had to head back to the Entertainment Club.

###chapter 23 Seeking Help from an Old Classmate

After getting home, I realized I had another problem: how the heck was I gonna find Lally?

Just waltzing in there was a no-go. This Entertainment Club was officially shut down but secretly running a prostitution ring.

It would've been easier if I were a guy, but as a woman, there was no way I could get in. And even if I did, I wouldn't know what to say.

Going in directly would definitely put them on high alert. But I also had no clue how to create a fake identity. Undercover work wasn't my thing. Over the years, as a journalist or prosecutor, I'd always gone in headfirst without hiding who I was.

After mulling it over, I decided to call a buddy in the police department's criminal investigation team. I had some dirt on the Entertainment Club that I could share with them, hoping it might lead to something new.

I scrolled through my phone contacts and stopped at Benjamin Wright's name.

Benjamin was the deputy captain of the criminal investigation team at the Silverlight City Police Department. Back in college, Silverlight University Law School and Silverlight Police University had this internship exchange program.

He had a thing for Cindy Hernandez from our dorm back then. They barely spoke, but he once went to our dorm and sang a love confession with a hoarse voice and mediocre guitar skills, surrounded by candles. Cindy was freaked out, but his name became legendary at the law school.

He then switched tactics, deciding to get close to Cindy through her friends. That was how I met Benjamin. With his shamelessness, sharp eyes, and social skills, he used what he learned in criminal investigation classes to woo Cindy. He found out all about Cindy's interests, frequently invited her to meals, movies, and outings, and was always attentive and patient. After two years of persistence, he finally won Cindy's heart.

A few years ago, when he got married, Alan and I attended the wedding.

After hearing about Benjamin's wild stories, even the usually composed Alan couldn't help but laugh and said, "With that kind of determination, he's perfect for criminal investigation."

And indeed, that was true.

Benjamin was usually laid-back, but he had a knack for criminal investigation, acing all his subjects. He graduated in 2013, and in just ten years, he solved several major cases in the city, quickly rising from a district cop to the deputy captain of the city's criminal investigation team.

When I was at the prosecutor's office, I worked with him on several job-related crime cases, but we hadn't kept in touch much lately.

I dialed his number, and after a few rings, he picked up. From the background noise, it sounded like he was still in a meeting and had stepped out to take the call. He said, "Mrs. Smith, what's up? The prosecutor's office actually called me? Our captain's in a meeting, but I rushed out to take your call!"

We hadn't seen each other in years, but he was still the same. Memories of our college days came flooding back, and I felt a warmth in my heart.

Then it occurred to me that with such a major case like the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder, how could a deputy captain of the criminal police squad not know about it? 

Perhaps he had been too busy lately, or maybe he wasn't handling this case and hadn't been paying attention. After all, he didn't even know that I had left the prosecutor's office. 

He was indeed as careless as ever; he hadn't changed a bit over the years. When I saw Cindy last year, she complained that he only cared about cases and didn't think about anything else.

I didn't know where to start, so I simply said it was for work and needed his help. He readily agreed to meet at a barbecue joint near the police department at 7 PM.

I glanced at the time. It was almost five o'clock when I got home from Digital Leap Technologies Company. Now it was around six ten, just the right time to head over and wait for him.

When I pulled up to the barbecue joint, Benjamin was already hanging around the entrance, looking around.

In his thirties, he hadn't put on any weight and was still lean, but he had grown a beard, and his short hair had turned long, looking like it hadn't been cut in a while. He was shivering in the cold wind, wrapped in a leather jacket.

I parked the car and greeted him, "Long time no see, Benjamin. Why aren't you inside? It's freezing out here."

Benjamin replied, "Mrs. Smith, long time no see. I've missed you... I don't have any money, and I'll be nervous if I go in! You know Cindy controls the money tightly. If I go in first, order food, and can't pay, what then?"

Classic Benjamin. I was speechless and quickly invited him inside. Then I briefly explained the past few years and the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case.

"What? You left the prosecutor's office? If you're the editor-in-chief at Silverlight City Legal Journal now, then that article criticizing our team's case handling must be written by you, right? The victim in the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case was... Alan?" Benjamin asked, looking at me in disbelief. His carefree demeanor vanished, and he fell silent, smoking a cigarette, lost in thought. The smoke swirled around, and the smell of nicotine filled the air.

"Nancy, I... I'm sorry. I've been really busy lately..." Benjamin hesitated, not knowing what to say.

"It's okay. I've adjusted over the past few days," I said.

"I have heard it. The trial was postponed, and the defense is said to be very strong." Benjamin put out his cigarette, took a sip of his drink, and rubbed his face, saying, "This case is strange. It indeed requires special handling, but the whole process is unusually tight. Colleagues say even the evidence was rushed, as if someone wants to close the case quickly."

I nodded. "I'm investigating this case."

"You think there's something fishy?" Benjamin asked, his eyes lighting up. When it came to cases, his professionalism was undeniable.

"Yes, there's an issue with the witness testimony. I've found some clues and need to investigate a witness." I replied, then briefly explained Lally's situation and expressed my desire to contact Lally at the Entertainment Club. I mentioned I couldn't get in due to my identity and asked if he had any ideas.

Benjamin's expression turned strange and he said, "True Love Entertainment Club again..."

I asked, "Are you guys investigating it too?"

"Yes." Benjamin nodded, thinking while saying slowly, "There have been some clues about prostitution in the past two years, but the police have investigated several times without finding evidence. Someone might be protecting them, but without catching them in the act, no evidence, and no financial loopholes, the case remains unresolved. However, we're currently investigating a drug trafficking case, and the suspect frequently visits this Entertainment Club."

Benjamin briefly explained the situation. It wasn't a major case, but the suspect was caught at the Entertainment Club. The manager of the club reported it, and the club's security caught the suspect. As a result, the Entertainment Club not only did nothing wrong but also showed good behavior. Benjamin suspected the club cut off this lead to protect the criminal group behind it.

It seemed the True Love Entertainment Club was a mess, involved in prostitution, arson, murder, and now drug trafficking. I wondered who was behind this club with such power.

At the same time, Benjamin revealed an even more astonishing piece of news, "The Entertainment Club will officially reopen the day after tomorrow."

###chapter 24 Preparations

I was super curious. I mean, there was this huge arson and murder case at the Entertainment Club, and the place was even sealed off. How did it manage to get back to business in just a few days?

Benjamin explained, "The Entertainment Club sued Laura the day after the incident, accusing her of trashing the club, committing murder on the premises, and ruining the club's rep, among other things. They kicked off a civil lawsuit to clear their name. Their legal team is top-notch, and the court sided with them. Then, the legal team went to the cops, saying they were victims too and were fully cooperating with the investigation. They promised to keep the crime scene on the fourth floor untouched and sealed off, while the other floors would run as usual. So, there's nothing we can do."

Benjamin shrugged and rolled his eyes. He muttered, "I guess the chief got a call from higher-ups, saying the economy's been rough these past few years, and we need to keep things stable and protect jobs. So, that's why the club could reopen so quickly."

As for the investigation of Lally, Benjamin had a plan, "The drug trafficking case is almost wrapped up, and it'll be closed soon. In a couple of days, the criminal investigation team will take the suspects to the scene for a reenactment. You can tag along as a journalist. During the on-site investigation, I'll call Lally over. Once you see her, you can ask and investigate, but you can't take too long."

I agreed and said, "Thanks. I'll bring my apprentice Zoey with me that day. Afterward, I'll write a column for the law journal as a thank you."

Before leaving, I asked, "How many managers does the club have? Is the manager who didn't show up in court the same person who called the cops?"

Benjamin looked surprised and said, "The Entertainment Club has only one manager, whom I've met. His last name is Lopez, and he's a real piece of work. He seems cooperative and honest, but he's actually very shrewd and tough to deal with. He'll be the one meeting us at the club the day after tomorrow."

It seemed I needed to keep an eye on this guy when we visited the club.

It was already super late when I got home. As I lay on the couch to rest, I got a message from Anna on Facebook: [Hey, Ms. Johnson, this is Anna. Is it a good time to call?]

What could she want with me this late? Could it be that Anna found out about my visit to Digital Leap Technologies Company earlier today? 

Given the fact that James mentioned Anna being a mistress, this girl was certainly not simple.

I called Anna and asked, "Hey, Anna, what's up?"

Anna replied, "Ms. Johnson, I'm really sorry to bother you so late. I just finished work and remembered you were looking into the Sand Village demolition case. About the interview regarding Tony's injury, when would be a good time for you?"

How did I not think of this earlier? Using the Sand Village demolition case investigation to get close to Tony, I could also subtly ask about the arson and murder case at the Entertainment Club. 

I felt a surge of energy and said, "I was just about to mention that. I plan to go to the office tomorrow to review some materials on the Sand Village demolition case and set up the follow-up interview. By the way, is Tony home now? How about I talk to him over the phone right now?"

Anna replied, "That's great. Thanks, Ms. Johnson. But Tony said he's working late today and hasn't come home yet. I'll let him know when he gets back. Is that okay?"

Anna had no clue about Tony's resignation. It seemed James was keeping that info on lockdown. As long as Tony didn't spill the beans to Anna, no one higher up in the company would catch wind of it.

James seemed pretty straightforward about Tony's situation today. After all, he must have some serious skills to climb to a mid-level position in a company with hundreds of employees. He was banking on Tony keeping quiet, and the higher-ups wouldn't ask because of this unspoken understanding. He was handling everything smoothly as the middleman.

I sighed inwardly. From both professional and personal perspectives, Tony had mostly played the role of a victim. Could someone like him really be connected to this murder case?

The next morning, I got up early, got ready, and headed to the office.

Because of Alan's case, Howard gave me two months off with triple pay, which I was super grateful for.

Since I had an appointment with Benjamin to visit True Love Entertainment Club and meet Lally tomorrow, going to Sand Village today would be pointless since I wouldn't find Tony. Telling Anna about Tony's resignation in person might tip him off and lead to unwanted consequences.

In other words, today was basically free.

I wanted to stay busy, especially now. I didn't want to go home to an empty house or sit around letting my thoughts spiral. Keeping busy would help me quickly resolve the case and give both Alan and myself some closure.

Anna messaged me on Facebook, saying Tony was swamped with work and couldn't take time off. She asked if we could postpone for a couple of days. I agreed, figuring I could use today to check some related materials at the office.

I had a hunch he sensed something and was deliberately avoiding me.

According to Anna, he still went home every day, just a bit late recently, and there was nothing unusual in his tone. But I was sure that even if Anna didn't mention my investigation, Tammy would have told him. Yet, he was still holding his ground, calm and composed, doing everything as usual.

Although I hadn't met him in person, I was getting more and more curious about him. To outsiders, he seemed cowardly, weak, and incompetent, but I felt he was not simple. What kind of force had sustained him to keep going? Love, hatred, or something else?

When I arrived at the office, everyone was already at their desks working. They were surprised to see me but quickly went back to normal, nodding in greeting and then getting back to their tasks. It seemed Howard had briefed them in advance.

In fact, my interactions with colleagues were usually limited to work, with no personal connections. Maybe because of my efficient and decisive work style, they rarely engaged in small talk with me.

Of course, Zoey, who sat next to my office, was different.

Shortly after I sat down, she came in with coffee, knocked on the door, then closed it, and ran over, blinking her eyes, saying, "Nancy, I got you some freshly brewed coffee from downstairs. You usually like iced Americano, but since it's cold, I thought a hot latte would be better. Drink something warm."

Zoey was a senior intern, smart and considerate. She had been messaging me on Facebook these days, asking if I had eaten and slept well, and telling me not to be annoyed by her messages.

If it were anyone else sending me these messages at this time, I would be very annoyed. But Zoey was different. I knew she was worried I might have dark thoughts being alone, and even at the risk of annoying me, she kept checking on me.

I took a sip of the coffee and said, "Zoey, bring over the materials on the Sand Village demolition case from the past few years. We'll review them. And tomorrow, you'll come with me to True Love Entertainment Club for an interview. You'll write the article."

###chapter 25 The Insurance Policy

"Mrs. Smith, do you think I can handle this?" Zoey asked, a bit unsure.

"Of course you can! You've already written the previous articles. The chief editor just tweaked them a bit and published them under their name," I tried to encourage her.

It was pretty rare for a senior college student to get a byline during a newspaper internship. Usually, the internship was too short, and they didn't have enough experience. But getting a byline in a city legal publication? That was a big deal for graduation awards or job hunting.

Zoey might be young, but she was solid and experienced in her work. She never seemed nervous, always applying her professional knowledge actively. She was super smart, had great writing skills, and a sharp insight that even beat some folks who'd been working for two or three years.

Seeing Zoey's hesitation, I smiled and said, "Don't just stand there, bring me the materials on the Sand Village demolition brawl case."

Zoey nodded and quickly came back with the materials from the case room.

"Mrs. Smith, is the case we're covering at True Love Entertainment Club tomorrow related to Alan?" Zoey asked cautiously after a moment of hesitation, as I flipped through the materials.

"Sort of. I'm heading to the Entertainment Club to check out a witness from the trial. I think their testimony is fishy, but I need a good reason to go there. A friend from the detective squad is also going to the club to have a suspect identify the scene. I'll tag along as a reporter and, in return, write a special report on their operation. You'll write it," I explained.

As I flipped through the materials, I suddenly thought of something and asked, "You were at the trial that day. What did you think about the witnesses' testimonies?"

Zoey thought seriously and said, "At first, I didn't notice anything, but after listening to the defense attorney, it seemed like the three witnesses were too focused on the victim. That's all."

I nodded in agreement.

Most of the media there seemed to be just for the drama, focusing on the sensational stuff. It was Zoey's first time at a trial, so it was natural for her to take some time to get familiar. But being able to pick up on these issues in the testimony was already impressive, especially for an intern.

"The three witnesses are Tammy, a cleaner at the Entertainment Club; Lally, a server at the club; and Tom, a member of the club. After the trial, I went to Tammy's home in Sand Village to investigate as the chief reporter of the Silverlight City Legal Journal."

I put down the materials and handed Zoey a voice recorder, saying, "Listen to my interview with Tammy and see if you notice anything."

Zoey put down the materials, put on the headphones, and listened. After just one time, she immediately said, "Mrs. Smith, Tammy's testimony is exactly the same. She must have memorized it!"

"Exactly." I nodded and continued, "Tammy's second son is named Tony, and his wife is named Anna. After the interview, I gave Anna my business card and found out that on the night of the incident, Tony gave Tammy a ride on his motorcycle and stayed at the Entertainment Club for a long time. I suspect he's involved in this case."

I added, "When I first went to Tammy's house, she thought I was there to interview about the Sand Village demolition brawl. Then I found out that Tony, as a victim in that incident, didn't get the compensation he deserved."

I detailed to Zoey about Tony's disability, his work situation, his relationship with his wife, his connection with Lally, and other findings from my investigation over the past few days.

"So that's why you're digging into the Sand Village demolition case materials?" Lally suddenly realized. She pieced together the clues I gave her and thought for a moment, "I'll focus on finding stuff related to Tony. Mrs. Smith, do you think he could have a split personality like in the movies?"

I shook my head and said, "Unlikely. Let's not worry about that now. We'll work separately and focus on finding materials related to Tony."

Split personality was a type of schizophrenia, often accompanied by unexpected behaviors. But Tony seemed more like someone who bided his time and waited for the right moment. It suggested he had a bigger goal with such patience.

At that time, I hadn't officially joined the company yet, and all the materials related to the Sand Village demolition brawl case were in paper form-a thick stack of documents.

It was tedious to go through them page by page, word by word. We worked from morning until past 1 PM and still hadn't found any information on Tony.

Just as we were about to take a break for lunch, a photocopy on top of one of the stacks caught my attention. The text and format were completely different from the other materials. I picked it up and saw it was an accident insurance policy from an overseas insurance company. The beneficiary was Tammy Martinez, and the insurance amount was a staggering $2 million!

What shocked me even more was that the insured person was Tony Thompson, and the policyholders were listed as Zack Garcia and Tony Thompson, with amounts of $1.5 million and $500,000 respectively, dated August 2020.

"Zoey, when did the Sand Village demolition brawl happen? Has there been any other incident in recent years?" I immediately asked.

"December 2019, and nothing since then," Zoey replied.

Something was off. According to Anna, Zack and Tony hadn't been in contact since the Sand Village demolition incident, and Zack hadn't returned home, suggesting a falling out between the brothers.

But the demolition incident happened in 2019, and in 2020 they jointly took out an insurance policy for Tammy, indicating they had been in contact all along.

I quickly searched through the stack of materials and soon found the list of claimants. The first name on the list was Tony Thompson, with the injury described as testicular rupture leading to atrophy and necrosis, resulting in loss of fertility, and a compensation amount of $500,000. The document was signed by the real estate developer's representative, Zack Garcia.

It made sense. After the incident, the two brothers had maintained contact, but Anna was unaware.

At the same time, Tony's compensation was quite substantial, indicating that Zack had made significant efforts in securing the compensation. And Zack had fulfilled his brotherly duty.

It was likely that Tony used his compensation money to take out a policy for their mother Tammy to have the insurance policy a year later, with Zack's contribution. Tony didn't keep any of the money for himself.

So, why did Tony list himself as the insured? What kind of accident did he foresee that would lead him to take out such a large insurance policy for his mother?

Ordinary families might buy a few thousand dollars' worth of accident insurance, but Tony bought insurance worth several hundred thousand dollars.

Even though he was a victim, the compensation he received was enough for him to live comfortably in Silverlight City.

There was only one possibility: he knew an accident was inevitable.

I had a hunch that Tony's involvement in this case was far more complex than just being a witness.

###chapter 26 Heating

Benjamin shot me a message in the evening: [We gotta hit up the Entertainment Club at 1 PM tomorrow for an on-site inspection.]

When I got back, I wanted to chat more with Anna to get a better grip on the situation. But then I thought, grilling her too much about her relationship with Tony might make him suspicious. For now, it was best to play it cool.

One thing was for sure, though-Tony had a hunch something was gonna go down four years ago. He took out a big insurance policy so if anything happened to him, his mom Tammy would be set for life.

But whether this tied into the arson and murder at the Entertainment Club? That was just a wild guess. I got no solid proof.

Right now, the big thing was figuring out the deal between Tony and Lally, and how Tammy fitted into all this. Why did Tammy and Lally lie in court to frame Laura?

But honestly, that was not my biggest worry.

The weekend was approaching again. I was supposed to head back last week, but I got caught up investigating after Alan's incident and found an excuse not to go. This Saturday, no matter what, I gotta go home. How should I explain to my dad why Alan didn't come with me?

Once or twice was fine, but over time, he would eventually find out. How was I supposed to explain this to my dad?

I drifted off and dreamed about ten years ago.

I was walking alone on Laurel Street, where Alan and I used to hang out in college. There was the BBQ joint, the coffee shop, and the Mexican place Alan loved. I called out Alan's name, but no one answered.

Suddenly, I was back in the present, in a heavy snowstorm. Silverlight City had changed so much, with tall buildings and endless lights. On the street where Alan had his accident, I broke down, crying my heart out. It felt like my mom was there, gently patting my back like she did when I was a kid, "Nancy, don't be scared. This too shall pass."

"Mom, Alan..." I called out their names. In a flash, I was at the bottom of a well, unable to climb out. The floodwater surged in from the well's opening, chilling me to the bone. I could barely breathe, like I was suffocating. Facing despair and loneliness, I slowly closed my eyes. It was over; I was so tired of holding on.

I didn't know how much time passed, but suddenly I heard the most familiar voice from the past decades, "Sleep a bit more, Nancy. It's still early."

I jolted awake on the couch, gasping for air, looking around for familiar faces.

It was eight in the morning. The bedroom and study doors were shut tight. Memories of recent times rushed back-it was just a dream.

People were most vulnerable and sensitive when they first woke up. But ever since Alan's incident, I forced myself every morning to sift through the info I had and focus on the case.

My face was wet. Was the ceiling leaking? I looked up; no cracks. I looked down at the pillow on the couch, already soaked. I touched my face.

I had cried in my dream.

The living room wasn't as cold this morning. I thought the temperature had gone up, but when I checked my phone, it showed 41 degrees Fahrenheit. Silverlight City had started heating today, and there was a reminder to dress warmly.

I touched the radiator in the living room; it was definitely heating up. I remembered my dad reminding me to pay the heating bill a few days ago. He must have checked the payment app and reminded me. I told him I was too busy and had forgotten. It seemed he had already paid it for me.

Parents in this world were always thinking about their children. Although I didn't have children myself, as I grew older, I gradually came to understand my parents' good intentions.

It turned out I was not alone; I had my father, friends, and a very congenial apprentice.

The doorbell rang, and I remembered I had an appointment with Zoey to meet at my place at 8:30 AM so we could head to the police station together.

I opened the door, and there was Zoey, wearing a thick white camel hair coat, holding a big package in one hand and breakfast in the other, smiling at me.

In her more than six months of internship, she had visibly matured. On her first day at the company, she had short hair, wore trendy streetwear, denim shorts, and sneakers, full of youthful energy.

Six months later, Zoey had grown her hair out and dressed more elegantly. Howard joked that she was becoming another Nancy, with a similar temperament, style, and even fashion sense.

Looking at the apprentice I had mentored, or rather, my little sister, I felt a warmth in my heart and quickly let her in. "Zoey, you look beautiful today."

"Mrs. Smith, you look even better today! Keep it up!" Zoey replied with a grin.

This was our unique way of greeting each other every morning. Zoey had suggested it, saying that "Good morning" was too old-fashioned. She insisted I say, "Zoey, you look beautiful today," and she would reply, "Mrs. Smith, you look even better today."

Material things could not bestow the true meaning of life. It was always the small, unnoticed places where seeds were sown, like wildflowers growing by the roadside or a green plant in the desert, that brought some vitality to a harsh and unforgiving life.

Zoey wasn't visiting my home for the first time. She saw the bedding on the living room couch, glanced at the closed bedroom and study doors, and noticed my slightly swollen eyes. She quickly understood, her eyes showing a hint of sadness, and her eyes reddened. Without saying anything, she cheerfully took out the large package she had brought.

"Mrs. Smith, winter is coming. My mom brought me two blankets from abroad a few days ago."

She pulled out a thick, colorful blanket from the package and handed it to me, making a funny face. "Two blankets would be too hot. I'm giving you one to keep you warm in the winter."

Before I could refuse, she turned and went to the kitchen, wiping her tears as she took out two sets of utensils from the cabinet and served breakfast. She put half a spoon of sugar in my bowl. I like half a spoon of sugar in my milk, and Zoey knew that.

When Alan was around, she often came over for meals on weekends and sometimes stayed over.

For some reason, my eyes welled up with tears.

"Mrs. Smith, hurry up and eat. Look at you, it's just breakfast, no need to get so emotional." Zoey was smiling as she broke the bread for me, but tears were streaming down her face.

People needed to rest, and emotions needed to rest too. In the presence of someone they trusted, they didn't have to be overly strong. They could confide, seek comfort, and take a temporary truce with life or fate.

Zoey said, "Mrs. Smith, don't be sad. I'll always be with you. Alan wouldn't want you to be sad either..." As she spoke, she couldn't hold back her own tears and started crying.

Later, when I recalled this morning, I couldn't remember if I had cried, but I clearly remembered gently patting Zoey's back, just like my mother used to do for me, and whispering, "Zoey, don't be afraid. It will all pass."

###chapter 27 Master and Apprentice

Around 11, Benjamin called and said we could head to the police station.

I drove with Zoey, and in less than half an hour, we pulled up at the city police station. Two police cars were parked out front, ready to roll. Benjamin was already there, chatting and laughing with a young officer who looked fresh out of the academy.

"Over here, Nancy!" Benjamin called out, giving the young officer a friendly pat. "Meet my apprentice, Ruben Adams."

Ruben was a bit taller than Benjamin, probably over 6 feet. He had a youthful face and looked about the same age as Zoey. 

He wasn't shy at all and grinned as he introduced himself, "Hey, Mrs. Smith, just call me Ruben. I've heard a lot about you from Mr. and Mrs. Wright. You're amazing-a genius from Silverlight University Law School, an expert at the District Attorney's office, and the editor-in-chief of the Silverlight City Legal Journal. That's incredible! Can you share some of your secrets with me?"

Even though he was talking to me, his eyes kept darting over to Zoey.

Yep, the saying "like master, like apprentice" was spot on. This guy was a spitting image of Benjamin back in his college days when he was chasing Cindy.

"You're too kind. I'm not as great as he says. But if Benjamin is mentoring you, you must have been an outstanding student at the police academy. Let's exchange ideas more often." I smiled and glanced at Benjamin.

"Ruben, you rascal, don't embarrass me out here! Nancy, and this young lady, I apologize. He's been here for less than a year and doesn't know the manners. I'll deal with him later."

Benjamin blushed, looking embarrassed, knowing I was hinting at something. He patted Ruben's head and smiled apologetically at Zoey, "We detectives are a rough bunch. Please don't mind. But let's get to know each other. I'm Benjamin Wright, a... college mate of Nancy's."

On the way here, I had introduced Benjamin to Zoey and mentioned his college days chasing Cindy. Zoey widened her eyes and gave a thumbs up, saying, "That kind of perseverance can indeed achieve great things."

"Nice to meet you, Mr. Wright. I'm Zoey Taylor, a senior intern at the Silverlight City Legal Journal. Mrs. Smith brought me along to cover this drug trafficking case. I'll be writing a feature article, so I'll need your help with the information."

Zoey stepped forward confidently and shook hands with Benjamin. Ruben, being smart, also extended his hand, but Zoey naturally returned to my side, leaving his hand hanging awkwardly in the air.

"Sure, let's exchange ideas and learn from each other." Benjamin glared at Ruben, then kicked him lightly, saying, "Learn from Zoey! You always embarrass me. You've ruined my dignity!"

Ruben chuckled awkwardly, checked the time, and changed the subject, "You're right, you're right. Let's get going. We can discuss the case details on the way."

I left my car at the police station, and Zoey and I, with our Silverlight City Legal Journal badges, got into the back seat of the police car. Ruben drove, and Benjamin sat in the front passenger seat.

Once in the car, Zoey took out her iPad and started preparing to take notes. She said, "Mr. Wright, this is my first time covering a drug trafficking case. Since we're all on the same team, I'll get straight to the point. I'd like to understand the situation in advance to prepare and hopefully write the draft tonight to make it for this week's issue. I'll make it the front-page story."

She glanced at me and smiled, "Mrs. Smith also told me to let you review the article before it goes out, just to avoid any misunderstandings."

This was something I had set up beforehand. Reports on police investigation cases like this were rarely shown to the police system before publication. After all, the Silverlight City Legal Journal was not a government agency and didn't have the need for prior approval. However, since Benjamin had helped, and this drug-related case aligned with the recent anti-drug campaign, it wouldn't have hurt to let him take a look to ensure there were no mistakes.

Benjamin, sitting up front, clasped his hands together and said, "Thank you. I trust you 100%! Efficient, diligent, and having an intern write the front-page story-this is exactly what I'd expect from someone trained by Nancy! As for the case details, Ruben handled it himself. I didn't intervene much."

Zoey looked a bit surprised and glanced at Ruben, who was driving. I smiled to myself, knowing Benjamin was proud of his apprentice and was starting to brag a bit.

But Benjamin had a good eye for talent. For someone to handle cases independently within a year at the police station was not typical for a regular police academy graduate.

"Actually, I'm not that impressive..." Ruben began, but then noticed Benjamin's stern look and quickly got serious. "The case itself isn't huge, but it might be connected to the Silverlight City underground drug trafficking network. Over the years, we've only managed to catch small fry, never the big fish. And strangely, these small fry were all caught based on informant tips, with evidence found at their homes. We've never caught anyone in the act."

"We don't know the transaction locations, methods, stock quantities, or key members. This drug network always seems to be in our blind spot," he added.

Ruben kept his eyes on the road, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the steering wheel as he thought deeply.

Benjamin nodded in satisfaction, "Go on."

"There's no such thing as a blind spot, only gaps in our thinking," Ruben said seriously. "If drug trafficking were happening elsewhere, they'd go to great lengths to cover it up. But True Love Entertainment Club was quick to expose this incident. Of course, you could say they have nothing to hide, but running a business is about making money. Shutting down for ten days or more costs a lot. The owner isn't stupid, especially for the city's largest entertainment club."

He continued, "I suspect True Love Entertainment Club is not only the crime scene but also one of the bases for this drug network. Of course, this doesn't need to be in the report. Focus on the case itself. Sorry, I got a bit carried away."

As Ruben spoke, Benjamin turned and grinned at me, as if to say, "How about my apprentice?" He also glanced at Zoey.

"Not bad. You have the same flair as Benjamin. 'Like master, like apprentice' indeed," I said with a smile. 

This young man was indeed impressive. He seemed carefree, but his case analysis was broad and sharp-a promising detective.

"Your reasoning is brilliant, but let's focus on the current case. Now, please provide detailed information related to this report. Our time is valuable, isn't it? Rest assured, I'll do my best to write a great article." Zoey responded politely with a smile.

###chapter 28 Are You an Idiot?

"Alright then." Benjamin gave a sheepish grin. Zoey's words had cut short the master and apprentice duo's performance. From Benjamin's expression, it was clear he wanted Ruben to impress Zoey.

Zoey's usually all smiles, loving Vesperia literature, anime, and movies. But when it came to work, she was laser-focused, tuning out everything else.

Her earlier comment was meant to put Benjamin and Ruben in their place. Zoey couldn't stand their boasting. I had heard Howard mention that Zoey's father was also in the public security system, so she must have been exposed to it from a young age. But I don't usually pry into that stuff.

"The case is pretty straightforward. The crime happened on the night of November 15th. The suspect, Tanner Green, isn't from around here; he's a thug. We got a tip-off, and within minutes, the Entertainment Club called the cops. It was all very mysterious, and the acting was top-notch." Ruben said casually, looking like a seasoned pro.

The case wasn't huge, and they already had the suspect. No need to take him to the scene. The main goal was to check out the Entertainment Club's connection to the case, which was why they made such a big deal out of it.

"Alright, Mr. Adams, just give us the details of the case," Zoey said, not even looking up as she took notes.

"Sure thing!" Ruben replied cheerfully.

I almost burst out laughing, and Benjamin kept shaking his head, looking disappointed. This guy was a bit too cocky. Then he raised his eyebrows, thinking that youth was meant to be wild. After all, he had won Cindy over in a similar way. Feeling proud, he looked at his apprentice with satisfaction.

When Cindy agreed to Benjamin's pursuit, I was curious. Cindy wasn't the type to be easily swayed by emotions, so I asked her about it. Surprisingly, she said that during a holiday, she "accidentally" met Benjamin at the train station.

In the scene where they waved goodbye, she suddenly remembered the TV show "Love Story" and its not-so-brave protagonist, which led her to agree.

But the version I heard was that Benjamin boasted about his excellence to everyone, and his sincerity eventually moved Cindy, who agreed to be with him.

This master-apprentice duo really had a connection.

However, Ruben wasn't as lucky as Benjamin. Although Zoey didn't have a boyfriend, she had mentioned more than once that she liked gentle, sunny, artistic boys. Zoey's ideal boyfriend was completely different from Ruben.

Unaware, Ruben kept trying, "Here's the deal, Ms. Taylor. Our goal this time is, first, to take the suspect to identify the scene and investigate the Entertainment Club for clues. Second, we learned from the suspect's phone chats that there would be a drug deal at the Entertainment Club at noon today. The other party is an addict, and we plan to catch him on the spot and find out who he usually buys drugs from."

"Okay, so is the suspect in the police car behind us?" Zoey asked, glancing at Ruben's uniform in the rearview mirror.

"Of course, I arranged it. Is there a problem?" Ruben was momentarily stunned.

Benjamin, lounging in the passenger seat, suddenly remembered something and turned to glare at Ruben. Ruben got a bit jittery and stammered, "Mr. Wright, don't look at me like that. It's... it's kinda scary, especially while driving."

Benjamin, fuming but with a forced smile, said, "My dear apprentice, please enlighten your unfortunate master on what your plan is this time."

"First, to identify the scene and investigate the Entertainment Club. Second... second, to use the suspect as bait to catch the drug addict and trace the upstream sellers..."Ruben felt a chill run down his spine and started sweating. Zoey and I were already grinning.

"So why did you only tell me about tracing the upstream sellers today?"

"To... to surprise you, you know..."

Benjamin lost it, starting to scold Ruben without caring that Zoey and I were in the car, "Is your brain a single-core processor? You're in a police uniform, driving a police car, making a big scene at the Entertainment Club, and bringing Tanner in handcuffs. Then you expect Tanner to act nonchalant and meet the guy upstairs. Is the guy blind? Or are you an idiot? Turn around and head back to the station immediately!"

"Mr. Wright, the unmarked cars were taken by other teams today."

"Call two rideshare cars yourself, and you pay for them!" Benjamin fumed.

"No need, Mr. Wright. Mrs. Smith can drive. We'll go ourselves. Mr. Adams, just cancel one of the rides," Zoey said.

The car had already gone halfway, so Ruben reluctantly turned around and headed back to the station. They went to the locker room to change into plain clothes. When they came out, Ruben looked deflated, indicating that Benjamin had given him a quick lesson.

Benjamin then solemnly thanked Zoey, admitting his failure in teaching his apprentice. If it weren't for her reminder, the operation might have failed.

We set off again, avoiding too many people to prevent drawing attention. This time, Ruben, Benjamin, and the suspect Tanner took one car, while Zoey and I drove ourselves.

Zoey, sitting in the passenger seat, laughed so hard she got hiccups, "Mrs. Smith, this master-apprentice duo doesn't seem very smart."

I smiled too and said, "Benjamin wanted to show off with his apprentice, but you taught them a lesson. But don't be too harsh; I still need Benjamin's help."

"If it weren't for me, this operation would have failed." Zoey wrinkled her nose and said in an old-fashioned manner, "That guy stared at me like he'd never seen a girl before and bragged about his detective skills in the car. I didn't expect him to make such a rookie mistake. Ruben is still too young."

"I underestimated you. I didn't expect your internship at the Silverlight City Journal to give you such insight into detective work," I teased.

"Mrs. Smith, my dad used to tell me a lot about it..." When she mentioned her dad, Zoey paused, a flash of sadness crossing her face, "Anyway, I know quite a bit. Don't worry about me. Mr. Wright might want to set me up with Ruben, but I'm not interested. I'll never date a detective. You need to find me a perfect man!"

It seemed Zoey didn't have a good relationship with her father. I didn't ask further and sighed, "Where am I supposed to find you a perfect man? As long as you're safe and sound, that's enough."

###chapter 29 Billy

My car trailed behind Benjamin's as we rolled up to the Entertainment Club. From a distance, I spotted a guy in a suit waving at us.

This dude looked to be around forty, bald, a bit chubby, short, with tiny eyes, a big nose, and a face plastered with a smile. This had to be the club manager Benjamin mentioned, the witness who did not appear at the first trial. His surname was apparently Lopez.

As soon as we parked, Billy Lopez came hustling over with a few bottles of water, grinning and handing them out to the four of us, trying way too hard to be nice. But when he got to Tanner, his face twisted with anger, and he spat out, "You lowlife, I got you now! You almost cost me my job. If the cops weren't here, I'd beat you to death."

Tanner just stared at the ground, not reacting at all.

"Mr. Lopez, we're on duty. Take the water back," Benjamin said, cool as ever.

"Mr. Wright, don't be so formal. You and Mr. Adams are my heroes! You caught Tanner, and if you hadn't, the club would've shut down, and my boss would've fired me."

Billy, all puffed up with self-righteousness, patted his belly and said, "I'm not an ungrateful guy. Mr. Wright, you are a big deal, serving the people, fighting for justice, eradicating evil. But I'm just a regular guy. My wife said we should give you a banner that says 'Lifesaver.' Even though we've only met once, your image in my mind is exceptionally grand. I thought about it all night and couldn't sleep. This morning, I had an idea! Police and civilians in harmony, today we show our gratitude to you with harmony!"

He flashed his phone, showing a payment record, and said, "Mr. Wright, don't worry, this isn't public money. I paid for this water myself. If your bosses give you trouble, I'll show them the receipt and clear your name..."

"Alright, let's cut to the chase," Ruben interrupted, clearly fed up.

Zoey leaned over and whispered to me, "Mrs. Smith, this manager can really talk. Just four bottles of water, and he spins it into being a lifesaver and police-civilian harmony. No wonder he's a manager."

I nodded. This guy wasn't simple. He said a lot, but it was all to buy time. While he was talking, he was checking everyone out, especially glancing at Zoey and me a few times, probably pegging us as reporters, so he was being careful.

"Mr. Lopez, let's skip the small talk. I already told you why we're here on the phone. Has the person who bought drugs from Tanner shown up?" Ruben asked.

"Mr. Adams, keep it down. I'm risking my neck to help you!" Billy nervously glanced around and whispered, "He's here, in a private room on the third floor. The waiters are keeping an eye on him. If anything happens, they'll call me right away!"

"Mr. Wright, should we head up now or...?" Ruben nudged Benjamin for his take.

Benjamin seemed lost in thought, his eyes fixed on a nearby food stall called 'Ronald Food Truck.' I remembered chatting with the owner when I was investigating the Entertainment Club a few days ago. The owner had mentioned that the club was suspected of organizing prostitution.

"Mr. Lopez, how long has that stall been there?" Benjamin asked, pointing to the diner.

"Over two years. Our night shift guys eat there at noon! Is that guy a criminal too?" Billy squinted at the stall, looking annoyed.

"How is that possible? He looks like someone from my village. I'm telling you, this guy is a good person, making money isn't easy, don't disturb his business!" Benjamin instructed.

"Of course, this is practically our company's cafeteria. The food is good, portions are generous, and prices are fair. I knew he couldn't be a criminal!" Billy quickly changed his tune, nodding eagerly.

'Someone from the village? Clearly lying. Cindy said Benjamin's family is from Silverlight City, how could he recognize someone from a village?' I glanced at Benjamin, who shook his head slightly.

"Tanner, I'm gonna unlock your cuffs. Don't worry about your mom, I'll keep it from her. Cooperate well, and this will count as a contribution, you'll get leniency. I keep my word."

Benjamin gave Tanner a serious look, took out his phone, dialed a number, put it on speaker, and held it to his mouth.

After a few rings, someone answered.

A man's voice came from the other end, "Hello, Mr. Green?"

"Damn, Duke Hill, where are you? Have you arrived?" Tanner shouted, apparently their usual way of greeting.

"I'm here, at True Love Entertainment Club. Where are you? Hurry up, I can't wait!" The person named Duke on the other end said, with a girl's crying in the background.

What was going on?

We all looked at Billy, who innocently waved his hands, showing his phone to indicate he hadn't received any messages.

Benjamin gave Tanner a look, and Tanner nodded, continuing, "You're lying. I hear a woman crying. Where are you? Are you with the police? Fuck you, I'd be an idiot to give you more goods!"

"No way! If I'm ever be with the police, I swear I'll die a miserable death. I'm disciplining my wife, a born whore, a prostitute, cheating on me. I'll beat her to death!" Duke shouted.

There was the sound of hitting and cursing on the phone. The girl's voice sounded familiar, but I couldn't place it.

Tanner's eyes filled with anger, and he shouted, "Not a word of truth from you. You said you'd only get goods from me, but I haven't seen you in over a month. I thought you overdosed. Tell me who stole my business, or I won't give you any goods!"

Tanner glanced at Benjamin, who nodded, signaling him to continue. 

Hearing that Tanner wouldn't give him any goods, Duke panicked. "Mr. Green, I'm sorry, it was Paul Baker. Paul said not to get from you, his is cheaper. You have to give me some, I'm out after today."

###chapter 30 Coincidence

Benjamin gave an "OK" sign, showing he got it.

"Cool, I'm close by. I'll grab a ride-share and be there in about ten minutes." Tanner ended the call.

"Not a total bust," Benjamin said, running a hand through his hair and letting out a relieved sigh. "Paul got nabbed a while back, but he's been stubborn, claiming he wasn't dealing drugs. His detention time is almost up, and without more proof, we'd have to cut him loose. But now, we've got a key witness."

"Alright, Ruben, start setting things up," Benjamin said, giving Ruben a pat on the shoulder. Despite the slip-ups, this case had been Ruben's from the start, and he needed to see it through. As his mentor, Benjamin would back him up.

"Yes, Mr. Wright," Ruben replied.

Looking serious, Ruben checked the time and quickly gave instructions, "It's been about two minutes since the call. Tanner, head up in about eight minutes. Ride-shares are usually on time, so don't go up early and tip them off. The club's packed and chaotic, so to avoid any screw-ups, Mr. Wright and I will go up two minutes later."

"I've got an idea. How about you two pose as VIPs, and I'll tag along?" Billy suggested with a grin.

"This is a police operation, not your place to speak!" Ruben snapped at Billy.

Ruben had always been wary of this club, so there was no way he'd let Billy join them.

Despite his earlier rookie mistake, Ruben now had the decisive and upright demeanor of a seasoned detective. Benjamin had indeed not misjudged him.

"These two are accompanying journalists. After we go up, you bring them up," Ruben said to Billy. Then he turned to us and said, "Mrs. Smith, Ms. Taylor, be careful when you go up."

"Got it."

It seemed Ruben had trusted me and Zoey to keep an eye on Billy, a sign of trust.

Zoey had looked uneasy since earlier. When I asked her quietly, she said she was fine. It was likely nerves from her first time accompanying detectives. I felt a pang of guilt. Even though we were just catching a drug user and had police protection, it was still somewhat dangerous. Zoey, still a student, might find this task too heavy.

When the time came, Tanner went into the club first.

Shortly after, Benjamin and Ruben followed. Before leaving, Benjamin reminded us repeatedly to stay safe and leave immediately if the drug user acted up. Safety first.

Only Billy and the two of us were left.

Billy tried to make conversation, and I responded half-heartedly. We needed to complete the operation first, then investigate him. Zoey, now more composed, just smiled and didn't speak to Billy.

When the time came, Billy led us into the club.

The lobby was lavishly decorated, with a ceiling over 13 feet high and a huge crystal chandelier hanging in the middle, exuding luxury. A faint fragrance filled the air. As Billy led us to the elevator, Zoey whispered, "Mrs. Smith, this club is really wealthy. The lobby looks like a palace."

Billy seized the opportunity, giving a thumbs up, "You know your stuff. The lobby's design is indeed modeled after a palace. Not just in the city, but in the whole state, you won't find another like it!"

"Mr. Lopez, can you give us a rundown of the club's layout? Might be a good spot to bring clients next time," I asked.

"Sure thing! Just drop my name, and I'll hook you up with a discount!" Billy, sensing a business opportunity, grinned even wider. "So, the first floor has the lobby, offices, and staff quarters. The second and third floors have regular rooms, and the fifth and sixth floors are for VIPs. If you come by, let me know ahead of time, and I'll get you a VIP room at regular rates!"

"What about the fourth floor?" I asked, feeling a bit anxious since this was my first time so close to a crime scene.

"The fourth floor..." Billy started to explain, but the elevator doors opened, and a panicked staff member rushed out. Seeing Billy, he shouted, "Mr. Lopez, come quick! Lally's getting beaten to death!"

'Lally! The crying girl on the phone earlier was Lally!' I suddenly remembered, recognizing the voice. I bolted into the elevator, with Billy and Zoey right behind me.

When we reached the third floor, I dashed out, with Zoey close on my heels. Billy yelled, "Slow down, be careful!"

The hallway was packed with staff. I pushed through the crowd and entered the room.

Benjamin was on the phone, and Ruben had a skinny guy pinned to the ground. It had to be Duke. Tanner stood silently, staring at Lally in the corner.

Blood was splattered on the floor, along with torn clothes. Lally's bare upper body was covered with Benjamin's jacket. She was crouched in the corner, blood still trickling from her forehead. Her face was pale, her eyes empty and lifeless.

"Tanner, you bastard! I knew you were no good!" Duke, pinned by Ruben, kept cursing, "Did you all sleep with Lally? One by one or all together? Was it exciting? Did you film it? Show me! Or how about we all go at it together?"

I glared coldly at Duke. He was naked, with needle marks covering the veins on his arms, thighs, and neck. Used disposable syringes lay on the table.

A wave of disgust washed over me.

"Benjamin, help me pull out his left hand. I want to see."

Benjamin easily pulled out Duke's left hand. Long-term drug use had emaciated him, making his hand look like a claw. But I could clearly see a tattoo of "Lally."

He was Lally's boyfriend, the one who attacked Tony at Digital Leap Technologies Company months ago.

"I've called the station. They'll be here soon, and an ambulance is on the way," Benjamin said, showing his badge. "Duke, you're under arrest for drug use, drug trafficking, and assault. Come with us to the station."

Hearing "police," Duke turned pale. The drug's effect seemed to wane, and he trembled, pleading, "Lally, save me. Tell them you wanted to be hit. I'll listen to you from now on... Lally, say something. I don't want to go to jail."

"I didn't use drugs! Where's your evidence? I'm diabetic! I inject myself for treatment. You can't just arrest people! Let me go, or I'll call the police!" Duke shouted hysterically.

"Call who? I am the police!" Ruben couldn't hold back, shouting.

"Lally, save me."

Hearing Duke call her repeatedly, Lally, who was crouching in the corner, twitched her fingers, and tears welled up in her vacant eyes.

###chapter 31 In the Name of Love

Before long, the cops showed up.

They took Duke away, and I told Benjamin and Ruben to head back first. Zoey and I would stay with Lally until the ambulance got here.

Since we found her, there was no need to stick to the original plan. Plus, Lally had been through hell, and the jerk who did it was her own boyfriend.

When people shot up, their brains went into overdrive, and they lost control. They became fixated on sex and violence. Duke probably raped Lally after getting high.

I didn't want to ask her anything right now. I grabbed a tissue and gently wiped her wounds.

Her face was pale, lips dry and tightly shut. She was silent, her whole body cold and shaking. Her pale fingers clutched her clothes, trying to cover herself.

"Don't worry, the guy's gone. You're safe now. The ambulance is on its way. Just try to relax," Zoey said softly. I kept glancing at the door, wondering why the doctor wasn't here yet.

Lally shook her head, opened her mouth, and said hoarsely, "Hospital... costs money... go home."

She started shaking more, her breathing getting faster. I began to panic. This didn't seem like just psychological trauma; it looked physical too.

But when I cleaned her wounds earlier, there was only a small cut on her forehead, no other visible injuries. This reaction seemed too severe.

Then it hit me. From the moment we got here, Lally had been squatting in the corner. Benjamin tried to help her up before he left, but she clung to her clothes and wouldn't move.

"Lally, where are you hurt? Lally? Lally?"

She passed out.

Right then, the doctor arrived.

The medics put her on a stretcher, and her clothes fell to the ground, revealing large bite marks, bruises on her arms, and several needle marks still bleeding.

In the corner she had been guarding, there were two disposable syringes.

Duke had forced Lally to inject a ton of drugs. Even in her confused and near-fainting state, she still tried to protect him by hiding the syringes.

"Bastard!" Zoey's angry shout echoed in the room. I stared at the syringes in the corner, unable to calm down.

In the ambulance, Zoey and I were silent.

I wanted Zoey to go home. This was a lot to handle, and she was still young. But then I thought, as a journalist, she'd have to face stuff like this eventually. Besides, Zoey wouldn't leave until she saw Lally wake up.

The ambulance got to the hospital fast, and Lally was rushed to the emergency room.

Zoey and I waited outside. Benjamin called to check in. I told him what happened. There was a long silence on the other end, then Benjamin said, "Got it." He hung up, and just before the call ended, I heard him say, "Fuck."

Even a seasoned detective would be pissed at such a vile act. He was holding back.

Duke's crazy behavior had ruined not just himself but Lally too.

Zoey and I watched the light outside the emergency room, time dragging on.

"Mrs. Smith, why do you think Lally still protected Duke even now?" Zoey asked after a long silence.

Yeah, why? This guy, who was basically a zombie, why did she still protect him? And at the cost of her own life?

I shook my head, clueless.

To make things worse, an employee from the Entertainment Club had filmed the whole incident and posted it online.

Zoey handed me her phone. In less than two hours, it had blown up on various platforms.

What I didn't expect was that most people were bashing Lally, calling her brainless, uneducated, manipulated, saying she deserved it for sticking with such a guy, and that she lacked love.

I was stunned. Without any evidence, the internet had already started judging.

Public opinion and the internet always claimed to be fair and rational. Everyone acted like a god, using extreme moralism as a disguise, mercilessly judging what they saw.

From the so-called "none of my business" to actively joining the discussion, people shouted for justice, claiming it as a great progress of the times. In reality, it was a huge moral decline. Everyone hid their insecurities and cowardice behind a delicate facade, pretending to be invincible giants in the virtual space.

These people criticized all that was beautiful and sincere as worthless, equating love and ideals with stupidity. The rationality and fairness they spoke of were extreme selfishness and despicability.

This kind of info wouldn't continue to spread. Based on my experience, the relevant authorities would quickly block such information and wait for the final announcement from the police.

I handed the phone back to Zoey and fell silent again.

After a long time, I asked, "Zoey, why do you think?"

Zoey thought for a moment and said, "If it's in the name of love, it kinda makes sense."

I nodded.

Even facing death, she stubbornly protected Duke, even though he had subjected her to violence, rape, and forced drug injection. Such a person might not be smart, might be stubborn, might not know how to adapt, or as netizens said, foolishly loyal to love.

If it was in the name of love, then there was another conclusion: she might be kind.

Why would such a kind person commit perjury in court?

I couldn't understand.

The light outside the emergency room went out, and the doctor came out, asking, "Who is the patient's family?"

"Hi, we're journalists. The patient's family hasn't been contacted yet. How is she?" Zoey and I quickly stood up and ran over.

The doctor took off his mask and let out a long breath. "You two did a great job. The timely rescue saved her life, but she's still unconscious and will need to stay in the ICU for a while for observation."

"However, I must ask, from the patient's condition, there are bruises on her arms and thighs, indicating she was forcibly restrained for some time. There are also signs of vaginal tearing, indicating sexual assault. Additionally..."

The doctor looked serious. "From the symptoms, it appears to be her first time injecting morphine-like drugs, and the overdose caused convulsions and shock. In all my years of practice, this is the first time I've seen such a case. What exactly did the patient go through to suffer such abuse?"

###chapter 32 A Moment of Peace

The doctor's voice bounced off the empty hallway walls.

Filled with anger, he wondered why a girl as fragile as a flower had to go through such hell.

Rape, sexual assault, and the most lethal of all, forced drug injections-if this incident were fully exposed, what kind of trauma would it cause to Lally and to society as a whole?

"Dr. Gonzalez, the victim's case is confidential and can't be shared." Benjamin walked in from the ER corridor and asked, "What's the status?"

It seemed like the doctor, Bruce Gonzalez, and Benjamin knew each other.

"The immediate danger's over. She's still out cold, though. They pumped her full of morphine-like drugs. She might wake up in a few hours, or it could take a day. Even when she does wake up, she'll need to be in the ICU for a bit."

"Let the family know first. If anything changes, it'll be easier for them to sign the papers. Someone should handle the admission stuff." Bruce gave a few instructions and then got busy.

After walking Bruce out a few steps, Benjamin turned back and said, "I'll take care of the admission stuff in a bit."

"Has Lally's family been told?" I asked.

"No family, she's on her own." Benjamin pushed open the emergency exit door, lit a cigarette, and said, "While we were looking into Duke, we checked on Lally too. She's an orphanage kid."

"Both are the same age, born in '97, high school grads. They've been working together for years. Ruben went to the Entertainment Club this afternoon to check things out. Lally's been there for years, one of the longest employees. Other staff said she's nice, hardworking, but her boyfriend was bad news. She often had bruises. They told her to dump Duke, but she never did."

With that, Benjamin took a deep drag on his cigarette and slowly blew out a thin stream of smoke, "So, it makes sense. Two people leaning on each other, and Duke got hooked on drugs, dragging Lally down with him."

"Mr. Wright, about the video of Lally online today..." Zoey, who had been quiet, hesitated.

"The right people blocked it in time. Until we know more, public opinion will just make things worse and hurt the victim." Benjamin flicked away the cigarette butt and said, "I'll have someone from the team come over to watch her. It's late, you two should head home. You've worked hard today, especially you, Zoey. It's your first big scene as an intern. Go home and get some rest. From the Silverlight City Legal Journal's perspective, it's been a productive day."

"No need, Zoey, you go rest first. I'll stay here tonight," I said slowly.

"Mrs. Smith, I'll stay with you." Zoey quickly refused, tugging my sleeve, "I can write the article here."

"Listen, you go home first. It's been a long day, and the article can wait. Just get it to me by tomorrow night. As for the angle..."

Before I could finish, Zoey said without hesitation, "Let's write about Lally this time, from the victim's perspective, highlighting the dangers of drugs. This will address today's public opinion and align with the recent anti-drug campaign. I'll use pseudonyms for her name and background."

"Good." I felt proud. Zoey's choice of topics was getting better, not because of my guidance, but because of her own talent and hard work.

After some convincing, Zoey finally left the hospital, glancing back every few steps.

"Nancy, I didn't bring up Alan in front of Zoey. Why are you staying here tonight? Lally's perjury can be looked into later. It's the police's job to protect her. You've been here all afternoon; you don't need to stay another night. Go get some rest. I'll let you know as soon as she wakes up." Benjamin frowned and hesitated, "Or, I can have Cindy stay with you for a couple of days. You two were college roommates and get along well."

"No need." I shook my head and sat on a chair in the hallway, saying, "I'm not staying just to ask a few questions. I want to know why she did it and hear her story."

The moment she crouched in the corner, I knew I would never forget it.

To be so abused, forcibly injected with such a large dose of drugs, she should have completely lost self-awareness from a physiological standpoint. Yet, she still instinctively protected Duke.

Ignorant love wouldn't have such strong power in the face of life and death. What kind of bond did they share?

Moreover, when Benjamin mentioned the orphanage, I suddenly thought of Alan, who also grew up in an orphanage, and felt a natural sense of closeness.

I wanted to stay and watch her wake up, understand the truth behind the perjury, and then help her amend her testimony and live a normal life. This world was too cruel to the unfortunate. And I didn't want to see her get hurt again.

Benjamin didn't say anything more. We went to the ICU together, got a detailed update from the doctor, and soon after, the police station called, and he left.

I moved a chair and sat by Lally's bed. From the last time in court, to this afternoon at the Entertainment Club, to now, this was the third time we met. To be precise, it was the third time I saw her.

The large ICU was empty, just the two of us. Lally lay by the window.

For her, it might be a long-lost peace. This disaster, which might bring a huge change to her future, at least at this moment, allowed her to enjoy a moment of tranquility.

It was very quiet. Having just escaped from the clutches of death, her breathing was steady and smooth. If I listened closely, I could hear faint breathing sounds. I felt a sense of pity, even thinking it might be better if she stayed asleep. Waking up would mean facing this terrible world again.

The world had never changed; it was just our perspective that differed, like camera filters showing the same moon in different ways. I used to scoff at this, believing one must eventually come out of illusions.

But at this moment, I hoped she would sleep a little longer.

Even if she committed perjury, even if she harbored many secrets, I wasn't so heartless as to harbor immense hatred for everyone related to my husband.

She lay quietly on the hospital bed, eyes tightly shut, her face as pale as ever. The wound on her forehead was bandaged, and the bruises on her cheeks remained.

Lally was very delicate, simple, youthful, giving a feeling of a gentle breeze, an inexplicable sense of closeness.

Suddenly, I remembered her last words before she fainted, "Hospital... costs... go home."

What had life done to her? After every hardship, did she go home to lie in bed and endure it alone?

As I was thinking, her eyebrows twitched slightly. She woke up.

###chapter 33 Waking Up

She opened her eyes and reconnected with the world around her.

She felt confused, like she was in a dream, and closed her eyes again.

After a while, she let out a soft sigh.

"You're awake?" I asked gently.

Lally nodded.

"How are you feeling? Any pain or anything?"

"Thanks." She shook her head and glanced around. "How much is the medical bill? I'll pay you back."

"Don't worry about that right now. Just rest. Mr. Wright already handled the hospital stuff," I said softly.

"I... I have no money," Lally said quietly, sadness in her eyes.

"Use mine!" I offered.

Working at the District Attorney's office and the Silverlight City Legal Journal, I'd seen how medical bills could wreck lives. Silverlight City might look prosperous with its rising GDP, but a lot of people still couldn't afford medical care.

The skyscrapers and economic growth were just a facade; the real story was in the lives of the people struggling at the bottom.

"Thanks, but I should go home now," Lally replied.

She tried to sit up, but I gently stopped her. "At least wait until the doctor checks you out. Stay here for the night."

She didn't argue, slowly lying back down and looking out the window at the bright city lights.

I watched her quietly. Her eyes reflected the glitzy Silverlight City outside. Gradually, her vision blurred, and the city's illusions seemed to wash away with her tears.

"Thank you," Lally said hoarsely, her pale lips barely moving.

"It's nothing. Everyone has tough times. If I ever hit rock bottom, I'm sure you'd help me too," I said, pouring a glass of water and placing it beside her.

Lally sighed softly. This detail was something that only someone who had experienced life and seen people humbled to the dust could truly feel. There were many people in life who even sighed with caution.

"Relax, it's all over," I comforted her gently.

"You're a reporter, right?" Lally glanced at the badge on my chest and forced a smile. "It's okay, ask whatever you want. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here. Maybe I'd be dead."

"Let's wait until you feel better. I'm not in a hurry. I'm just here to see you."

I took off my badge and put it in my bag. "What do you want to eat? I'll get you something."

"Thanks, just talking is fine," Lally said, shaking her head slightly and forcing a smile. "You have a good heart. You'll be rewarded."

Would I be rewarded?

My heart ached a bit, and Alan's image floated into my mind. If good people always got rewarded, why was there so much suffering in the world?

Looking at the fragile and empty Lally in front of me, it was hard to believe she had given false testimony in court. Maybe I just wanted to clear her name quickly. I sat down beside her. "My name is Nancy Johnson. Just call me Nancy."

"I'm so envious of you, Nancy," Lally said softly, staring at the ceiling. "It's not about the job. It's more like... you have this calm, strong vibe, like you can protect everyone around you. I don't have that..."

Was she still thinking about Duke? Her words seemed to hint at wanting to know Duke's whereabouts.

"Duke's been arrested for drug trafficking, rape, and assault. You... you've actually done really well. Everyone has their own choices and paths to follow. You can't protect someone forever."

I wanted to tell her she didn't need to worry about these things anymore, but as an outsider looking at the victim, I couldn't fully understand her feelings. However, I had to respect her choices and actions.

"I understand, thank you."

She stared blankly at the ceiling, showing neither sadness nor joy. After a long time, she said slowly, "Nancy, you're really kind. Over the years, many people have told me to stay away from Duke. Later, I became a laughingstock, with people saying I was foolish for being with such a man. They weren't wrong... Maybe I really don't have any strength left, just wanting to hold on to this little bit."

"Whatever you do, good or bad, only you know in your heart. Everyone has different perspectives and sees things differently, but you..." I tried to comfort her, but the harsh reality was right in front of us. Words felt so empty and inadequate. I didn't know how to continue.

"Deserved it?" Lally laughed self-deprecatingly. "I feel like I've died once and come back to life, but nothing has changed... Nancy, let me tell you a story about him and me. It might be a bit cumbersome since I'm not well-educated."

I nodded.

"I grew up in an orphanage. Since I can remember, I've been with Duke. He was a very good person, Nancy. Have you ever been to an orphanage?" Lally asked.

"No, but I've heard friends talk about it," I answered.

Alan had mentioned the orphanage to me before. He rarely talked about that part of his life, saying the orphanage was noisy, and he was often bullied as a child. When he grew up and went to school, he never went back.

"Yeah, you've probably seen those short videos of happy kids in front of the camera, but it's not really like that. We were like commodities, only wearing new clothes and eating well when people came to adopt. The rest of the time was very hard, being bullied by other kids, beaten and scolded by staff, and often not having enough to eat."

Lally buried herself deep in the blanket, her eyes filled with fear, and said in a low voice, "I don't want to remember those times. Even now, I still dream about it, being beaten every day, in a dark, damp, cold room with rats and bugs. Older kids would steal your food, drink, and even pee in your bowl."

"Didn't anyone care?" I frowned. Twenty years ago, Silverlight City hadn't developed yet, but as a social welfare institution, the orphanage shouldn't have been like that. It was more like a prison.

"Nancy, we're different. I experienced despair at a very young age," Lally said.

###chapter 34 Irreplaceable

"You won't believe it, but the kids at that orphanage barely get enough to eat. It's crazy, right? You'd think things would be better these days."

Lally looked up at me and said, "It felt like we were stuck in some old-timey prison. The place was dark and creepy, and the kids there were more like little troublemakers. Even at such a young age, they'd sneak out at night to steal, rob, and even set fires for revenge. One winter, a whole family died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Turns out, it was those kids who did it... But in front of others, they acted all innocent and pitiful."

"I tried to report it, but the staff said I was lying and punished me by not giving me food for a day. When I got back, those kids beat me up for being a snitch. The staff said I was fighting and locked me in a tiny room. In winter, with just a thin shirt, I was freezing and starving."

"I was so scared and desperate. Can you imagine an eight-year-old thinking about suicide?"

"But then, my savior showed up. He gave me his clothes, and there was a piece of bread wrapped inside. It was so warm... I cried while eating, and he stood outside the door, shivering in the cold."

"Was it... Duke?" I asked, feeling sad.

Lally smiled and nodded, her face lighting up with happiness as tears silently rolled down her cheeks.

"The next day, he got locked up too. He fought with other kids to get food for me and got caught by the staff. When he came in, he was all bruised and battered. I panicked and cried non-stop. He smiled and said, 'Two people are not afraid.' He pulled out a piece of bread from his pocket. I was so hungry, I ate half and saved the other half for him. He said he wasn't hungry and that he was full. It was freezing at night, so he hugged me to keep me warm. For two whole days and nights, when I finally got out, he was burning up with a fever."

"Do you know what happens when an orphanage kid gets sick?" Lally asked.

I shook my head, feeling numb. This wasn't an orphanage; it was a prison!

"They give you some medicine, and if that doesn't work, they leave it to fate. If you die, they secretly take you out at night and bury you somewhere... I saw it once. When they picked up the child, he was limp, his head drooping. The staff said he was asleep, but I knew he was dead."

"Duke almost died then. His body was cold, and I couldn't wake him no matter how hard I tried. When the staff picked him up, I held on tight, not letting them take him away. I knew if they took him, we'd never see each other again. But just then, Duke mumbled my name, Lally."

"That's how he wasn't taken away. He often mentioned it later, saying I saved him. If he hadn't known me, he wouldn't have called my name. I said he saved me."

Hearing this, I let out a long sigh. The Duke in the story and the one I met in real life were completely different. According to Lally, Duke was a kind and righteous kid. How did he end up like this?

I didn't interrupt Lally's memories.

"A few years later, the kids at the orphanage were in their teens, their bodies starting to develop..."

I frowned, sensing something was wrong. According to her, those bad kids at that age...

Lally gave a bitter smile and said, "I was first assaulted at 14, just after graduating from elementary school. I didn't dare tell the staff or the teachers at the orphanage. They wouldn't care or believe me."

"That night, Duke told me we should leave the orphanage. I wanted to study, and he said he did too. We planned to go to school during the day and work after school. If anyone asked, we'd say our parents weren't home, and we were siblings. Every few years, we'd move to avoid being found. So, we left the orphanage. The teachers didn't ask, and the orphanage didn't bring it up. Somehow, we managed to survive."

I frowned. Twenty years ago, two fourteen-year-olds in the developing Silverlight City, what kind of challenges would they face? Going to school during the day and working at night seemed impossible, but they made it work.

"The house was small, but it was our happiest place. Duke said he wanted to earn money to support my education, buy a house, and live our lives. I said, why should he? I wanted to earn money to support his education too. We couldn't give up on each other."

At this point, Lally closed her eyes, a faint smile on her lips, lost in her memories.

"And then?" I asked.

"Then, I got into Silverlight University, but Duke didn't. He started working. In my sophomore year, I dropped out," Lally said.

Benjamin had told me that both Lally and Duke had high school diplomas. I didn't expect Lally to have gotten into college, and the best one in Silverlight City. It was the best chance to change her fate. Why did she drop out?

Thinking of Duke, I had a vague answer. From then on, Duke gradually fell into decline, and Lally was dragged down with him.

"Nancy, you can probably guess the reason I dropped out." Lally nodded tiredly. "He got addicted to drugs and owed a lot of money. From then on, he changed. When he was normal, he was the same as before, but when he wasn't, he was paranoid, angry, and irritable."

"Nancy, if it were you, would you cut ties and let him fend for himself?" Lally asked. I had no answer.

"Fate is like that. After giving you enough gifts, it starts to demand repayment, perhaps even more than you can give..." Lally said sadly. "Yes, I could have taken the easy way out, cut ties. When he came to me, I could have pretended not to know him, even called the police. The law doesn't care about personal feelings. Black is black, white is white."

"After graduation, I could have moved to another city, found a good job, and burned the past like it was a previous life. I could have married a normal man and lived a normal life. All of that would have been very good. Even if the truth came out, I don't think people would blame me. After all, self-preservation is human's nature, right?"

I nodded. When Lally said she dropped out, I thought the same. To an outsider, the process of the story didn't seem that important. It was like reading a book; as long as the ending was good, it was fine. Besides, Duke was indeed beyond saving.

"Yes, all of that would have been very good, but I just didn't want it." Lally touched the scar on her forehead. "Without him, I would have committed suicide long ago. Without me, he wouldn't be alive now. We have long been each other's salvation."

"Nancy, later I watched short videos and saw many people talking about love and family. I didn't understand what they were saying. I don't know what the relationship between Duke and me is."

"But... it's very good and irreplaceable." As she spoke, Lally shed tears of happiness.

###chapter 35 Has the person been discharged from the hospital?

That night, I couldn't tell if it was sudden trust or just gratitude for saving her life.

Either way, Lally and I ended up talking a lot, like she was finally letting out everything she'd been holding in for years.

I just listened quietly, ordered some takeout, got us some light food, and after we ate a bit, it was already past 11 PM, almost midnight.

The hospital doc had already checked her out, and everything seemed fine. They suggested she rest for a few days. Lally told me to go home, saying she was okay and felt a bit awkward with me hanging around the hospital. I agreed.

I also called Benjamin to let him know Lally had woken up and was doing okay for now. He told me to go home and rest, and said he'd have someone from the team come over to keep an eye on things.

Before I left, I had a quick word with the nurse on duty, left my number, and asked them to call me if anything came up with Lally.

By the time I got home, it was already 1 AM. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, thinking about everything that had happened to Lally.

Was Lally wrong? No, she wasn't. With everything she'd been through, how could she just abandon it all and start fresh?

Was Duke wrong? Yeah, he was. He shouldn't have gotten into drugs or done all those bad things. But was it entirely his fault? How much had he suffered over the years?

When he was still a child, he could confidently say to Lally, "I'll take care of you, I'll support you through school, we won't leave each other, we'll rely on each other to survive..."

Fate had a funny way of messing with people, and it was not always about right or wrong.

I thought for a moment and opened Facebook. Zoey should be asleep by now, so I left her a message: [Zoey, when you see this tomorrow, please reply. We're holding off on publishing the report for now. Lally's situation is really complicated, and a simple anti-drug article won't do it justice. I'll explain everything to you in detail tomorrow. Let's make this the headline article for the monthly magazine.]

I thought of another topic: [Is the orphanage from twenty years ago still around?] 

It wasn't just Lally and Duke who faced such tragic fates; there were many unfortunate children, some of whom might have died young. The person in charge of that orphanage needed to be held accountable; we couldn't simply let it pass!

Unexpectedly, Zoey replied right away: [Okay, Mrs. Smith, I'll hold off and wait for your new content. How's Lally doing? Are you at the hospital? Have you eaten? Do you want me to bring you something? My mom cooked a lot of food today.]

Nancy: [Thanks, I've eaten. Lally's awake and doing okay. I came back for now and will head to the hospital early tomorrow to see her. You should get some rest.]

Zoey: [Okay, Mrs. Smith.]

I smiled a bit. Zoey is really thoughtful. I felt a warmth in my heart as I touched the blanket she gave me and sent a message: [Zoey.]

Zoey: [What's up, Mrs. Smith?]

Nancy: [The blanket is really warm. I love it. Thank you.]

Zoey: [Mrs. Smith, good night.]

Nancy: [Good night, Zoey.]

The next day, I woke up early, got ready, and drove to the hospital.

Lally's outpouring last night, along with a whole night's rest, should have helped her recover quite a bit. Today, I wanted to ask her directly about Alan's case, why she gave false testimony in court, and how much she knew about the truth of the case.

Maybe it was because of Alan, but I always felt a pang of sympathy whenever the orphanage came up. Alan didn't talk much about it, but his childhood there must've been rough. For Lally, if she wasn't too deep in this mess, I'd do everything I could to help her get back on her feet.

She'd been through enough already.

The first bit of light in her life had turned into a shadow, so I wanted to open a window for her to let in some new sunlight.

I parked in the hospital garage, didn't head upstairs right away, and went to the entrance to grab some breakfast for her.

But when I got to her room, it was empty. The bed was neatly made, with some money and a note on top.

It read: [Nancy, this is Lally. Thank you for saving me and for listening to my stories last night. Last night was probably the bravest I've ever been, facing my past and myself. There are still some things I didn't talk about. I don't want to remember them, and I don't want to hurt you. But it's all in the past, so it doesn't matter if I talk about it or not. I checked out this morning and paid the hospital fees. You've helped me enough, and I can't let you spend more money.]

I quickly asked the nurse on duty, but she didn't know much. She said she saw Lally in the room around 6 AM.

I checked the time; it was 8:30 AM.

She couldn't have gone far. I rushed to the security office and described Lally's height, clothing, and appearance, asking if they'd seen her.

The security guard said there were too many people coming and going every morning to remember.

I had no choice but to call Benjamin for help. "Benjamin, Lally checked out early this morning and left. Can you help me find out where she lives?"

"When did this happen?"

"Around 6 AM. I went up at 8:30, so about an hour and a half ago."

"She can't have gone far. Hold on, I'll ask a colleague at the registration office."

On the other end, Benjamin called a colleague at the registration office, asking for Lally's address. The officer said they could only find her address from a few years ago, but that place had been demolished, and they couldn't find her current address.

I suddenly thought of the Entertainment Club. Maybe her colleagues there would know where she lived.

Benjamin hung up and quickly contacted Billy at the Entertainment Club, asking me to wait for news.

Sure enough, not long after, Benjamin called back with an address near Elm Street in Silverlight City.

I checked the map; it wasn't far, about a ten-minute drive. I grabbed the breakfast and rushed to the parking lot, driving off.

This time, unlike with Tammy, I quickly found her place following the address. It was an old neighborhood, probably about ten years old, with the highest building being six stories.

Her address was Unit 3, fourth floor, apartment 402.

I knocked on the door, hoping someone would answer.

Soon, I heard footsteps inside, and I felt a surge of joy.

Lally opened the door. I glanced inside and saw that she seemed to be packing things. Was she planning to move?

"Nancy, why are you here?"

Lally's eyes lit up, then quickly dimmed and she said, "Of course, how could you not find me... Come in."

###chapter 36 Two Photos (1)

Lally was definitely packing up her stuff, with bags all lined up on the floor, ready to go.

The apartment was a simple one-bedroom, around 550 square feet, with a living room, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom. It was cozy but not cramped.

Even though it was small, it was super clean. The floor had some cracks, but it was spotless, no dirt anywhere. The metal-framed windows were rusty, but the glass was clear, no rain streaks at all.

It was obvious Lally cleaned regularly and was very thorough.

"Are you moving already, so soon?" I asked. Just out of the hospital and already planning to move?

"Yeah, but I haven't found a new place yet. Just thought I'd start packing to avoid a last-minute rush," Lally said, quickly inviting me to sit down and rushing to the kitchen to get some water.

"Lally, don't worry about it. I brought breakfast."

I stopped her and walked over to put the breakfast on the dining table.

That was when I noticed a pot of purple flowers on the table. It was late autumn, and not many flowers were blooming this time of year. The flowers were spike-shaped, kind of like wheat but fuller, with a purple that wasn't too flashy. The buds were black at the top and white at the base, giving them a unique and deep look.

"Lally, what's the name of this flower? I've never seen it before. It's really pretty," I asked, trying to lighten the mood. It was clear Lally had a good eye for life's little details.

"This flower is called heather. It's not rare, very cheap and easy to take care of. It can bloom in winter, just needs some water and sunlight. I've had it for years, and Duke likes it too."

When she mentioned Duke, she went quiet and ate without saying a word.

"Lally, there's something I want to ask you." I figured it was best to be direct.

"Nancy, go ahead."

"I've been looking into the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case for a column. I heard you were a witness and wanted to know more about what happened."

Thinking back to Lally's testimony in court, she seemed different from the Lally in front of me. In court, she was sharp and decisive, even harsh towards Laura. But from yesterday to today, and from what colleagues said, Lally was gentle, kind, and caring.

As expected, Lally's face showed discomfort when I brought it up.

"That incident... Nancy, I don't really want to talk about it," Lally said hesitantly.

"What's wrong? It's okay if you didn't say everything or missed something. I can help you," I added, trying to signal that even if she had lied, I could help her fix it.

To my disappointment, Lally shook her head and repeated what she had said in court.

I didn't push it. If she wouldn't talk about Tony, asking might just make things worse.

After breakfast, I helped her pack. There wasn't much, and we quickly finished except for the bedroom.

The bedroom was small, with photos covering the walls, mostly of Lally and Duke. Lally took them down one by one, saying, "Nancy, I thought about it last night. When he gets out, we'll leave Silverlight City and go somewhere else."

"Okay," I replied.

I wanted to mention that rehab wasn't a walk in the park and Duke's release was still up in the air, but looking at their photos, showing their love and happiness, I just couldn't do it.

Then, Lally handed me a photo that really caught my eye.

It was a picture of three kids, around ten years old, with a familiar backdrop of a single-story house. The boy in the middle was grinning ear to ear, flashing a 'V' sign with his hands. The girl looked shy, with her hands behind her back, smiling but looking away. In the corner, a boy was squatting, staring at the girl.

The two looking at each other were Lally and Duke.

The boy making the 'V' sign looked familiar. Suddenly, it hit me-it was Tony!

Remembering Lally saying they moved every few years after leaving the orphanage, they had lived in Sand Village!

The small house in the background was Tony's house. I had been there, and the newer part was added later.

The unknown man James mentioned at Digital Leap Technologies Company wasn't a stranger. They had known each other for a long time!

Tammy definitely knew Lally, and they weren't just colleagues!

Who took the photo?

There couldn't be such coincidences in the world.

"Lally, is this Tony?" I asked suddenly.

"Nancy, how did you know?" Lally was surprised. It seemed Tony hadn't told her I was investigating.

"What a coincidence! My colleague recently took a case from Sand Village about a dispute a few years ago. Tony was the victim but didn't get proper compensation. His mother was very worried. The newspaper wanted to write an article to draw attention. I happened to see it and thought the boy looked like Tony."

I couldn't tell Lally about my visit to Tammy's house, or it would all be exposed.

"What a coincidence, really. Good people get good rewards." Lally was delighted and said, "Tony is a good person. Duke and I lived there for two years, and his family took good care of me. Nancy, can Tony get his compensation?"

She didn't know Tony and Zack used the compensation to buy insurance.

"It might be difficult. We're just a newspaper, we can only raise awareness, not enforce anything. We'll do our best," I said lightly.

"By the way, I heard Tony has a brother who's doing well. He handled the demolition, and Tony's injury might be related to him. Is that true? It sounds like a rumor." I sensed something and cautiously probed.

"No, that's not possible. Don't listen to village gossip. Zack wouldn't do that. Tony's family was so good to him. Zack wouldn't do such a thing. It would be too outrageous."

"Tony's family was good to him... They're not biological brothers?" I sensed a key point.

"No, we went to Sand Village because Zack invited us. Zack is also from the orphanage, but he was lucky to be adopted by Tony's family."

Zack was adopted!

###chapter 37 Two Photos (2)

"No wonder I was confused about how two brothers could have different last names," I said, nodding along with Lally. "A colleague mentioned that Tony's wife has always had issues with Zack. They haven't seen each other since the incident. Is that true? Are they really not in touch now?"

The demolition case happened in 2019, and by 2020, Zack and Tony had taken out an insurance policy with Tammy as the beneficiary. Had they been in contact over the years? Tony used his big compensation payout to take out such a large policy. Zack would definitely have asked about it, and I even suspect Zack knew why Tony did it. Otherwise, he wouldn't have agreed.

This insurance policy was also Tony's final arrangements.

What were Tony and Zack planning that required the cost of life insurance? From my investigation, Tony hadn't done anything reckless in recent years, so the most likely connection was still with Alan's case.

The only problem was that there was a four-year gap between these two events. That was a long time.

"Nancy, how would Anna know about what happened before Tony got married? They've been married for less than three years, right? They got married at the end of 2021, and Duke and I both attended," Lally said, snorting. "It's better not to listen to that woman too much. I used to think she was nice, knowing Tony was disabled and still marrying him. But later, I found out that this woman is not decent in her words and actions."

This was true. James also mentioned the relationship between Anna and an investor from Digital Leap Technologies, and Tony knew about it.

What puzzled me was why Duke sought out Tony, accusing him of having slept with Lally. From my understanding of the two, there shouldn't be such an aberrant relationship.

"I think it would be more appropriate to hint at Tony," I said, thinking out loud. Actually, I wanted to know more about the relationship between Lally and Tony, and whether Tony was involved in this case.

"It's useless. I've said it many times," Lally frowned. "Nancy, you don't know. Once Tony makes up his mind, he won't change it. I even talked to him about it that night in April, and it caused a lot of misunderstandings..." Lally hesitated.

April... wasn't that when Duke went to find Tony?

"Misunderstanding? At night? Did Anna misunderstand when you talked to Tony?" I asked.

"No, Nancy, how could that be," Lally sighed. "I have Anna on Facebook, but we've never talked. Around mid-April, I casually asked Tony about Anna during a phone call, and Tony said she was on a business trip. The next night, I saw Anna posting travel photos on her feed, hugging a man. I guess she forgot to block me."

"I couldn't say it outright, so I went to Sand Village to find Tony that night and told him about it. We hadn't seen each other for a long time, and we talked late into the night. Tony also advised me to temporarily break up with Duke, but I didn't agree. Unfortunately, that night Duke... wasn't quite himself." Lally's eyes darkened as she spoke, and I understood. Duke must have been on drugs that night, and Lally probably got beaten up.

"The next morning, he went to Tony's company to make trouble and came back with a bruised face." Lally mentioned Duke, and tears welled up in her eyes.

This all lined up. James from Digital Leap Technologies said Tony and Duke had a fight, and Tony, unusually, hit him hard, which shocked him.

So Tony knew about Duke's drug problem. Lally and Duke had a tough journey, and the three of them had a deep friendship. Tony hitting him hard was out of pity and anger.

"Did Tony tell you about the fight?" I asked.

"Yeah, Tony came to our house two days later and scolded Duke. When Duke is normal, he's a good person and apologized to Tony," Lally recalled. "But that day, Tony was really angry, scolding him from the orphanage days to recent years!"

"Orphanage? Didn't you meet Zack in Sand Village?" I asked, remembering Lally said Zack invited them over.

After Lally explained, I got it. Zack was several years older than Duke and Lally and had always taken care of them in the orphanage. Later, Tammy and her husband adopted Zack. When Duke and Lally couldn't get enough to eat at the orphanage, they would sneak out to find Zack. According to Lally, the orphanage was about half an hour away from Sand Village, and they often went there. Zack treated them like siblings, giving them whatever was in the kitchen.

Unfortunately, Tammy and her husband found out. They were kind-hearted and pitied them, but their financial situation was limited, so they couldn't take care of so many kids. They helped as much as they could, and that was how they met Tony.

"Tony really has a deep friendship with you guys, it's not easy," I sighed after hearing this. Tammy and her husband were kind-hearted, adopting Zack and also taking care of Lally and Duke. Who would have thought Tammy's husband would pass away early, Tony would become disabled, Duke would get addicted to drugs, and Lally would become a victim.

"Yeah, Tony is really good. That day he spoke harshly, saying if Duke messed up again, he would tell Zack and Toby to deal with him! Duke promised well, and I thought he would remember and quit drugs, but who knew..."

"Who is Toby?" I asked. This was the first time I heard Lally mention this name.

"Toby is a role model for me and Duke. No, I should say for me, Duke, Zack, and Tony! Toby was also an orphanage kid, the same age as Zack, and they were very close!"

Lally's eyes lit up, temporarily forgetting the pain Duke caused her. It seemed that mentioning Toby made her forget all her troubles.

Lally continued, "I've never seen anyone like Toby. When he was in the orphanage, he was always covered in wounds, always getting beaten, and spent most of the year in the small dark room. In winter, it was very cold."

"Why, was he naughty?" I asked.

"I didn't understand before, but now I know, it was because of jealousy." Lally looked out the window, smiling slightly.

"Jealousy?" I asked.

Lally said, "Yes, everyone was jealous of him. The kids were jealous of his ability to read and write after just one try. The bullies would steal his food and bully him, wetting his clothes in winter, making him shiver and turn blue. The staff... no, the women at the orphanage were also jealous of him because Toby was better than their kids. I saw them slap Toby many times, not letting him eat, locking him in the small dark room... It seemed like all the world's malice was concentrated on him. Ms. Johnson, do you know what he did?"

###chapter 38 Two Photos (3)

I looked down and shook my head. In that place, what seemed right was actually wrong. Since they were kids, these folks had been stuck in a hellhole together, thinking it was the right way to live.

"Toby never did anything wrong. He didn't hold grudges or seek revenge. He was super kind to everyone. Even if someone beat him up one day, he'd still smile at them the next and even help them out. Eventually, those little punks started to fear him, calling him a fool."

"One time, a church came by to do some charity work. A priest heard about Toby and called him over, asking why he didn't fight back. Toby said, 'The world I see shouldn't be like this. The world isn't made by someone but seen by someone.' The priest was shocked and said, 'God has become a little boy.'"

Lally grinned with a weird kind of pride, "What God? I never believed in that stuff. Toby's just a good person, and good people don't get messed with by bad people."

I nodded. In the middle of all that darkness, the light of humanity that Toby held onto finally pushed the darkness away, giving him a little piece of peace.

"When Duke and I were kids, Toby taught us to read and write. We kept studying because of him. Toby was the first kid to leave the orphanage. He was amazing. I remember he started getting scholarships in middle school, and the teachers helped him find a place to live. Nancy, can you guess where Toby lived?"

I smiled a bit and said, "Sand Village, right?"

"Exactly!" Lally snapped her fingers. "Zack got adopted because of Toby's help. The days in Sand Village were probably the happiest of my life."

I really admired this kid named Toby, though he wasn't a kid anymore. He was a few years older than Lally and Duke, probably around my age. In such a tough environment, he managed to change his life through sheer effort. Most importantly, the light he carried not only lit up his own path but also influenced those around him.

"The world I see shouldn't be like this. The world isn't made by someone but seen by someone."

These words, coming from a boy who often encountered misfortune, were so pure, brave, and wise. He seemed like a beam of light sent to the orphanage, sweeping away the filth with his humanity and giving hope and strength to the kids stuck in misfortune.

"God has become a little boy."

I smiled knowingly. That wasn't wrong.

And twenty years later, the boy's words still had an impact on me. Lately, I'd been feeling a bit fatalistic. In reality, how one viewed destiny and the world was not determined by the world itself, but by one's own perspective.

Simple and straightforward truths seemed powerless not because the words lacked strength but because the environment was different.

"Thanks, Lally. Toby's words are really insightful and helpful," I said.

"You're welcome. Toby's just that kind of person. Everyone who meets him likes him," Lally replied.

As Lally spoke, she rummaged through a cabinet and finally found something wrapped in old newspaper. It looked ancient, with the yellowed paper falling apart, vaguely resembling a book.

"This book was given to me by Toby. He used to read it a lot. Later, everyone got a copy. Mine is the original edition, a poetry collection. I flipped through a few pages but couldn't understand it, so I kept it safe."

Lally carefully unwrapped the newspaper, treating it like a treasure. The worn cover was revealed, half of it already torn, with the author's name barely visible.

At that moment, her focus was entirely on the book, not noticing that my body had started trembling uncontrollably. When she unwrapped the newspaper and I saw the cover, my heart stopped, and Lally's words kept echoing in my mind...

No way. It couldn't have been such a coincidence.

All the information from the past few days flooded my mind-courtroom lies, investigating Tammy, Tony, and then Lally and Duke. Their tragic fates and turbulent stories had shocked me over and over.

The one who gave them strength and hope was the boy who was also in the depths of the abyss.

And that boy...

But the name of that book, I knew it all too well.

Toby, the orphanage, and his favorite poetry collection... Could it be him?

No, absolutely not! I must be overreacting and overthinking.

But they all came from the orphanage. Silverlight City had several orphanages and welfare homes. Fate had already sentenced Alan. It wouldn't let me...

An old black-and-white photo quietly slipped out from the book's pages, floating to the ground in a strange arc.

At my moment of desperation, like the scythe of death, it swung a cruel arc.

I squatted down, or rather, I no longer had the strength to stand, facing memories, facing the truth, facing fate. It was like opening Pandora's box, with all the pain flooding in.

It was a photo of a group from an orphanage.

The background was a three-story building, surrounded by high fences and walls, like a prison.

The children's faces were tender, with stiff smiles and hollow eyes. In the black-and-white photo, it was filled with a sense of despair.

But one spot was special. Those children's smiles were sincere, holding hands, shoulders touching. They huddled together as if to tell the world they were the only light. Duke and Lally held hands on the left side. Compared to now, time had washed away their tender faces, at the cost of blood and tears.

Above the two, on the left, were two familiar faces. I had seen, searched for, and talked to them, in the courtroom, in the café, Laura and Frank...

Above the two, on the right, I hadn't seen them in person but had seen photos. Howard had sent them to me. Since I recognized Laura and Frank, I naturally knew the identities of the other two.

They were the two who had never appeared but had spoken on the phone, part of the university group of five: Bob and Mike.

In the middle of the group of five, above Lally and Duke.

That child, of average height, obviously much older than Lally and Duke, with hands on their shoulders, smiling so brightly and warmly.

His eyes and face seemed unchanged from beginning to end, so gentle, conveying strength and hope to everyone.

God became a boy, walking among people.

He wasn't God; he was my husband.

He was Alan.

"Lally, what's this person's name?"

"His name is..." Lally paused, "His name is Toby Nelson."

"Good name, an extraordinary person. Lally, I have something to do, so I'll leave now."

I walked downstairs like a zombie, relying on instinct.

I had never felt so helpless. Everything and everyone seemed shrouded in a layer of fog.

The wind couldn't blow it away, and water couldn't penetrate it. Everyone was lying, hiding. I had no strength to think about anything anymore.

All the events of these days, like thousands of stage lights, focused on Alan.

Alan had always been reluctant to talk about the orphanage. It was a long winter, a hopeless hell.

It was so cold that my forehead felt hot. I forgot where I parked the car, instinctively walking forward. In the distance, a few police officers were walking towards me.

Was it Benjamin?

I fainted.

###chapter 39 The Long Goodbye

"Hey Alan, did you grow up in an orphanage? What was it like?"

"Yeah, it was pretty rough, but I got lucky. Everyone treated me well."

"Alan, why are you so scared of the cold? It's not very manly!"

"I've always been like this. As a kid, winter felt endless. I guess it just stuck with me."

"Your boss is totally taking advantage of you, making you do everything and work late every day. You shouldn't put up with that. I'm calling the Forestry Bureau tomorrow!"

"Relax, it's not just me. Everyone's working overtime."

It was a chilly winter night. After dinner, Alan was on the sofa, softly reading poetry. I had my head on his lap, half-asleep with my eyes closed.

The house was cozy. I was under a blanket, a bit sweaty on my forehead. Alan touched my head and asked, "Do you have a fever?"

I nodded sleepily, "Seems like it."

Feeling hot, I pushed the blanket off, letting the cool air hit my arms and legs. My head hurt a bit, and after a while, someone covered me again.

"I'll get some fever medicine, hang on," Alan said gently.

"Okay," I mumbled.

I was dizzy, thinking about moving to another spot to sleep, but I was too weak. Forget it, I'd just sleep here.

I drifted off into a deep sleep for a long time.

I had never felt this exhausted before. I used to be full of energy, working late into the night and still feeling great the next day.

Was it because I was getting old?

In a daze, I saw myself in the mirror with white hair, sitting in a wheelchair with a blanket on my knees, at the end of my life, about to die.

Memories flooded my mind.

From twenty-one to thirty, I spent the first phase of my career at the District Attorney's office;

From thirty to forty, I was the chief editor and reporter at the Silverlight City Legal Journal, gaining many awards both domestically and internationally, often forgetting to thank someone in my acceptance speeches;

From fifty to sixty, the Silverlight City Journal merged with an international Legal Journal, and I traveled to various countries, taking photos with my DSLR, always leaving a spot empty in the pictures;

From sixty to seventy, I returned to Silverlight City and opened a bookstore. I sat in a chair at the door with reading glasses, watching the sunset, forgetting whether I was reading poetry or waiting for someone;

At seventy-eight, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, with no children, living freely. I bought a house near the hospital, so if something happened, I could be rescued in time, or cremated if not.

But throughout my life, I felt something was missing, but I couldn't remember.

Oh right, someone went to get medicine for me. Oh right, I had a fever.

I lay there waiting for a long time, but that person never came.

"Sir, I'm over seventy, why haven't you come back yet?"

"Sir, you should've said goodbye when you left, or at least told me where you were going."

"Sorry, I can't call you 'sir,' I know your name. Don't worry, I'll remember."

I talked to myself, maybe because I was old, I talked a lot, forgetting what I said before.

"I feel like I know your story from somewhere, like I lived it. Others have told me, but you didn't. I'm old now, I don't blame you."

"I remember now, you were always so kind. The first time I saw you, you weren't the most handsome or the best among the guys, but you were the only one I noticed. You know why? Because everyone else avoided looking at me, but you kept smiling at me, and I smiled back."

"We should've gotten married. We could've gone to the prairie, the lake, the wheat fields, sunbathed on the haystacks. When we got tired, we could've had a baby... No, wait, we did get married. So where have you been all these years?"

Suddenly, it hit me in the wheelchair, oh right, we did get married.

He appeared, so gentle and kind, walking slowly towards me in the sunlight, squatting down and looking up at me with a smile.

I didn't know why, but my heart ached faintly. Was it because I was too old? Didn't the doctor say last time that it was Parkinson's, so how did I end up with heart disease too?

Forget it. There weren't many days left anyway.

But why was I crying? The doctor said my tear glands had degenerated.

With tears in my eyes, I touched his face and choked out, "I've been looking for you for over forty years. Where have you been all these years? Why haven't you aged? Your name is Alan, you are my husband. Over forty years ago, on the night of November 20th, there was a big fire, and you left. I will never forget that scene."

"I don't believe Laura was the culprit. The witnesses wanted her dead, but that was false testimony. No matter who it is, they can't leave without a clear explanation. I thought I had to give you an explanation, give myself an explanation, and say a proper goodbye to you."

"All these years, I've suffered so much. Why didn't you tell me?"

"How should I investigate, how should I follow the clues? I knew they were all lying, all hiding the truth, but I had no evidence."

"It's all over now, we've met, Alan."

I opened my arms and bent down to hug Alan.

The dizziness hit me again, and I fainted.

I didn't know how long it was, my whole body ached, my arms were numb, like they hadn't moved in a long time and lacked blood flow. I tried to move, my hand hurt, like something was stuck in it, and it hurt when I moved.

What was it?

I didn't know where I was or what I was doing, but my mind became much clearer.

Wasn't I at Lally's house looking at photos before I went out?

"Doctor, what is wrong with the patient? Why hasn't she woken up yet?" It was my apprentice Zoey's voice.

"Don't worry, the patient is overly tired and anxious, with poor sleep and diet, and possibly emotional stress, causing her to faint suddenly. We've done a full-body check, she's healthy, and there's nothing wrong with her brain. Just let her rest well."

"But she has been sleeping for a whole day and night, and she won't wake up no matter how I call her. Please, check again, I beg you, she can't have anything happen to her." Zoey's voice was choked with tears.

Had I really been asleep for a whole day and night?

"Rest assured, the patient's bodily functions are all normal. The nurse started giving her saline and glucose this morning. There's nothing to worry about, she should wake up today if nothing unexpected happens. Just make sure no one else disturbs her, one person to watch over her is enough."

"Thank you so much!"

"You're welcome, I'll get back to work."

###chapter 40 Daffodils

Zoey later told me that when I woke up, my eyes looked like those of an old woman in her seventies or eighties.

"What a wild metaphor," I said. "I'm in my thirties, and my wrinkles aren't that bad. How did you see me as an old lady?"

She explained that the moment I opened my eyes, the exhaustion in them wasn't something a young person should have. It was the same look her grandmother had when she was young. Her grandmother had said that at a certain age, if one looked deeply enough, they could see death, the other side, and those who had passed.

Maybe she was right. That dream felt like a whole lifetime. I was sitting in a wheelchair, looking in the mirror, with white hair and wrinkled skin.

Reality and illusion blurred together, and in the end, I saw Alan.

I pretended to be annoyed. "I'm in my thirties, and while I do have some wrinkles, I'm not that old. Call me Mrs. Smith, but we treat each other as equals. Saying I look very old is too much."

Of course, it was just a joke.

When I woke up, Zoey rushed over and hugged me, crying her eyes out. She said I had fainted near the Lally's house, and it was just in time that Benjamin and his team came by to inquire about the victim's information and got me to the hospital.

After more than ten years in the workplace, the first ten years at the prosecutor's office showed me the warmth and coldness of human relationships. I never thought that an impulsive decision would bring me to the Silverlight City Legal Journal, where I mentored Zoey for half a year and built such a deep bond.

I patted her shoulder and gently stroked her hair, comforting her softly.

Zoey cried even harder and couldn't be consoled no matter what I said.

I sighed, "Zoey, I'm hungry."

Zoey lifted her tear-streaked face and looked at me with swollen eyes. "Mrs. Smith, what do you want to eat?"

I smiled and said, "Something light. After sleeping for so long, eating too much would be hard on my stomach." Zoey agreed and quickly ran out to get some food.

Benjamin had been standing at the door for a long time. He didn't come in while Zoey was crying, not wanting to disturb the moment.

He brought a fruit basket and flowers, placing them on the table by the bed. Scratching his head, he said, "Cindy asked me to bring these. She said you like daffodils."

"Having such a apprentice is fate. Unlike my foolish apprentice, who is ignorant and ungrateful," Benjamin said self-deprecatingly.

I smiled and said, "Boys and girls express their feelings differently. Ruben respects you as his mentor very much."

"Ruben never even bought me a pack of cigarettes, let alone flowers," Benjamin rolled his eyes. "Even Cindy remembers what others like and doesn't buy me any gifts."

"I'm not that into flowers. Cindy probably thinks I like daffodils because she always sees me keeping them," I said, lowering my eyes and shaking my head slightly.

Benjamin said, "Yes, that's what Cindy said."

"That's because Alan used to give me daffodils when we were in college." I said.

Back in college, there was always a bunch of daffodils in my dorm, placed in a glass bottle. Cindy thought I liked daffodils, but it was actually Alan who kept giving them to me. At that time, we hadn't established a relationship yet. I was usually carefree, and if a boy gave me flowers that weren't roses, it meant he wasn't interested in me. It wasn't until later that I learned the language of daffodils symbolizes steadfast love and sincere expression of love.

I stared at the daffodils, lost in thought. The investigation over the past few days seemed to weave together a web of seemingly unrelated people. Zack, Lally, Duke, Frank, Bob, Laura, Mike-they all had ties to the orphanage.

What hurt the most was discovering that Lally, Duke, and Zack revered Toby, who turned out to be Alan.

Why did Lally hide Alan's name? When I left her home, I asked Lally for the name, and she said it was Toby Nelson. That was definitely a lie.

If Lally revered Alan, why did her eyes only show admiration and not a hint of sadness when she mentioned him? It didn't add up.

Thinking back to Lally's performance in court, she showed no sadness in her words or expressions. Instead, she fluently recounted the events of the case and mocked Laura.

And then there was Tammy.

In Lally's recollection, after Alan left the orphanage, he lived in Sand Village and played a significant role in Zack's adoption by Tammy and her husband. Considering the feelings and respect Tony and others had for Alan, Alan and Tammy's family must have had a close relationship.

Yet, Tammy showed no sadness in court over Alan's misfortune, directing her anger at Laura instead.

Another important question was, if Alan had a close relationship with Zack, Lally, and Duke, why didn't I see them at our wedding?

What caused the break in contact?

It shouldn't be, because Lally said that after Duke and Tony fought at Digital Leap Technologies Company, Tony came to their house the next day to warn Duke, saying if he messed up again, he would bring Zack and Alan to resolve the issue. This indicated they still had contact and maintained their friendship.

Why didn't they come to our wedding despite such a deep bond?

In contrast, I saw Alan's four close college friends at the wedding: Frank, Laura, Mike, and Bob.

Strangely, Frank's grief over Alan's death seemed genuine and heart-wrenching.

If all these people had a close relationship with Alan, their reactions were vastly different.

But if we set Alan aside, their common target seemed to be Laura.

Whether it was the people from Sand Village or the college circle, they all harbored deep resentment towards Laura. Frank even told me about his emotional entanglement with Laura, calling her a lunatic.

Frank and Laura's conflict might be personal, but what about Sand Village?

Thinking carefully, Lally, Zack, and Duke are around the same age, but they are much younger than Alan's college group, so there shouldn't be any connection. In Lally's recollection, only Alan had a close relationship with them, without mentioning the other four from the college group.

To understand the connection between Sand Village and the college group, we need to find the root cause, the orphanage.

Benjamin saw me lost in thought. With his straightforward personality, he didn't say any comforting words. He got up, poured me a glass of water, and after taking a phone call and checking the time, he prepared to leave.

"Benjamin, when you were looking into Lally and Duke's personal information, did you find out which orphanage they came from?" I asked abruptly, looking up.

###chapter 41 Layers of Obstacles

"I couldn't find it. The info on the household registration site is super vague. Silverlight City only started digitizing this stuff in the last decade or so. For special cases like theirs, they had to go to the office themselves to fill out the forms and get their IDs. It says they're from an orphanage." Benjamin thought for a moment and responded.

"So, how can we be sure they're from the same orphanage?" I asked.

"Duke mentioned it during his statement. Once he got over his drug addiction, he actually seemed human and confessed to everything he did." Benjamin spat on the ground, clearly showing his sympathy for Lally's situation.

"Wait, did you find something new in your investigation?" Benjamin asked.

"Lally and Duke both know Alan." I sighed and quickly filled Benjamin in on what I had found out in Sand Village over the past few days.

"What?" Benjamin was clearly shocked by this news. Cindy had probably told him about Alan growing up in an orphanage. With his years of experience in the police force, he quickly grasped the situation and asked, puzzled, "Are you saying that Alan also came from that orphanage, and that Lally, Duke, Tammy, Zack, and even Alan's other college friends are all somehow connected to this case?"

I nodded and said, "I want to hear your analysis."

"It seems complicated, but it can be divided into two parts. One part is Sand Village, with Lally, Tammy, Tony, and Zack as the main characters. The other part is Alan's close college friends." 

Benjamin frowned, thinking deeply. "But, Nancy, let me be blunt. What we have now are just speculations, not solid evidence. First, the three witnesses gave false testimonies, which is just your feeling. Tammy's statements were consistent. If I were Tammy, I would say that I didn't go to school, have no education, and was afraid of the court, so I wrote down the case details in advance and memorized them. There's nothing wrong with that; many witnesses do the same."

"Secondly, regarding the orphanage, the current info shows that Lally and Duke did know Alan. Even if they had a deep bond, wouldn't it be natural for Lally to testify against Laura?"

My face started to change. In Alan's case, the police, the prosecutor's office, and the court expedited the process under the pretext of 'special circumstances,' but the evidence was highly questionable, and even the witnesses gave false testimonies. Otherwise, Laura's defense attorney wouldn't have made that speech before the trial ended, leaving everyone speechless and causing the trial to be adjourned.

"Are you saying I should just accept Laura as the murderer, wait for her to be sentenced to death, and then cry at Alan's grave for justice?" I coldly looked at Benjamin and asked word by word.

"That's not what I meant. You really haven't changed a bit." Benjamin smiled bitterly, thinking of the fearless Nancy who interned at the prosecutor's office during college and later worked there, even daring to scold the chief prosecutor. 

He sighed helplessly, rubbed his tired face, and said in a deep voice, "On the contrary, I think your suspicions are entirely reasonable. The witnesses had a deep bond with Alan, yet showed no sadness in court. Meanwhile, the reactions of the people from Sand Village and Alan's college friends were different, which is also suspicious... but..."

I shouted, "What is it? Just spit it out. I'm not an outsider!"

From Benjamin's tone, it seemed he had something tough to say. Now wasn't the time for hesitation. Where was the police captain's confidence?

"Actually, after I met you that night, I went to the station to wrap up the case with my colleagues." Benjamin's eyes showed some hesitation as he slowly said, "But the colleagues involved in the case were sent to another state for training. When I went to the chief to wrap it up and check the relevant files, I was suddenly given a bunch of tasks the next day. Today at noon, I received a notice to assist in a case out of town and have to leave tomorrow. I suspect..."

"Someone is interfering with this case, keeping you from getting involved." I was shocked.

"Yeah." Benjamin nodded.

A surge of anger rose within me. I had always despised the abuse of power that undermined fairness and authority, which was why I left the prosecutor's office when Leonard had an ambiguous attitude towards it.

I never expected this case to attract such high-level interference from the police. What was the reason?

"Nancy, I said all that just to make it clear that you must gather solid evidence. Losing one Laura is nothing, but Alan's death must not remain unresolved!" Benjamin said in a deep voice, "You'll probably have to investigate this personally. If you need any help, you can call me anytime. Also, I left Ruben in Silverlight City. If you need any assistance from the police, just find him."

As he spoke, Zoey came in with breakfast, bringing an extra portion for Benjamin. Benjamin thanked her repeatedly, putting away his serious expression. It wasn't that he was wary of Zoey, but the fewer people who knew about the internal matters of the police, prosecutor's office, and court, the better. I agreed with this. If Zoey got too involved, she might be in danger herself.

Benjamin ate his breakfast, joking that he would fire Ruben tomorrow and find a new apprentice according to Zoey's standards.

Zoey laughed, blushing. "You won't find another one like me; I'm one of a kind. By the way, Mr. Wright, your boss seems to be here."

"My boss?" Benjamin was stunned, almost choking on his sandwich. "What's he doing here?"

"I don't know. He's an old man wearing a jacket like those old leaders. He asked me if I knew Benjamin and which room he was in. Isn't that your boss? Luckily, I was smart and said I didn't know, then took another elevator up." Zoey said as she took out oatmeal from a plastic bag and handed it to me.

"I'm a cop, so my boss is definitely a cop too, wearing a uniform." Benjamin looked a bit guilty, glancing at me from time to time while eating his sandwich.

"Benjamin, did you tell Leonard that I'm in a hospital?" I immediately understood through Benjamin's expression and Lally's words.

"Well, yesterday, there was some business, you know. Our police, the prosecutor's office, and the court are like a family. Then I met Mr. Williams. He asked about you, and I couldn't help it..." Benjamin stammered.

At this moment, a tired, elderly voice came from the door, "Mr. Wright, it's not fair to blame me. I remember it was you who called me yesterday afternoon."

I turned to look at the door.

Sure enough, it was Leonard Williams, the deputy chief prosecutor who had mentored me during my time at the prosecutor's office.

###chapter 42 The Invisible Hand

"Mr. Williams!" Benjamin shot up from his chair and gave a salute.

"Come on, Mr. Wright, I'm not your boss. Knock it off. Back in college, you were always stirring up trouble, chasing girls, and making a scene. You think I didn't know?" Leonard chuckled, waving his hand.

Benjamin's face blushed when Leonard brought up his past. He forced a smile and said, "But I did alright, didn't I?"

Leonard nodded and turned to Zoey, "You little rascal, you told me you didn't know him. I heard you're Nancy's apprentice. So, what do you think? Interested in joining the prosecutor's office? I can stick around for a few more years and show you the ropes. How about it? Give it some thought?"

Zoey stuck out her tongue, poured Leonard a glass of water, and grinned at me, "I'm used to my freedom. The prosecutor's office is too stifling for me."

"'Like master, like apprentice' indeed. Sadly, I've only had one apprentice, and she left as soon as she learned enough."

Leonard laughed heartily, but there was a hint of sadness in his eyes. He sighed and looked at me lying in the hospital bed, "How are you feeling? Any better?"

"Nothing serious," I said softly.

Honestly, I wasn't surprised Benjamin called Leonard, but I was shocked he came in person. Leonard was known for being stubborn and cherishing his reputation. He avoided social engagements and anything that might harm his image.

So his visit was a big surprise, even though he had mentored me. When I got married, I sent him an invitation, but he didn't come. He sent a congratulatory message instead, which was already a pleasant surprise.

The room fell silent. Zoey stuck out her tongue and found an excuse to step out and take a call. Benjamin ate his breakfast, glancing between me and Leonard, wondering if he should offer Leonard a bite, but decided against it when he saw the bite marks on the sandwich.

"I didn't bring anything," Leonard said, looking at the fruit and flowers on the table with an awkward smile.

"No worries, just bring something next time," I said calmly.

Benjamin, munching on his sandwich, widened his eyes in shock at my words. Silverlight City was the capital of West Sand State, and the deputy chief prosecutor of the Silverlight City Prosecutor's Office is undoubtedly a big shot. He was shocked that I would speak to Leonard like that.

"True," Leonard nodded.

Benjamin was even more unsettled, his eyes nearly popping out. Was this the same deputy chief prosecutor known for his fairness and strictness? He seemed more like a concerned mentor at a bedside.

"Take care of yourself. You're still young. What if you end up with a chronic condition?" Leonard sighed, looking at me. He opened his mouth as if to say something more but finally said, "I should have come sooner."

This was his apology. He hadn't come to my wedding, and after Alan's incident, I was the one who called him. It wasn't until I collapsed from exhaustion and emotional stress that he came. This was the bond between mentor and apprentice, and we both remembered it.

Back then, a corruption case involved many people from the city government, including the Forestry Bureau. They tried to pin the blame on Alan, an innocent clerk. Although he was eventually cleared, he still received a reprimand.

Leonard knew Alan was innocent but still went along with the Forestry Bureau's reprimand.

That incident was the final straw for me at the prosecutor's office. Alan was a big reason, but I also couldn't stand the injustice. Even if it had been someone else, I would have opposed Leonard's decision.

Justice and fairness were the bare minimum; we couldn't just let things slide.

Now Alan was gone, and after leaving the prosecutor's office, I found out Leonard wasn't the one calling the shots. He was under a lot of pressure too.

Plus, after the True Love Entertainment Club murder case trial, he broke his principles for the first time and gave me the case files. With those files, I started to confirm my suspicions and began my investigation.

"That incident... wasn't your fault." I looked up at my former boss and mentor, Leonard, and gave a small smile.

"How's the court handling things now? Any new evidence? When will Alan's case go to trial? No pressure, but if it's convenient, could you fill me in?" I asked.

"This case is getting weirder," Leonard adjusted his glasses and glanced at Benjamin, "Mr. Wright, there must be something unusual going on at the police department too, right?"

Benjamin replied seriously, "Yeah, all the personnel investigating Alan's case have been sent to southern cities for training and exchange programs. They won't be back for a while, and even I have to go on a business trip."

Leonard glanced at Benjamin and shook his head, "You're great at handling cases, but you lose your cool when things get tough. I bet after Nancy talked to you, you ran to the police department that very night to check things out, didn't you?"

Benjamin laughed awkwardly and nodded.

"So, even the prosecutor's office is acting strange?" I asked.

"Yes, ever since the last adjournment, the court has paused all work on this case," Leonard said, looking serious and thoughtful.

"What about Stephen?" I asked. 

Stephen was the judge in charge of criminal cases at the Silverlight City court. He was known for his diligence and fairness. With such a flimsy evidence chain and case details, he couldn't possibly stay silent.

"He's in an even worse situation than Benjamin. He was directly transferred to another city's court. Several other judges were also sent on business trips, and the prosecutors handling this case were reassigned or sent on trips right after the trial." Leonard took a sip of water from his cup and continued, "I only recently realized why they made me the notary. The prosecutor responsible for the case evidence had already been reassigned."

It seemed this case had been complicated from the start. In less than half a month, all personnel from the police, prosecutor's office, and court involved in the True Love Entertainment Club murder case had been removed, causing the case to stall.

"Is it Laura's influence? Are they planning to bail her out next?" Benjamin found the situation increasingly bizarre.

"Laura is just a theater actress. She doesn't have the power to mobilize the state court, prosecutor's office, and police department simultaneously. Besides, it would be too obvious." Leonard paused, then added, "What's strange is that despite the long delay and questionable evidence, Laura's bail application was denied."

###chapter 43 Nancy, It's Up to You

Who was pulling the strings behind all this?

Alan's case hit me like a ton of bricks in my otherwise boring life.

But for the cops, the prosecutor's office, and the court, it was just another murder case. They saw so many of these every year, it barely registered.

"What do you mean...?" I hesitated.

"It's gotta be someone high up, or they wouldn't have this kind of power." Leonard looked dead serious, nodding hard. "But I can't figure out which department or who's in charge. And I can't tell if Laura's being protected or watched. Right now, no one's allowed to visit her."

"Could it be that Laura is already..." I had a bad feeling creeping in.

"No, she's still in detention. I've seen the surveillance, she's okay."

Leonard shook his head. He'd clearly done some digging. But anyone who poked around too much got transferred or sent on business trips. Even though Leonard had some clout, he couldn't push too hard. If he got sent away, I'd lose my inside man. We couldn't rely solely on Howard's connections for this.

Howard had money and connections, sure, but favors run out. Using them came at a cost, and I knew that well.

"Seems like someone wants this to cool off, slow down, and eventually disappear," I said.

Following Leonard's logic, I started to see the bigger picture. And then what? Let it fade, and as the buzz died down, what was their next move?

If they wanted to protect Laura, they could've bailed her out and sent her abroad. Why kept her locked up?

There was only one possibility left. They didn't want Laura out. Even if the evidence was shaky and her motive unclear, they couldn't let her go. What did Laura do to make these big shots so nervous?

Was it because she was suspected of killing Alan? No, Alan had nothing to do with these big shots.

I was starting to think Laura wasn't the one who killed Alan, maybe she wasn't involved at all. It could've been a total accident.

I was curious about what Laura did to make these big shots and people from the orphanage risk making false testimonies to get her convicted.

But for me, what Laura did wasn't the main thing.

The big question was, if Laura wasn't the killer, who really killed Alan?

Thinking back to the court testimonies, the third witness, Tom, said he saw Laura go into Alan's room again and they talked about something.

But so far, the witnesses' testimonies just muddied the waters. I had a new idea.

What if all three testimonies were bogus? Let's start from scratch. Why did Alan go to the Entertainment Club in the first place?

He wouldn't just go there on a whim. Someone must've invited him. If he had invited someone, it would've been to a quieter place.

Who invited him? It had to be someone Alan knew well and hadn't seen in a while.

I tried to narrow it down and use the process of elimination.

Lally, Tammy, Duke, and Tony were out. First, they were all in Silverlight City and might've had private contact. Second, they had regular incomes and wouldn't have invited him to the Entertainment Club.

So that left his out-of-town buddies or those living the high life. Laura was out; she already said in court she wasn't the killer and didn't invite Alan.

That left Frank, Bob, Mike, and Zack, who I hadn't met yet.

Frank was easy to rule out. I'd met him, and from his reaction, it seemed like they hadn't been in touch for ages. So, that left Bob, Mike, and Zack.

If these three had motives, what would they be?

From what I'd gathered, their bond wasn't just as college buddies but also as childhood friends from the orphanage. They were tight. No mortal enemies here.

Plus, they all pointed fingers at Laura, clearly holding a grudge against her, not Alan.

There was another possibility. What if it was a setup? But I quickly dismissed that. Laura's lawyer wasn't a slouch. If it was a simple frame-up, it would've been exposed in court.

The more I thought about it, the more tangled it got. The suspects seemed to be drifting away from Alan. There was only one way to go.

Their relationships seemed complicated, but they all started from one place, the orphanage.

If I could figure out their initial relationships, maybe everything would click. Not only could I understand the ties between them and Laura, but I also had a hunch one of them knew who really killed Alan. Or maybe there was a natural link between these two events.

After hashing out the theories about Laura's case, I fell into deep thought, constantly deducing and eliminating until my furrowed brows gradually relaxed.

"Looks like we've got a lead," Leonard said, relieved.

I nodded, knowing he was proud of me, his apprentice. He knew my thinking and judging habits well.

I then filled Leonard in on the info I'd gathered over the past few days, including the relationships between Alan and these people. During this time, Zoey came back. Seeing we weren't done talking, she was about to leave again, but I called her over to listen. Zoey had always been concerned about Alan's case, and there was no need to keep her out. It would also help her career.

Plus, I needed help. The people I could rely on and trust were almost all in this room.

After sharing my thoughts, the room fell into deep thought again.

"Nancy, you're the victim's family, yet you can look past Laura's suspect label and actively investigate the real killer. I'm very pleased."

Leonard's eyes were a bit teary. As his former apprentice, he was undoubtedly proud of my growth. "I agree with your theory. The real killer of Alan and the grudge against Laura seem like two separate matters, but they might be connected. The orphanage is the key. Meanwhile, the big hand behind the case might reveal itself. When that happens, no matter how high up they are or the cost, I'll bring them to justice!"

He sighed deeply and said solemnly, "Nancy, this case depends on you both publicly and privately. Benjamin's been transferred out of Silverlight City. I can't openly investigate, but I'll give you all the help I can in secret."

Zoey squeezed my hand and said loudly, "And me!"

Just then, Benjamin got a call. His face went pale. After hanging up, he said gravely, "I just got a call. Lally is missing."

###chapter 44 Lally's Disappearance

Upon hearing this news, I wanted to leave the hospital immediately.

Leonard, Zoey, and Benjamin were all like, "Nancy, you should really chill here for a couple more days and see how you're doing." After all, I had been out cold for a whole day and night, and if something went south with my health, the whole plan could go up in smoke.

After thinking it over, I figured I'd stay put for one more day and, if everything checked out, I'd bounce the next day.

But I couldn't just sit around doing nothing. Ruben told me Lally was missing-her phone was off, no one was home, and her packed bags were still there. No signs of a struggle, so it didn't look like a kidnapping.

Benjamin was heading out of Silverlight City tomorrow and had some stuff to handle at the police station. He left the job of finding Lally to Ruben, who'd keep me in the loop. After that, Benjamin took off in a hurry.

Leonard left not long after. Before he did, I told him to be careful at work. He was always super cautious and avoided social events, but when it came to business, he'd go all out, no matter who he was up against. I worried his fiery temper might get him into trouble.

I wanted Zoey to get back to work at the company, but she said she had already arranged to work remotely and that sticking with me for the case counted as work.

I couldn't help but smile. Zoey was sharp and always found a way to make things work. 

Just then, Howard called. Zoey had told him about my hospital stay when she asked for leave. He was concerned and said he was cool with Zoey working with me, with her pay staying the same. He also mentioned the Alan case and said I shouldn't hesitate to ask for help if needed. He acknowledged my big contributions to the Silverlight City Legal Journal's success over the years and said he couldn't forget my efforts, or he'd feel guilty.

It didn't sound like something a boss would say; it felt more like a buddy looking out for me.

Zoey, listening in, smiled and said, "Our boss really gets it, huh?"

"Quit joking. Using my situation as an excuse to slack off, you haven't even started working, and you've already learned all the tricks. I didn't teach you that," I said, pretending to be mad.

Zoey hugged me and said playfully, "Mrs. Smith, can't I pick up a few things on my own? I'm worried about you. Even if I were at the office, I'd still be thinking about you. It's better to be here; I'll get more done."

Seeing Zoey's dark circles, my heart ached.

Benjamin had mentioned earlier that after I passed out, he and the others were at Lally's place for inquiries and rushed me to the hospital. The police were short-staffed and couldn't spare anyone to stay with me, so they called Zoey for help.

Zoey hadn't slept for a day and a night.

Feeling a wave of warmth, I hugged Zoey and said softly, "Why don't you take a nap? Let's rest up and then tackle this together."

Zoey nodded, chatted with me for a bit, then found a bed and crashed. She was wiped out.

I closed my eyes to rest and started planning our next moves.

With Lally's mysterious disappearance, I initially worried that Duke might have been kidnapped by someone he owed money to because of his drug habit. But Ruben said it didn't look like a kidnapping, and she might have left on her own. I felt a bit relieved, hoping no more bad luck would hit this troubled girl.

The more likely scenario was that she was hiding to dodge the investigation.

Could she have figured out who I am?

Nah, I doubt it. In court, she didn't even glance my way, and I was rocking sunglasses and different clothes that day. No way she recognized me. Even if she saw a photo, she wouldn't connect the dots. I remember, even though I was a mess emotionally, I gave a reason for leaving, and Lally saw me out the door.

I had a hunch someone tipped Lally off about who I was. This person must've known what I was up to and pieced together my identity.

So far, I'd interacted with Frank, Tammy, Lally, Duke, and Tony's wife, Anna.

Anna... It hit me that after Tony got home, Tammy and Anna probably told him about my visit, and I had left my business card. Tony could easily dig up who I was with a bit of effort!

Damn! I regretted trying to help Tony with the compensation case and handing my card to those two.

With Lally missing, I had forgotten to ask for the orphanage's name before leaving in my emotional state.

It looked like I needed to prioritize investigating Tony. Finding him could give me info about the orphanage and maybe even Lally's whereabouts.

But this was just a theory for now; I needed to confirm it.

With that in mind, I grabbed my phone, found Anna's number, and called her. The phone rang a few times before she picked up.

"Hey, Anna. It's Nancy from Silverlight City Legal Journal. Are you busy right now?" I asked.

"Oh, Nancy! Not at all. I was just thinking of calling you but didn't want to bother you." Anna sounded really happy on the other end.

"Is it about Tony working at Silverlight City Legal Journal?"

"Yes, Nancy. I'm so sorry to trouble you with this."

Anna was still hung up on this. I smiled a bit. She was good with words, making it seem like I was the one concerned, putting me in a spot where I couldn't back out.

"Yeah, I just talked to our HR. They said Tony's resume looks solid, and we're looking to expand into new media. We need someone reliable and experienced, so we'd like Tony to come in for an interview tomorrow. I'll be there too." I added that I'd be there, hinting that if Tony showed up, the job was pretty much his.

"Great, thank you so much, Nancy. I'll call Tony right away to make sure he's available."

A little while later, Anna called back, sounding apologetic. "Nancy, I'm really sorry, but could we push it back a couple of days?"

I had a feeling my suspicion was right. "What's up? Something going on at home?"

"Everything's fine at home. It's just that Tony said he's super busy at work lately. He can make time around noon tomorrow. Would that work for you?"

"As long as everything's good at home. What time does Tony leave for work and come back? I'll see if we can fit it in during his lunch break."

"He leaves around 9 AM and starts work at 10. He has an hour and a half for lunch, but it might be a bit tight."

"Yeah, I get it. Let me talk to HR and see if we can find another time this week." Then I hung up.

This was the second time setting up an interview with Tony. The first time might've been because he was busy, but the second time was definitely him dodging me!

After I left that day, Lally probably contacted Tony and told him what went down.

I was now sure Tony had figured out who I was.

I asked about Tony's work hours to tail him. If he wasn't going to work, what was he up to every day?

Could Lally be with him?

No more hiding; it was time to take charge!

###chapter 45 George

It was 8 a.m. in Sand Village.

The young guys, still groggy, bought the cheapest breakfast, slung their bags over their shoulders, and hurried towards the bus stop.

People saw this place differently. Some observed the hustle and bustle, some added it to their culinary map, while others deemed it dirty and chaotic, refusing to set foot there.

After hearing Lally and Duke's stories, seeing Tony's family's situation, and learning that Alan used to live here, I felt a weird connection to this place.

Sand Village, or the inner-city village, was like the backdrop of the city's history and memory, and also the battleground for young outsiders' destinies.

I read somewhere that every young person with city dreams who came to Silverlight City spent a year or two in the inner-city village.

It was dirty, chaotic, and fraught with safety hazards, especially for girls, but the rent was cheap enough to be worth it.

This was the cradle of dreams, the starting point of everything, and then, nothing more. Most people quietly left under the city's bright lights, unnoticed.

Silverlight City was the capital of West Sand State, serving as the economic hub of the entire northwest region, but its rapid growth had only occurred in the past twenty years.

In the past twenty years, with the advantages of the era and its strategic location, countless business miracles and successful individuals emerged here. They all spoke of their struggles, shared their secrets to success, and inspired young people to strive diligently.

Success was rare, and few could remain. Silverlight City's achievements today were the result of the silent hard work of those young people who lived in the inner-city village, unable to afford heating in winter and hesitant to turn on the air conditioning in summer.

This "anti-elite" thinking seemed out of place nowadays. I chuckled to myself, bought a sandwich and milk at the breakfast shop.

Taking a bite of the sandwich and a sip of milk, I ate while watching the entrance of Tony's alley, waiting for someone to come out.

"Miss, you don't look like someone who lives here. Watching you keep looking towards the alley, you look more like a cop." The shop owner joked while making breakfast.

I was taken aback. The breakfast shop owner, with graying hair, looked about sixty years old and seemed very talkative. Curiously, I asked, "Sir, you're joking. What cop? I'm just waiting for someone. How did you tell I'm not from here?"

"That question just proves it even more." The breakfast shop owner laughed and pointed to the people around, "I've been selling breakfast here for almost twenty years. No one who buys breakfast stays here for more than a minute, and you're the first."

"Well, you have a good eye. If you weren't selling breakfast, you could be a detective, solving big cases." I joked.

Without being thoroughly familiar with the environment and the people here, one would not observe such details. Those who lived in this area were always thinking about how to move out from the very first day. Naturally, they were busy rushing to work and making money, leaving them no leisure time to stand around here.

"If I were a cop, I'd spend my days making sandwiches for them. How could I possibly solve big cases?" The breakfast shop owner laughed heartily, seemingly pleased with his observation, looked me up and down, and said mysteriously, "I think you're special!"

"How so?" I raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"You drove here, right?" The breakfast shop owner pointed to the Audi parked not far away, smiling, "That car isn't something people here can afford."

"And you've been scoping out the place since you got your breakfast. Let me guess, just like in those novels, right? Private detective! High income! Am I close?" The breakfast shop owner lowered his voice, grinning.

I noticed his phone playing an audiobook, something about suspense and mystery. I shook my head and smiled, "You're not too far off. Detectives dig up info, and we journalists dig into the meaning behind it."

"A journalist? Here, have an egg on the house!"

The breakfast shop owner, being super friendly, started to put an egg in a plastic bag. I thanked him and politely declined.

"No, thank you. I'm here to do a piece on the inner-city village, looking for some inspiration."

I made up a reason. Since he knew this place well, he should know about the events in Sand Village over the years, including Tony's family and the orphanage. According to Lally's recollection, the orphanage should be nearby.

"Haha, ask away, just no filming. I'm kind of a big deal in Sand Village, gotta keep up appearances." The breakfast shop owner said, touching his graying hair. At his age, such humor was rare. I chuckled and assured him I was alone, no camera in sight.

"You said you've been selling breakfast here for 20 years. Are you from Sand Village?"

"Yep, this storefront is ours. When the steel mill closed and relocated, they owed us three years' wages, so they gave us this storefront instead. We thought it was a loss at the time, but had no choice. Later, we started selling breakfast ourselves, and business was okay." The breakfast shop owner said earnestly.

Silverlight City had been expanding non-stop. This place was originally called Sand Town, with a nearby steel mill. When the mill closed and relocated, most employees didn't follow and stayed in Sand Village.

"Didn't you think about moving with the mill? I heard the steel mill did well after relocating."

I checked the time, around 8:20 a.m., still early. I chatted with the breakfast shop owner while keeping an eye on the alley entrance, gathering more info.

"You can't just go where the money is, right?" The breakfast shop owner's voice rose when talking about the mill's relocation, with a hint of pride, "Nowadays, people chase money, going wherever it is. Back then, we workers had to learn from role models, learn to be advanced! Like our foreman, who was advanced every year, always putting the workers' benefits first. When the mill relocated, the director personally asked the foreman to go, offering housing and shares. Think about it, how much money that was. Our foreman said no, he wanted to stay and achieve something with his team. With the foreman saying that, how could we say no? So we all stayed!"

Seeing the breakfast shop owner suddenly passionate, I nodded. That era was indeed full of enthusiasm. My dad used to work overtime at the construction institute, always full of energy, feeling hopeful every day. I later asked him if it was family pressure or something else. He said family was part of it, but more importantly, there was a drive inside, a sense of hope every day. That was the unique romance of that era.

"From what you said, that foreman indeed had great charisma." I agreed.

"Of course! Even though Mr. Thompson has been dead for years, if you ask the old folks in Sand Village about him, no one would hesitate to praise him. If they do, I'll give you my shop!" The breakfast shop owner said proudly, patting his chest.

"Are there many Thompsons in this village?" I asked.

"Just one family, George Thompson's, in the alley you were looking at." The breakfast shop owner replied.

###chapter 46 A Great Fire

That was right, George was most likely Tony's father.

A while back, when I went to Tammy's place for an interview, I saw his picture and did some quick math. The timing lined up.

Since the breakfast stall guy knew so much about Tony's dad, he probably knew a lot about Tony and Zack too. And about George's death, Tammy never mentioned it at all. This family always gave off a weird vibe.

"You just said he passed away? I think Mr. Thompson's story could be part of a series on the history of the inner-city village. If it gets picked, there'll be some compensation." I gently probed, trying to learn more about their family.

"I don't want money!" The breakfast stall guy waved his hand and shook his head. "Promoting Mr. Thompson is the biggest help you can give us. Mr. Thompson was diligent and quick-witted. We didn't have much education, but Mr. Thompson could understand things at a glance and do them right. When he was elected foreman, none of the workers were unhappy. Following Mr. Thompson, everyone felt motivated!"

I nodded silently. To have such strong cohesion and appeal, and to be talked about so fondly even after so many years, was truly remarkable. Unconsciously, I thought of Alan again. Wasn't he the same?

"Mr. Thompson was not only good at his job but also a great person. After he became foreman, some people privately said that Mr. Thompson had been pretending for so many years and now that he finally made it, he would surely embezzle some money. But Mr. Thompson didn't. When Sand Village was distributing houses, Mr. Thompson chose a small house. When the company gave out benefits, he let everyone take theirs first. The extra bonuses during holidays were all openly accounted for and basically evenly distributed. Mr. Thompson was like a scale, fair and just. Neighbors with conflicts would go to him for mediation, and everyone was convinced in the end!" As he spoke, the breakfast stall guy looked desolate, took out a cigarette, lit it, and said slowly, "It's a pity, good people don't live long."

"Was Mr. Thompson murdered?" I asked.

"No," the breakfast stall guy replied.

Seeing that there wasn't much business, the breakfast stall guy moved a chair and sat down, sighing with resentment. "Mr. Thompson and his wife didn't have kids for a long time. Later, they adopted one. Unexpectedly, within a year, his wife got pregnant. The adopted child was treated like their own son. He was sensible, smart, and good at studying, and the neighbors liked him. The second child wasn't as smart as the first, seemed a bit dull, but was very obedient."

The eldest the breakfast stall guy mentioned seemed to be Zack, and the second was Tony. I nodded and let him continue.

"Mr. Thompson was a good man. A few years later, he adopted a little girl. Now, with a family of five, life was lively."

Things started to seem off. Tammy's family only had two kids, so who was the third? I vaguely felt that George's death wasn't simple.

"So how did Mr. Thompson die?" I asked.

The breakfast stall guy fell silent, his eyes showing a trace of sorrow. After a long time, he said in a low voice, "A big fire. He and his daughter didn't make it."

"His daughter was different from his sons, very wild. She would run out all day and even not come home at night. One time, it was two or three in the morning, and she still wasn't back. Mr. Thompson and his wife were worried, took a flashlight, and called out for her throughout the village but couldn't find her. They knocked on doors asking about her whereabouts. Later, they heard she was found near the old steel factory's gasoline warehouse."

"The warehouse caught fire. Mr. Thompson rushed in to save her, but neither he nor his daughter made it out," the breakfast stall guy sighed deeply. "Since then, Mr. Thompson's wife lived with the two boys. She was tough. Even when neighbors offered help, she refused, saying Mr. Thompson always helped others without expecting anything in return. If she accepted help, she wouldn't be able to face Mr. Thompson in the afterlife."

Thinking about Tammy's sorrowful expression when looking at George's photo, losing her husband and refusing neighbors' help, every day of these years must have been pure torment.

"But the hardships didn't end there for Mr. Thompson's family. As his two sons grew up, the eldest went to college, and the second went to a technical school. Especially the eldest, who did well after graduation, had money and status. Who would have thought he would do such a despicable thing? He wanted to demolish Sand Village. Sure, the villagers were a bit greedy, wanting more compensation, but they were all their own people. They could have sat down and talked it out. This bastard had his brother beaten up, damaging his reproductive organs. Mr. Thompson adopted this bastard, did good deeds all his life, and ended up with his son being childless! Is this something a human would do?"

The breakfast stall guy spat angrily. "If I see that bastard, I'll skin him alive. How could he do this to Mr. Thompson and that family?"

"And... what about Mr. Thompson's second son?" I asked.

The key person was still him. I didn't think Tony was as dull and introverted as people said. On the contrary, he was very alert. So far, I seemed to be in the open, and he was in the dark.

"Tony is a good person. After the incident, he didn't even curse Zack. We thought Zack would be more successful than Tony, but now it seems Tony might be the family's blessing. Despite his condition, Tony found a wife. I even attended their wedding. His wife is a few years younger than him, capable and beautiful. Even without children, they could adopt one and live a good life." The breakfast stall guy finally smiled, seemingly satisfied with Tony.

It seemed he didn't know about Anna's affair with another man. And I just remembered, Lally mentioned before that Anna married Tony after he became disabled.

I had a long-standing doubt. Why did Anna choose to marry Tony? She was young, beautiful, and had a complicated relationship with an investor from Digital Leap Technologies Company. Her financial situation should be good. Even if she wanted to marry, Tony wouldn't be her choice. Why did she live in Sand Village?

Recalling Anna asking me to help Tony find a job at the company, it seemed they had a genuine emotional foundation. Could it be true love? But Anna seemed very shrewd in our interactions. Would a beautiful young woman at her age take love seriously?

I couldn't figure it out. This family always gave me a strange feeling. Their tragic fate was undeniable, but Tony and Zack were shrouded in too much mystery. They seemed unrelated to the Entertainment Club murder case. Tony had an alibi for the night of the murder, and although Zack wasn't directly connected, Tammy had included his name in the insurance policy.

I suddenly thought of a question. The copy of the insurance policy had nothing to do with the Sand Village demolition case. How did it end up in the office files?

Thinking of this, I exchanged a few pleasantries with the breakfast stall guy and then returned to my car to call Zoey. She was already at the office. I asked about the company's investigation of the demolition case, which was also in late December 2019.

But the problem was, the demolition fight happened in December 2019. Silverlight City Journal investigated, collected, and archived the information.

Why did the insurance policy copy provided to Tammy in 2020 appear here?

Moreover, I had Zoey confirm that the insurance policy copy was clearly updated, looking like it was placed there recently.

I suddenly felt an inexplicable fear. Someone had been guiding me in this investigation all along.

###chapter 47 Waiter

The company archive room was right next to my office. Ever since I had arrived, all the case files had been digitized and uploaded to the computer, so hardly anyone visited the archive room anymore. So, why was there suddenly an extra copy of this document?

Who brought this copy in? It was like someone knew I'd be looking into the Sand Village demolition case.

I thought about who in the company could access this case. Besides Howard and Zoey, there was no one else, and those two had no reason to do this; they could have just handed it to me directly.

I took a deep breath and thought it over. Even without this insurance policy, I had already noticed something fishy from the witnesses' statements during the initial court trial. I started digging into these witnesses, and even without this policy, I would still have suspected Tony.

But this insurance policy jogged my memory and reminded me of my original line of thought. Tony blew all of his $500,000 compensation on this $2 million policy. Even if Zack had more money, the remaining $1.5 million he invested was no small change. He must have known Tony's motive.

If Tony's big investment was tied to this case four years later, then he must be involved.

Therefore, the greatest significance of this insurance policy lay here: Zack also had a significant connection to this case.

Lally's disappearance, the elusive Zack, the history of Sand Village, and the kids from the orphanage-all these people were tangled up with Tony.

Maybe finding Tony would uncover more hidden secrets.

As I was thinking, a guy wearing a helmet rode a motorcycle out of the alley. The motorcycle stalled after a few steps.

The moment the guy took off his helmet, I recognized him. Yep, it was Tony. His photo was on the resume Anna gave me earlier.

It was already December, and winter had set in. He was wearing a black cotton jacket, squatting on the ground to check the motorcycle engine, scratching his head and looking around like he couldn't figure out the problem. The motorcycle looked old, a model from over a decade ago, so it was bound to have issues.

I glanced at the time, 9:10 AM, ten minutes past the commuting time Anna mentioned.

After a while, the motorcycle started again. Tony put on his helmet and rode out of the alley.

I followed slowly in my car. Anna didn't know that Tony had left Digital Leap Technologies Company, but Tony still followed his regular work schedule. What was he doing every day, and was Lally's disappearance related to him?

I followed Tony, keeping a safe distance and being cautious. When Tony was fixing his motorcycle, I took out my phone and snapped a picture of his license plate: [SilverlightD·K6329].

In case I lost him, I could ask Ruben to contact the traffic police to search for the recent driving records of this motorcycle.

Luckily, the half-hour drive had no turns, and I followed him smoothly without losing him. There were other vehicles on the road, so he probably wouldn't notice me.

A few minutes later, Tony's motorcycle stopped near the CBD area.

This area had the largest shopping mall in the northern suburbs, called Stellar Plaza. It was newly built in recent years and was quite popular, with many social media influencers coming to take photos and hang out.

I drove slowly, observing through the car window. After parking his motorcycle, Tony greeted an employee coming out of Stardust Diner and walked straight in.

Did he work at Stardust Diner?

There were no other businesses on that floor besides Stardust Diner. Although Anna didn't know Tony had left his previous job, he still needed to work and earn an income. Otherwise, where would the money come from?

Thinking about this, I called up a buddy at the state employment department and asked if they could check the employee records at Stellar Plaza's Stardust Diner. I sent over Tony's details.

Ten minutes later, my friend called back. Tony was indeed working at Stellar Plaza's Stardust Diner, as a waiter since May this year.

The timeline fit perfectly. Tony started at Stardust Diner right after leaving Digital Leap Technologies Company.

Feeling relieved, I stepped on the gas and headed back to the office. Now that I knew where Tony worked, there was no rush to confront him. I needed to figure out who had slipped Tammy's insurance policy copy into the files.

When I pulled up at the office, Zoey was already there, waving at me with a coffee in hand, looking all excited.

Zoey had wanted to come to Sand Village with me this morning, but I was worried something might go wrong if we both went, so I asked her to head to the office first. I had already filled her in on my way back.

"Mrs. Smith, how did it go? Any progress?" Zoey asked, handing me the coffee.

"I found out where Tony works," I replied.

"Mrs. Smith, I told you there was no danger in following Tony, but you still didn't let me go," Zoey pouted, looking a bit miffed.

I put my arm around her shoulder and walked towards the office. "To make it up to you, how about I treat you to lunch at Stardust Diner? Then in the afternoon, we can inform HR and go together."

Since Tony had been found, there was no danger in going there. It was better to bring Zoey along rather than have her worry in the office. After all, she was my assistant, and when I wasn't around, Zoey seemed to be idle in the office. Others seemed hesitant to give her tasks, probably because of my usual work style.

"Mrs. Smith, you usually don't like going to Stardust Diner, saying the food is average. How about we choose another restaurant?" Zoey was speaking when her eyes suddenly lit up as she realized, "Tony works at Stardust Diner!"

"Smart!" I said.

"Of course, I'm your apprentice!" Zoey said proudly, then her face fell. "Mrs. Smith, I thought you were really making it up to me."

"How about a three-scoop Haagen-Dazs and a venti Starbucks cold brew?" I said, looking at Zoey's gray coat. "Your birthday is coming up. How about we look for a dress in moss green to match your coat? It would look stylish and vibrant, just like you."

"Yay!"

Zoey had been with me for a long time, and her birthday was coming up, so it was the perfect time to give her a gift.

When I arrived at the office, I found Howard there. He was surprised to see me and quickly called me to his office to ask about the case.

I hadn't seen him for a while as he had been on business trips. He had just returned last night. After I briefed him on the situation, Howard nodded and said he had met another witness, Tom, at the airport last night.

Tom had also just returned from a business trip. They knew each other from before, and since I had asked Howard to investigate Tom, they decided to have dinner next week, though the exact time wasn't set yet.

Howard briefly mentioned Tom's background, which he hadn't detailed over the phone. 

Tom was a senior executive in urban investment planning, whom Howard had met at a business salon. He had business dealings with Frank. Speaking of Frank, Howard asked if we should contact him again since he was currently in Silverlight City.

I thought about it and decided to first investigate the people from the orphanage. Frank's matter could wait. Although they came from the same orphanage, according to Lally's recollection, Alan was the one who was close to them. Frank, being a few years older, probably didn't play with them as kids, so their relationship wasn't as close.

###chapter 48 He Recognizes Me!

"Hey, has anyone been in the company archives room lately?" I suddenly remembered and decided to ask Howard.

"If you hadn't mentioned it, I would've forgotten that place even existed. Besides, you know how rarely I come to the office. Isn't that your domain?" Howard shrugged. 

Made sense; ever since I joined, he'd been more of a hands-off manager, spending his time visiting clients and negotiating deals.

The company archives room was basically a storage room with a glass door and a combination lock. In theory, only employees could get in, and outsiders were kept out.

But after asking around, everyone said they hadn't been in the archives room this year.

When I opened the door, the room was pretty big, with four rows of shelves stacked with documents. The top layer was dusty, showing it hadn't been touched in ages.

Zoey mentioned she found the materials for the Sand Village demolition brawl case on the bottom of the third shelf. I squatted down to look but couldn't find any traces since the scene had already been disturbed when the documents were taken out, leaving no clues.

And since the company didn't have surveillance cameras, all chances of tracking down leads were completely cut off, so this clue had to be temporarily abandoned.

Regardless, the appearance of the insurance policy was a positive influence on the current case, and that was a good thing.

Since it was lunchtime, I ran into Howard in the parking lot and told him I was taking Zoey to lunch.

Howard looked excited when he saw I was taking Zoey to lunch and was ready to get in the car, but when he heard it was Stardust Diner, he made a face and said he couldn't handle Mexican food at his age and would find something to eat on his own downstairs.

Zoey laughed and said she'd bring him some snacks from Stardust Diner, reminiscing about her college days eating Mexican food with her dad.

That was when I found out that Zoey's father and Howard were college classmates. Zoey saw my surprised expression and said, "Mrs. Smith, you didn't know about my relationship with Mr. Martin until now?"

I replied while driving, "If all the intern reporters who have a good relationship with Mr. Martin were as excellent as you, I wouldn't mind having a few more."

"Well, there aren't any more. I'm the only one this excellent. Mr. Martin approached my dad about my internship, saying the company needed someone, and the chief editor here is amazing, so I came to intern for a year."

Zoey didn't mind talking about it, but she seemed a bit reluctant when it came to her father. "Mr. Martin is repaying a favor. My dad is also in law enforcement. When Howard started Silverlight City Legal Journal, my dad helped with some cases that regular reporters couldn't get information on. Of course, it was all above board, not bribery or anything... Mrs. Smith, you understand, my dad is an old-fashioned guy and wouldn't do anything like that!"

Thinking back to when Zoey said she'd never marry a detective, and hearing that her father was also in law enforcement, it was likely he was a detective too, which would explain the infrequent family gatherings and some inevitable complaints.

"When I first started working, my relationship with my dad wasn't great either." Zoey's like a little sister to me, so I wanted to give her some advice on father-daughter stuff.

"I'd love to have a fight with my dad, but we barely see each other all year, so there's nothing to fight about. We've been living apart for years..." Zoey wrinkled her nose, looking a bit upset, but quickly bounced back and said, "My dad and I have a good relationship. He even called about my internship, though it was less than a minute... But if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you."

Zoey didn't bring it up again, and I didn't push. Family stuff was personal, and there'd be plenty of chances to talk about it later. Zoey had mentioned more than once that she wanted to intern at Silverlight City Journal after graduation and wasn't planning to go anywhere else, so there'd be plenty of time.

Since it was lunchtime, Stellar Plaza was packed, so I made a reservation ahead of time. After parking in the underground lot, I bought Zoey some Haagen-Dazs and Starbucks before heading to Stardust Diner.

Stardust Diner was known for its top-notch service, but I'd only been there once, with Alan.

When Stardust Diner first opened, I dragged Alan there because I love Mexican food. The experience felt like being in prison:

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with an overwhelming welcome that startled us. They prepared our utensils, brought us milk, snacks, and hot towels, and quickly wiped the table if there was a spot of oil. Calling for a waiter resulted in an overly enthusiastic response, which felt jarring. They even stood by our table watching us eat...

I couldn't handle it, and Alan, who prefered peace and quiet, frowned the entire time. We left within half an hour.

Sure enough, as soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a loud "Welcome to Stardust Diner," and two waiters in Stardust Diner uniforms rushed over.

I couldn't handle this kind of situation, feeling like I was paying to suffer. Zoey, on the other hand, chatted and laughed with the waiters as they led us to our reserved table.

I had specifically chosen a spot in the lower left corner of the main hall, where we could see most of the hall and the private rooms. Not long after, Zoey nudged me and pointed, and I saw Tony, wearing a Stardust Diner uniform, smiling as he seated guests.

This was the first time I had seen Tony up close. Unlike the other staff's trained smiles, his seemed genuine, as if he truly enjoyed the lively atmosphere. He was enthusiastically introducing dishes to the guests using an iPad.

Soon, Tony walked over to us.

"Hello, ladies. What would you like to eat?" He poured Zoey a cup of hot milk and gently said, "It's getting colder, so be careful not to upset your stomach with too much iced coffee and ice cream. Drink something warm first."

"Thank you, sir." Zoey showed no signs of nervousness and replied with a smile.

I took the menu from Tony and ordered some classic Mexican dishes.

"Great choices!" Tony gave a thumbs up. "My brother used to love these dishes too!" Then he picked up his walkie-talkie and said, "Boss, I haven't used my free meal yet, right? Please comp table 101."

I was stunned, and Tony's next words made me shiver. "It's nothing. It's our first meeting, so it's on me. Actually, I should call you Mrs. Smith."

###chapter 49 Performance and Reality

I had played out a million ways meeting Tony could go down, and I even had this gut feeling he was dodging me.

But I never thought he'd spot me right away. And from the way he acted all cool, it was clear he knew I'd been tailing him that morning.

Zoey was totally thrown off by this sudden address and all the info that came with it. She looked a bit rattled but quickly pulled herself together, smiled, glanced at me, and figured it was best if I took the lead.

"Hey, Tony, nice to meet you. I'm Nancy Johnson," I said with a smile.

I had a ton of questions swirling in my head, but with this face-to-face, I didn't even know where to start. Since he already knew I was onto him, might as well just lay it all out there.

"Doesn't seem like the best time to chat," I said, eyeing Tony in his work uniform and pointing to the seat across from us. "The service here at Stardust Diner is top-notch. Why don't you take a break and join us for a bit?"

Tony shrugged and gave a wry smile, "If you want to see me get canned, Mrs. Smith, go ahead. Jobs are hard to come by these days. If I can't bring home a paycheck, you've met my wife, her temper's no joke."

So, he knew I had met Anna, which meant he was aware I was digging into his life. But how did he recognize me? My business card didn't have a photo, and the company website had my profile but no picture.

"Don't worry, I won't tell Anna you're slacking," I said calmly.

Tony let out a sigh of relief, patted his chest, and shook his head, "Toby's never wrong. Mrs. Smith, you're a good person. Just order the food for now. If it's not enough, call me anytime. I get off work at 10 PM, but I guess you can't wait that long. I'll take a break around 6 PM, and we can find a nearby café to chat."

"No rush, I'll wait until you're off," I gently declined.

Since he came to find me, it meant he wasn't going to hide anymore. No need to rush. His life wasn't easy, and taking a break would mean a pay cut. How much could a Stardust Diner waiter make in a month anyway?

"Mrs. Smith, you're too kind. It's fine, I have a lot to talk to you about." Tony grabbed the iPad and hurried off to serve other customers.

Zoey let out a long breath after he walked away, took a few gulps of coffee, and kept saying, "That freaked me out. Mrs. Smith, you're so calm. When he called you Mrs. Smith, I was stunned. I was trying to think of a way to stall."

"Come on, stop flattering me. And by the way, your acting skills still need some work... I saw through you right away."

"No way, Mrs. Smith, you're the best!"

Zoey must had noticed that I also got flustered just now. After Tony left, she tried to lighten the mood. But Zoey was too over the top. Where did she pick up this workplace experience?

I couldn't hold it in earlier, and there was no need to hide it in front of Zoey.

Winter in Silverlight City was freezing, and the glass windows were fogged up from the warmth inside the restaurant.

Soon, the waiter brought the hot pot and dishes.

Zoey also ordered an extra iced cola. Ice cream, iced coffee, iced cola-Zoey was happily munching and humming, not forgetting to give me some food.

"In winter, drinking so many cold things and eating Mexican food, be careful of stomach issues."

I poured Zoey a cup of hot milk, which I had specially requested from the waiter earlier. Mainly because I couldn't stand the overly enthusiastic service at Stardust Diner.

They didn't really care about what you needed; they just put on this big show of being super enthusiastic and caring. That fake concern was something I could definitely do without.

Zoey was munching away, her mouth all greasy, and she mumbled, "Mrs. Smith, if you don't drink iced Starbucks coffee, it's like drinking bad medicine. And don't Thalassia people do this? Wearing coats in winter and holding iced coffee. Thalassia male celebrities are pretty hot."

Seeing her so happy with her food, my mood lifted. It was like watching my little sister eat. I teased her, "Weren't you into Vesperia-style guys? When did it switch to Thalassia-style? Let me think, right, Benjamin's apprentice Ruben might not be your dream guy, but if he tries hard to nail that Thalassia look, there's still hope."

"No way, Mrs. Smith, I'll stick to hot drinks," Zoey pouted and made a face. "I think Ruben should ditch being a detective and get into making funny videos. He's a natural. Haha, thinking about that day still cracks me up."

Talking about Ruben reminded me of how Benjamin left him with me before he took off, saying I could ask him for anything. 

That night, I added him on Facebook, and he messaged me three times a day: [Mrs. Smith, remember to call me if you need anything. Mrs. Smith, anything you need today? Mrs. Smith, do you need my help?]

Zoey and I were chowing down on Mexican food while chatting about Tony. I gave her the lowdown on Tony's situation, including his relationship with Anna and her affairs on the side.

Zoey was floored, her eyes wide open. "This is like a tragic second male lead in a novel. My God, there are really people this unlucky in real life."

"Why do you say that?" I didn't read romance novels much.

"In those novels, the main guy has it easy, while the second male lead's life is a mess. Betrayed by lovers, ditched by friends, all alone, and it usually ends badly for them. They either turn evil or end up dead." Zoey thought for a moment and summed up the plot of those stories.

Life was more vivid and wild than stories. Based on what I knew about Tony, Zoey's take made some sense.

"So, in the early stages of the story, what keeps him going through all the bad stuff?" I asked.

"Two things." Zoey held up two fingers, not forgetting to take a bite of ice cream. "Emotions and hatred. Usually, these two are all mixed up. When someone's mental world falls apart, they go bad."

As she was talking, we suddenly heard someone singing a birthday song not far away.

Tony was leading two waiters, singing with gusto. A couple was celebrating their kid's birthday at Stardust Diner.

The other two were half-heartedly dancing, but Tony was all in, singing and dancing with tons of energy, which seemed different from the Tony I had just met or heard about.

He was beaming, occasionally interacting with the kid.

If anyone else saw this, they'd think this Stardust Diner waiter had an amazing work attitude.

But knowing his story, I had a feeling he was actually savoring this moment.

Maybe it was regret or some form of self-compensation.

###chapter 50 Beauty

We had lunch until almost 2 PM.

Zoey was thrilled with the meal. She might look skinny, but man, she had quite an appetite! She polished off several plates of meat all by herself.

She was so stuffed she could barely move, just lying back in her chair groaning, "Mrs. Smith, Tony made you chase him for so long, treating us to a meal is the least he could do."

I chuckled to myself. When it was time to pay, the waiter came over and said the meal was already covered, and we could just leave. But I insisted on paying the bill anyway.

Zoey's eyes went wide, and she tried to stop me, "Mrs. Smith, didn't Tony say it was on the house? If I knew you were paying, I wouldn't have ordered such expensive dishes."

"He is he, and I am me. The connection between Tony and the Entertainment Club murder case is still unclear. Even if he's tight with Alan, I haven't met him, so I don't want to owe him any favors. Besides," I glanced at the not-so-expensive bill and smiled, "it's not much. Didn't we agree that I would treat you to lunch? What does it matter if someone else covers it?"

"I get it, Mrs. Smith! Until he's cleared of any connection to the case, he's still a suspect, and we can't accept his favors!" Zoey said, holding my arm and smiling.

"Yes, but not quite. The main reason is that I think he's had a tough time. Whether it's his life or his experiences, let's leave this free meal opportunity for Tammy and Anna." I said.

My gut told me Tony wasn't directly connected to the Entertainment Club murder case, but like Tammy and Lally, he was hiding something. From the beginning, I had never wanted to make things difficult for them; I just wanted the truth.

Now, with Alan's connection, when Alan lived in Sand Village, he was well taken care of by Tammy and George. I had to repay that kindness. If Tony had no essential connection to the case once the truth was revealed, and since Silverlight City Legal Journal was indeed expanding its new media business, I would be willing to help him.

Before leaving, I greeted Tony and set up a meeting at a nearby café at 6 PM.

Then I took Zoey to Stellar Plaza to buy clothes. I used to have terrible taste in clothes and didn't like shopping. During college, Cindy would drag me to look at clothes, and after marriage, it was Alan. He said that a person couldn't just work; they also needed to live. Every weekend, he would go shopping with me, seriously commenting on the clothes he picked for me, which ones were good and which ones weren't. I must say, he had a great eye.

Zoey was about 5.74 feet tall, with a very balanced figure. When she had first started her internship, she had a youthful street hip-hop style, which was cool, but in winter, especially as a reporter, it had lacked a bit of maturity. Fortunately, Zoey had liked to wear dark coats in autumn and winter, and with her tall stature, she had looked particularly good in them. But after all, she was in her twenties, and dressing like she was in her thirties wasn't quite right. She had needed an inner layer to balance it out, and a green dress would have been perfect, making her look lively and young, yet trendy.

After browsing the mall, we ended up back at the first women's clothing store.

As Zoey put it, it was like revising a plan over and over again, only to find that the first version was the best.

Today, Zoey was rocking jeans, little boots, a gray wool coat, and a short cream-colored sweater underneath. She looked put-together but a bit low on energy. She grabbed the green dress and dashed to the fitting room. After changing, she came out and struck a pose, giggling, "Mrs. Smith, how do I look? Am I a beauty or what?"

The green bohemian dress was a burst of color in the winter, and the gray wool coat balanced it out perfectly. With her slightly curly long hair, she looked both elegant and carefree.

I was momentarily taken aback, like I was seeing a scene from ten years ago when Alan took me shopping for the first time. I had just graduated and started working. Alan got his first paycheck and said he wanted to buy me clothes. That piece of clothing cost $1,000, which was almost half a month's salary for a fresh grad back then. Alan didn't even flinch.

"When I was a kid, I thought if I made money, I would definitely buy clothes for the people I love, whether it's love or family. That's the most valuable thing for me," Alan said.

Ten years had passed, and so much had changed. The person I had loved was no longer here. I had searched high and low for the truth to console our lives.

Seeing Zoey's joyful expression, I silently understood what Alan meant back then. "Yes, indeed. You look even more beautiful in this, you gorgeous lady."

"Mrs. Smith, you're a gorgeous lady too. I'm just a little beauty," Zoey said with a cheerful smile.

I walked to the counter to pay. The clothes weren't very expensive, or rather, the important thing wasn't the price. It was Zoey, whom I've known for half a year, always accompanying me. She's innocent, pure, lively, and always empathetic with me. It seems like fate anticipated my misfortune and sent her to my side in advance.

"Hello, just this one, please wrap it up."

Zoey's birthday was on December 15th, and mine was on December 30th. This was her gift, and also a gift for myself.

Around 6 PM, I arrived at the nearby café as agreed.

When I left Stardust Diner, Tony mentioned again to meet at the nearby café, clearly indicating he didn't want Zoey to come.

Maybe he wanted to tell me something private, or he simply wasn't familiar with Zoey and didn't want to interact with her. And to be honest, I came to this meeting as Alan's wife, and Zoey is indeed an outsider, so I let her go home first.

I checked the time and ordered two cups of coffee.

Soon, Tony appeared at the door, saw me, waved, and walked over to sit down.

"Mrs. Smith, didn't I say I would treat? Why did you still pay?" Tony sighed, picked up the menu to order coffee, "This time it's on me, please don't be polite."

But seeing the prices on the menu, he paused and awkwardly said, "I wanted to find a nice place for our first meeting, but it is a bit expensive."

Then he waved to the waiter, "Hello, one water and one coffee, please." He explained, "I can't sleep if I drink coffee at night."

"No need, Tony, I already ordered." I said gently, "Save the free meal at Stardust Diner for next time when you bring Anna and Ms. Martinez."

Tony was stunned for a moment, then realized, "I thought you came to our house just to ask some questions. It seems I was right; Mrs. Smith, you did investigate. Otherwise, you wouldn't have talked to Anna for so long."

"Anna is also thinking about you. So, are you interested in joining our company?" I looked at him deeply.

"Thank you, but... I'm fine where I am now, so I won't come. Let's finish our conversation today; we might not meet again in the future."

###chapter 51 The Expected Response

"Alright, no rush. Take your time to think about it. No need to be all formal. Lally mentioned that Alan grew up in Sand Village. Your family treated him very well, and you were like brothers. I'm his wife, so let's skip the pleasantries," I said.

Just then, the waiter brought over our freshly brewed coffee. I handed him a cup and said, "Let's cut the small talk and get straight to the point."

"Ask me anything, I'm an open book." Tony held the coffee cup with both hands, trying to warm up. He looked pretty cold.

"So, why are you working here? With your background, even if the new media industry is struggling, being a waiter seems like a waste of your talent," I asked.

"I guess you've already been to Digital Leap Technologies, and they probably filled you in about Anna," Tony said with a straightforward smile. "It's not a big deal. Anna was part of it, but it wasn't about pride. That job just felt meaningless to me."

He continued, "A job should either pay well or make you happy. Unfortunately, I got neither. I was writing the same stuff every day, and it drained me. I love writing, but I never wanted to gain anything from it. I wanted to give something to others through my words. Ads, scripts, headlines... I got sick of them. I stuck it out for a while for Anna, but eventually, I had to quit."

"I don't know why, but I couldn't sleep at night, like there was a weight on my chest. I wanted to be around people, where everyone was chatting. People are most relaxed when they're eating. I love seeing their smiles. When they're happy, I feel better too." With that, he forced a smile.

Thinking back to what folks at Digital Leap Technologies said about Tony having an artistic vibe, it seemed true. He reminded me a bit of Alan, probably because of his upbringing, always idealistic.

At the same time, I realized Tony wasn't as introverted, dull, or unintelligent as people said. He had a rich inner world.

"This morning, I was driving behind you. You knew that, right?"

Tony nodded.

"How did you recognize me?"

That was my first question. At noon in Stardust Diner, he walked straight over without hesitation, like he knew I'd be there.

"The first time you came to my house, I saw you at the alley entrance, but I was wearing a helmet, so you didn't notice me."

He continued, "I know everyone in the village. You're a stranger. When I passed the fruit stand, the owner called me over, saying my mom had a pretty niece visiting her. My mom is an only child, so I knew something was off. I thought it was someone from the Entertainment Club trying to mess with my mom."

"After I got home, my mom said a reporter visited today, asking about the Entertainment Club and wanting to help with the Sand Village demolition a few years ago."

Tony took a sip of coffee and said, "I still didn't figure it out then."

"Until Anna showed you my business card, saying I was going to introduce you to a job that you realized, right? Even though you hadn't met me, Alan must have mentioned my name to you," I said calmly.

"Mrs. Smith, no wonder you were a prosecutor and now the chief editor of a legal journal," Tony nodded and smiled. "When I saw the business card, I had a rough idea, but I had no strong feelings. Instead, I was happy for Toby, I mean Alan. If you were indifferent to such a big event, that would be unusual."

"That night, Anna hesitantly told me what happened that day. When she was messaging on the bed, I saw it too. I kind of figured you might be suspicious of my mom's or Lally's testimony."

"Go on with your guess," I said, not giving anything away.

At this point, I had a whole new impression of Tony. He was too perceptive, piecing together everything from just a few bits of information and accurately guessing my suspicions. I was starting to think this guy wasn't simple, maybe even a bit dangerous.

"Before I continue, I want to ask, is my guess correct?" Tony asked.

"I don't think that's important. It's not why you've been avoiding me," I replied directly. "I tried to contact you by phone or interview, but you kept dodging me, which made me suspicious of you and everyone else..."

"Ms. Martinez and Lally's testimonies have issues, but I always felt they weren't directly involved in the case. Only you, I couldn't figure out. You went to the Entertainment Club that day and had the opportunity to be there, but no witnesses mentioned you. Ms. Martinez didn't mention you either, even hiding the fact that you took her to the Entertainment Club. Your return home time didn't match up, but what were you doing during that nearly one hour? Could it be related to the case? Shouldn't I investigate you?"

Hearing my words, Tony sighed and said slowly, "Anna is too soft-hearted and can't keep things to herself. I think she was worried my mom gave false testimony and implicated me. My mom and Lally are honest people, inexperienced, and would be nervous in court, afraid of not explaining clearly. So... they dictated, I organized it, and they memorized it to say it exactly in court, ensuring no key evidence was missed."

"That's just one aspect, Tony," I stared at him coldly. "This way, no evidence would be missed. Think carefully before telling me. Don't let this case involve you. All the evidence now shows it has nothing to do with Laura. I believe you and Alan were like brothers. I believe Alan's death has nothing to do with you, but... don't let Alan down."

I had anticipated his explanation.

"There's nothing else; that's the truth," Tony slowly shook his head.

"When Lally called me a few days ago, saying she met a very enthusiastic reporter, I knew you had found Lally. Lally is a good girl, kind, gentle, and wholeheartedly good to others. Unfortunately, Duke is unreliable, got addicted to drugs, and his personality changed. This year, he even started hitting her. That night, my mom's legs were indeed not convenient, so I took her to Lally's. I was worried Duke would cause trouble, so I waited for a while. Lally told me to go back first, and I couldn't refuse her, so I left."

It was a flawless response. I kept observing his demeanor-calm, composed, and sincere. When he mentioned Lally, the anger and sadness in his eyes were evident. It seemed he knew about Lally's recent troubles.

But there was one detail. When I mentioned that all evidence showed Laura had little to do with the case, his left eye twitched slightly. 

This subconscious, subtle expression made the seemingly gentle, humble, and sincere Tony appear... sinister for a moment!

I thought of the typical second male lead in novels Lally mentioned, "In these kinds of novels... comparatively, the male second lead's fate is always tragic. Betrayed by lovers, abandoned by friends, left alone, with a bad ending-either turning evil or committing suicide."

I had a vague guess in my mind.

###chapter 52 The Past of Sand Village

"Tony, you really need to think this through. We haven't met before, and honestly, we don't have much of a relationship. But I can't ignore the bond between you and Alan. I'm just trying to help you out here."

Tony thanked me but didn't seem moved.

"Let me ask you again, I promised to help you with the Sand Village demolition case, so why didn't you reach out to me?"

Tony replied, "It's been a long time, I didn't have much hope, and... you can't blame Zack for this. Don't listen to what Anna told you. When I got into trouble, I didn't even know her."

Tony gave a bitter smile, but from that point on, I didn't want to believe a single word.

"So you're saying, after you got into trouble, Zack stopped coming home, and you two basically lost contact?" I followed his line of thought.

"My mom only has two kids. Even though we're not biological brothers, we naturally have feelings for each other," Tony said with a bitter smile. "How could real brothers not stay in touch? We call each other during holidays, but other than that, there's nothing. Otherwise, Anna would make a fuss."

It was another lie. The breakfast stall owner clearly said that George and Tammy later adopted another child.

What was he hiding? But here, I didn't plan to expose him.

I took out the copies of Zack and Tony's insurance policies from my bag and pushed them in front of him without saying a word.

In his previous words, he seemed to be talking about how good the relationship between the two brothers was, but in reality, he was trying to push Zack away and draw all the attention to himself.

From Tony's perspective, if the Sand Village demolition brawl case and the Entertainment Club case were linked together, then Zack seemed to be the most important person hidden from my attention.

"I'm not lying to you... Mrs. Smith."

Tony took out his phone and showed a photo of a hospital test report, lymphoma, and test date of April 2020. It had been four years until now.

He had cancer?

"After the incident in 2019, I didn't answer any of Zack's calls. If I said I wasn't angry or resentful, that would be a lie. He didn't dare to come into the village; the villagers wouldn't let him off. Even though he got me a large compensation, as a man, no amount of money can compensate for the most basic dignity. But... when I went to the hospital for a check-up, I found out about this, late-stage cancer; even going abroad wouldn't give me much hope."

Tony put away his phone and picked up the insurance policy copies, looking at them and said, "That night, I didn't sleep at all. Early in the morning, I called Zack and said we shouldn't treat it; living in pain is worse than living a few more years. My mom only has two sons; the older one can't come home, and the younger one is useless, so let's buy insurance for our mom. When I'm gone, she can use the money to live without hardship. Toby knows about this too."

This was the first time tonight he mentioned Alan on his own.

"What did he say? Do you guys stay in touch?" I asked lightly. Alan never mentioned them to me.

"Mrs. Smith, don't be angry. Toby probably never told you about his childhood, don't blame him." Tony sighed deeply and continued, "After Toby got married, we rarely contacted him. Even before you got married, Toby came to Sand Village and invited us to the wedding. We didn't go. He had a new life, and the past days were better left unremembered. So, we chose not to disturb him."

"His four close friends from college came," I mentioned casually.

Tony was stunned for a moment and responded, "Toby mentioned them. Zack is familiar with them since they came from the same orphanage. I don't know them."

When I mentioned Laura earlier, his expression wasn't as calm as it is now.

"Yeah, there's an age gap between you two," I said, trying to keep the conversation going. "Tell me about Alan. He wanted to stay in Sand Village after graduation, but I stopped him. Now that I think about it, I might've ruined your reunion."

Talking about Alan, Tony's eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but smile. "Mrs. Smith, you did the right thing. Sand Village is dirty and poor. Why would he want to live there? When he first started working after graduation, he called and said he couldn't find a place to stay. I told him to stay upstairs at my place. The next morning, he rushed down and said he had to move out. I asked why, and Toby, a bit embarrassed, said you told him to move out, or you'd come to Sand Village to deal with him."

Tony chuckled. "Haha, Toby is usually gentle and quiet. It was the first time I saw him act so efficiently. In less than half an hour, he packed everything and ran out the door with big bags. My mom told him to have breakfast before leaving, but he said no. It was the first time I saw him so scared. I wondered what kind of fierce girlfriend he had, and it turned out I didn't meet you until ten years later."

I couldn't help but smile too. Tony's vivid description made it seem like Alan's awkwardness happened just yesterday.

I apologized slightly, "Sorry, if I had known he had such good friends in Sand Village, I wouldn't have rushed him over. But that noon, when he was sweating and running downstairs at my place, it was indeed funny."

Tony's eyes were full of smiles, and he waved his hand repeatedly. "Mrs. Smith, no need for polite words. A top university graduate living in Sand Village-does that make any sense? If he didn't leave, I would have had to charge him rent!"

Talking about Alan, Tony couldn't stop. "Toby is really a good person. In my heart, he's like my real brother. You know, it's not easy for a teenager to live in Sand Village. The village thugs bullied him because he had no parents. Later, my dad found out and let Toby move next door to us, and he finally settled down."

"Toby is eight years older than me. My most vivid memory from childhood is him studying late at night in the hot summer and cold winter. He was afraid of the cold, wrapped in a blanket studying. When he saw me, he would hold me and teach me to read. He was actually my first teacher. He lived on school scholarships without money, but still took me to the store to buy snacks. The rest of the money was spent on books. He read to me, and I learned from him... Unfortunately, I'm not as smart as Toby."

"Like a father, like a brother," I said lightly. 

Tony was immersed in his memories and didn't notice the subtle change in my expression. "Yes, like a father, like a brother. It feels like he's still with us, doesn't it?"

"Yes." I sighed, not wanting to listen to his memories any longer. "Your answer is perfect. I believe you wrote Ms. Martinez and Lally's testimonies. But with such deep feelings, when your closest loved one dies, there's no trace of sadness on your face."

"If it's heartless, then you and Lally wouldn't talk so much about him. But if there's another hidden truth?" I gently turned the coffee cup in my hand and said lightly, "Tony, my patience is limited. Tell me. Do you know anything about the orphanage and Tom? This is the last time I'm helping you. Don't make me investigate. If I find out anything, and discover you are involved in the case, I won't hesitate for a second."

Tony was silent for a moment, then said sadly, "Mrs. Smith, I've come to terms with life and death. I'm very sorry about Toby's death, but I'll soon join him, won't I?"

What about Lally and Tammy? Such a powerless explanation!

"Do you still have contact with Lally?" I suddenly asked.

Tony looked up sharply, seemingly realizing something, and slowly shook his head.

"Lally is missing."

Tony's face changed dramatically!

###chapter 53 Unraveling the Mystery (1)

Until it was very late and I was about to leave, Tony adamantly insisted that he didn't know Tom.

He also mentioned that the orphanage was gone and didn't want to talk about the past anymore.

I didn't push it, knowing I wouldn't get anything out of him. From his expression, it seemed like he didn't know about Lally's disappearance either. When I brought it up, he got all uneasy and anxious.

Why would he be so concerned about the living but show no emotion for the dead?

Plus, while chatting with Tony, I suddenly remembered something from over ten years ago. When Alan had just graduated and moved to Sand Village, I called him, and he came over right away.

But according to Tony, Alan was super nervous back then, like he was worried I'd find out about his connection to Sand Village, like he was hiding something.

Was it a painful memory? If it was, why would he go back? And this place wasn't an orphanage.

There was only one possibility. Ten years ago, he and the folks from Sand Village were up to something together, hiding it from me, scared I'd find out.

Also, there was another important detail. When Tony talked about his relationship with Zack, he was really protective of him.

Tony showed me his diagnosis notice, which looked legit. He really had a terminal illness, and considering that, he had a reason to buy a big insurance policy for Tammy with a hefty payout.

But Tony only paid $500,000 for the policy, while Zack paid $1,500,000. Could Zack be sick too?

That explanation didn't really add up.

Zack, Tom... I had a hunch that Tony definitely knew Tom, and the relationship between Zack and Tom must be close!

While driving, I kept thinking about it. Could Tom be from the orphanage too, or did he live in Sand Village? It seemed too coincidental. Plus, during the trial, Tom's clothes and the car he drove didn't match someone from a slum or an orphanage.

Silverlight City had already started providing heating. When I got home, the whole house was warm, and I even felt a bit hot.

At that moment, my dad sent a message: [Is the heating on?]

I'd been busy with the case lately, and with Alan not home, I didn't have time to pay the heating bill. Luckily, my dad remembered and paid for it.

Nancy: [Yes, it's warm!]

My dad replied: [Nancy, are you busy this weekend? Want to come home and see this lonely old man?]

I felt a pang of sadness. After thinking about it, I decided to keep it from my dad for now.

Nancy: [Don't worry, Dad, I'll definitely come. But Alan is on a business trip this week, attending a state exchange meeting, and probably won't be back until next week.]

My dad replied: [I knew my son-in-law was promising. He's already attending a state exchange meeting. Back in our days, only the top performers could go!]

Nancy: [Alright, you go to sleep. Your son-in-law is definitely excellent. Do I have a bad eye for people?]

After saying this, my eyes welled up again.

These days, Alan's past has gradually come to light, but everyone connected to him seems to be hiding something from me, even Alan, who started hiding things ten years ago.

Could there be a connection between Zack, Tony, and Tom?

I suddenly remembered that I had taken a picture of Tony's motorcycle license plate while tailing him in the morning. I quickly pulled out my photo album: [SilverlightD·K6329]

Motorcycle license plates often have lucky numbers or the owner's birthday, and the letters usually match the owner's initials.

The letter "K" didn't fit Tony at all.

I hopped on Facebook and found Ruben's profile picture.

Nancy: [Ruben, you there?]

A few seconds later, Ruben replied: [Yes, Mrs. Smith! Always ready to help. Need to catch someone?]

I glanced at the clock; it was already past 11 PM. I sent him the photo of Tony's motorcycle license plate.

Nancy: [Sorry to bother you so late. Two things, no rush, you can reply tomorrow.]

Ruben: [Mrs. Smith, you can speak! I'll get it done efficiently!]

Nancy: [First, help me find out who owns this motorcycle license plate; second, check if there was an orphanage within 7 miles of Sand Village twenty years ago. Also, keep looking for Lally; she shouldn't be with Tony.]

Ruben: [Got it, Mrs. Smith! No problem! By the way, is Ms. Taylor with you?]

Typical Benjamin's apprentice, always up to something and thinking differently. It was past 11 PM; why would Zoey be with me?

Nancy: [No, Zoey is probably already resting at this hour.]

Ruben: [Right, Mrs. Smith, can I have Zoey's contact info?]

It was exactly the same. When Benjamin wanted Cindy's contact info, he also sent me a text message. Could it be that this was taught by Benjamin as well?

Helping me with business while trying to set up Ruben and Zoey. This guy was getting smarter.

I thought for a moment and sent a screenshot to Zoey.

Soon, Zoey replied with a shocked emoji: [This guy is still up to no good, and that Mr. Wright, pretending to help you while secretly matchmaking for his apprentice. Mrs. Smith, just curious, did you set up Mr. Wright when he was pursuing your roommate?]

I chuckled. Zoey was smart; she probably guessed it was Benjamin's idea.

Nancy: [Yes, you guessed it.] 

I replied, adding a smiley emoji.

Zoey: [Sure, send him my Facebook card. They are helping us, so we should give them some reward.]

Zoey sent another message: [I never do good deeds, only deal with those with delusions. I've had many guys pursue me; some even set up flowers and candles under the university building, singing. I went down and stomped them out one by one. That guy covered his face and ran away, never to appear in front of me again!]

I replied: [Benjamin did the same thing.]

Zoey replied: [A match made in heaven, master and apprentice, hahaha, I'm dying of laughter.]

At that moment, Ruben called, "Hello, Mrs. Smith? I asked a friend in the traffic police department to check the motorcycle license plate. The owner is Zack Garcia, registered in 2010. As for the orphanage near Sand Village, I'll have to check tomorrow. Orphanages are managed by the social services department, and I have a classmate there, but they are off work now. Unlike police, who are on high alert 24/7."

Was it Zack's motorcycle? But thinking about it carefully, it made sense that Tony was riding Zack's motorcycle.

Looks like the license plate didn't give us much.

I said, "Thank you, please follow up on the orphanage matter tomorrow."

Ruben responded, "No problem, Mrs. Smith, I'll definitely give you an answer tomorrow!"

Then I said, "Thanks. By the way, you wanted Zoey's contact info, right? I just asked her, and she's okay with it. I'll send it to you now."

The guy on the other end of the phone was almost jumping with joy, pleasantly surprised.

Good luck, young man. Everyone's success was unique, including your mentor.

###chapter 54 Unraveling the Mystery (2)

After getting everything sorted, I started to rethink the whole situation.

First off, I realized that the relationship between Lally, Tammy, and Tony was pretty clear. And as for another witness, Tom, I figured he had to be connected with Tony and the others.

No doubt about it. If Tammy and Lally's testimonies were bogus, then Tom's final statement in court totally covered up the gaps in their stories.

Even though the three of them had different takes, their goal seemed to be to go after Laura. When I brought up Laura, Tony's reaction was a dead giveaway.

And what about Tom? What kind of beef would a guy like him have with Laura that he'd need to team up with these folks from Sand Village?

From a social class angle, there shouldn't be any link. Then it hit me: could Zack and Tom know each other? Did they strike some kind of deal, with Tom giving false testimony? Also, I remember Tom saying in court that he was waiting for a client at the Entertainment Club. Could that client be Zack?

My boss, Howard, had mentioned before that Tom's business was tied to urban planning and construction, which just so happened to match the Sand Village demolition case.

Thinking about this, I checked the time. It was almost midnight. Knowing Howard, he was definitely still up. Sure enough, he picked up after a few rings.

"What's up, Nancy?" Howard asked.

"Are you busy? I need to ask you something. Which company does Tom work for?" I asked.

"He's got a few companies. If you need specifics, I'll have to check." Howard replied.

"Just the main one, the urban planning and construction one," I said.

"I know that one. It's called 'Dream of Sand Urban Planning and Investment Construction Co., Ltd.'" Howard said.

I jotted down the name on my phone and thought this needed to be fast-tracked. I couldn't wait until next week to see Tom.

"Howard, can we set up a meeting with Tom this week? I have a hunch there's something fishy going on. This guy must be linked to Lally and Tammy from Sand Village." I said.

"Let me think. It should be doable. I'll ask tomorrow and get back to you." Howard said.

"OK, also, do you know someone named Zack?" I continued.

"Which Zack?" Howard asked.

"The one who organized the demolition team during the Sand Village case in 2019, the one who caused the fight. He should be Tony's brother." I replied.

Howard thought for a moment and then said, "Oh, him. I know of him but haven't met him. Wait, I remember now. The final compensation process for the Sand Village demolition case was handled by Tom. So, a lot of the news reports can be accessed firsthand. I'll set up a meeting with Tom tomorrow under the pretext of thanking him for his work on the case, and you can join us as well."

"Great! Thanks, Mr. Martin." I said.

"Don't mention it! Let me know if you need anything." Howard said.

Sure enough! There was a connection between Tom and Zack, and Tom also had ties to Sand Village.

I opened an app on my phone that specializes in company info and searched for "Dream of Sand Urban Planning and Investment Construction Co., Ltd." Tom's name was listed among the shareholders.

I clicked on Tom's profile and found out he was involved in over a dozen companies. This guy had his hands in everything-design and construction, dining, fast-moving consumer goods, electronics, and even some overseas ventures.

I checked each one but didn't find any names linked to Zack.

I exited and searched for Zack. There were tons of results, so I filtered for those related to real estate but still came up empty.

The Sand Village demolition case was a big deal, involving both the government and real estate developers. A project that size couldn't be run by a small-time player. 

Zack, who could throw down $1.5 million in insurance, had to be in upper management, and his name should be somewhere in the company records.

How could he just vanish, existing only in the stories from the folks in Sand Village?

Something was definitely off.

I searched for Tom again and checked all the companies where he was listed as a legal rep, executive, or investor.

After a long and exhausting search, it was already 3 AM.

Finally, I found Tom listed as a shareholder in a multinational company. He had a small stake but held the CFO position.

The company was called "C.K Internet," headquartered abroad, with its main office in Silverlight City.

As I kept digging, I found the name of the company's general manager and CEO, a name I should have thought of but had overlooked-Frank.

Tom actually knew Frank!

Then I remembered Frank's expression when I first met him.

When he heard about Alan's death, he was devastated. But if they were truly close friends, hearing about the other's death wouldn't result in such a calm expression, especially for a witness in this case.

Tony, Lally, and Tammy seemed to hate Laura deeply. What about Frank?

I remembered Frank's reaction when he heard about Laura. His attitude towards her was no different from the others, but Frank explained that he had a relationship with Laura during college.

Could this be the source of their hatred for Laura?

No, Frank, Laura, Mike, and Bob all came from the orphanage. Why didn't Frank mention this when we talked? Frank specifically said he became close to Alan in college.

But they had known each other since childhood!

Frank was hiding something! He didn't tell the whole truth!

And all of this was centered around the orphanage.

Something must have happened ten or even twenty years ago, something significant involving Laura, leading these people down different paths.

Because of this event, they began to hate Laura, and Alan must have played a role in it. Due to some accident, he met with misfortune, and these people directed all their anger and hatred towards Laura, determined to see her dead!

At the same time, this was a huge conspiracy involving Sand Village, the orphanage, and even Silverlight City and state-level leaders, causing the police, prosecutors, and court personnel investigating the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case to be transferred.

Thinking of this, my heart started racing, and my limbs went cold. This timeline spans over twenty years; the cases and people involved were all connected.

Returning to the present, the most important thing now was to investigate Tom, understand his connection with Frank, and find the vanished Zack.

I had a vague feeling that Tony lied. He must be familiar with Frank, Mike, Bob, Laura, and the others. And their relationship was not shallow!

###chapter 55 The Disappeared Orphanage

Perhaps because my thoughts were becoming clearer and I was getting closer to the truth, that night, I didn't dream about Alan. Instead, I had another weird dream. I was surrounded by thick fog and found myself among a group of kids.

These kids looked so pitiful, dressed in rags, skinny from hunger, and shivering in the cold winter wind.

They stared at me with tearful eyes, their lips trembling like they had a lot to say.

"What happened?" I asked, squatting down and touching a little boy's head.

The little boy just shook his head, not saying a word.

"Where are your parents?" I asked again.

The kids lowered their heads and started crying, their sobs getting louder. I panicked, not knowing how to handle kids, and tried to comfort them. "Don't be scared, I'm here."

A gust of wind blew, clearing the thick fog and revealing that I was in the ruins left by a massive fire.

It wasn't fog earlier, but thick smoke from the fire.

The kids seemed to hear something calling them and soon ran off, leaving me anxious. How could these kids run around like that? It was so dangerous out there.

I stumbled along a path, calling out to the kids, but no one answered.

At the end of the path, I saw a boy holding a girl's hand, arguing about something. In the end, the girl left the boy, leaving him alone, crying.

Was it Lally and Duke? Something suddenly clicked in my mind.

The boy had his back to me, squatting at the intersection, sobbing softly, his shoulders shaking. Such a small child, why was he crying so sadly?

"Alan?" I said.

Tears rolled down my cheeks. Why was I crying again? This name seemed to have some kind of magic. If I heard it during the day, it would always mix with the information from these days; if I said it in my dreams, tears would fall like rain. All my tears were shed dry in my dreams.

"Alan, if it's you, just look back at me. Alan, I don't blame you for hiding it from me. Tell me, what happened back then? Why did you leave so suddenly?" I said.

He heard my voice and stopped crying. Just as he was about to turn around, the phone rang.

I woke up groggily on the couch, reaching for my phone on the table. It was a call from Howard.

"Hello? Howard," I said.

"Hey, Nancy, were you sleeping?" Howard asked.

I groggily and grumpily responded, "Yes."

"Yeah, you've been tired lately. Get some rest," Howard continued.

I realized something was off and looked at the time. It was already eleven in the morning. Last night, when I found out about Frank and Tom's connection, it was already past 3 AM.

Right, Howard was planning to meet Tom today!

I struggled to get up from the couch and gathered my thoughts. "Did you get in touch with Tom?"

"That guy didn't answer my call, so I called his secretary directly. I know his schedule for today. We're going to intercept him on the way!" Howard said.

"Howard, isn't that a bit too much?" I hesitated.

From what Howard had said before, his relationship with Tom wasn't that close. They had only worked together on a project before, and a couple of years ago, during the Sand Village demolition and brawl incident, Howard had gotten some information from Tom for the Silverlight City Legal Journal. Other than that, they had no contact.

If we intercepted him on the way, wouldn't that be too aggressive?

"What's wrong with that? Besides, I'm bringing the editor-in-chief of Silverlight City's biggest legal weekly to personally invite him to dinner and thank him. Don't worry about Tom's attitude. Get ready, and we'll meet at the company entrance at 1," Howard said.

Howard was trying to reassure me. Tom was his business partner, and I was just a partner in the company, essentially an employee. Howard was risking offending a business partner to help me, which really touched me.

"Howard, thank you..." I said.

"Don't thank me, Nancy. Remember, in just three years, Silverlight City Legal Journal has achieved what it has today because of you, not me. I couldn't have done it without you. You've done your part, now it's my turn. Oh, and don't go upstairs when you get to the company. I'll wait for you at the entrance," Howard said.

Then Howard hung up the phone.

I was momentarily stunned by his sudden praise. Then I quickly tidied up the bedding, took a shower to wake up, changed clothes, grabbed a bite to eat downstairs, and drove to the company.

Today, I didn't want to ask about any clues regarding the Entertainment Club murder case. I was sure Tom's testimony was false and that he was closely connected to Tony and Frank.

I had just received a Facebook message from Ruben. Lally was still missing, and his friend had checked all the orphanages in Silverlight City over the past few decades. Strangely, there was no record of any orphanage near Sand Village.

According to Lally, the orphanage should be no more than 7 miles from Sand Village, but Ruben said they had expanded the search to 14 miles and still found no orphanage.

Silverlight City had only one orphanage or similar institution, located in the eastern suburbs, the Silverlight City Orphanage, while Sand Village was in the west, completely opposite directions.

The orphanage they had mentioned seemed to have disappeared from history, as if it had never existed.

Lally was missing, Tony didn't want to mention the orphanage, and Frank, even more so, had lied to me, saying he knew Alan from college. He wanted to hide this matter too.

That left Tom. He must know something, either from Zack or Frank, otherwise, he wouldn't have come forward to give false testimony.

When I arrived at the company entrance, Howard, dressed in a suit, was already waving at me from a distance. He ran over to help me park my car and get into his.

"Why are you dressed so formally today?" I asked.

Howard usually wore casual clothes, rarely dressing so formally.

"Meeting Tom, I have to dress formally." Howard chuckled, touching his nose. "That guy is more than ten years younger than me, but his ability is undeniable. It's better to be formal."

"True," I nodded. After all, we were visiting someone. "By the way, why didn't you want me to go upstairs?"

"What do you think?" Howard glared at me. "There are only two people in this company I'm afraid of, you and your precious apprentice Zoey. If you go upstairs, she'll definitely follow you in the afternoon. I heard this case has issues at the state level, involving a lot. Is that true?"

###chapter 56 The Sunshine of Dreamscape Sea

I nodded. Leonard had mentioned this a few days ago when he came to the hospital.

"So she needs to stay out of this case, or her dad will have my head," Howard snorted.

I heard from Zoey that Howard and her dad were college buddies. Zoey's dad worked in law enforcement and had helped Howard a lot when he was starting Silverlight City Legal Journal.

"Zoey never mentioned my connection with her dad?" Howard looked at me, a bit surprised.

"She mentioned it briefly. I didn't pry since it's her family business," I replied.

"It's no big deal. Ronald Carter and I were roommates at law school in Silverpeak City. After graduation, I became a lawyer and later started my own business. Ronald, on the other hand, joined the police department. He's quite capable and lucky. Every boss he had appreciated him, and he climbed up to become the deputy captain of the criminal investigation team at the state police department. Pretty impressive," Howard said.

"Zoey doesn't share her father's last name?" It was the first time I knew Zoey's dad's last name was Carter.

"Yeah, Zoey took her mom's last name. Her mom is Erica Taylor. They divorced early on. Ronald was so busy he couldn't take care of the family. Erica wasn't the type to tolerate that, so they split. Honestly, both of them had their issues. They were both career-driven and neither wanted to compromise. They didn't even have time to pick up Zoey from school when she was little," Howard snorted angrily.

"So, they had you pick her up?" I asked.

Even though Howard was a businessman, this showed he valued relationships and friends deeply. Because of this, he made many friends in the business world.

"Exactly. I was just a small-time lawyer back then, with plenty of free time. They asked me to pick her up. Both of them were workaholics, one always on business trips, the other always working overtime. Eventually, Zoey stayed at my place after school and spent her vacations with Erica. When she started middle school, they realized I was an outsider and had Zoey live at school. Can you believe such parents exist?" Howard complained, but there was a smile on his face. 

It was clear he considered Zoey as his daughter. I remembered he was in his fifties and had never married.

"When Zoey graduated from college, I called Ronald and Erica to ask about her plans. Erica wanted Zoey to work at her company, and Ronald wanted her to join the legal system. I told them to forget it. Zoey never mentioned any of this. She said she wanted to work out of town," Howard continued.

"And Howard, you didn't want Zoey to go out of town alone, so you had her come to your company?" I smiled. Zoey had mentioned that Howard called her dad to arrange it.

"That's right. I watched Zoey grow up. How could I let her go out of town alone? Anyway, Silverlight City has me, and I'll protect her. I called Ronald and said, 'Since she doesn't want to go to either of you, she might as well come to me. I've already found a mentor for her.'" Howard glanced at me and raised his eyebrows. 

He continued, "Of course, I also considered their father-daughter relationship. I had Ronald call Zoey and say it was his idea, not to mention me. How about that? Thoughtful, right?"

Zoey only mentioned that Howard and her dad were college classmates. She never told me about her relationship with Howard, which was almost like father and daughter. She probably didn't want me to know about it, fearing I might have other thoughts.

"Zoey knows. She said you suggested she come to the company. Don't worry, she remembers." I patted Howard's shoulder.

"She... Since we're talking about this, let me tell you my thoughts," Howard said.

Howard was driving, and after a moment of contemplation, he smiled. "It's nothing much. Silverlight City Legal Journal was my first entrepreneurial project. Before you came, it didn't have much success. Over the years, I had other businesses and didn't pay much attention to it. After you came, Silverlight City Legal Journal gradually improved. You know the achievements of the past few years."

"Just hear me out; no need to say no right away," Howard said, like he already knew what I was going to say. He paused, then continued slowly, "After we sort out Alan's case, I'm stepping back from the company. I'll leave it to you and Zoey. I'll keep 40% of the shares, you get 30%, and Zoey gets 30%. You'll be the one mainly in charge. And don't tell Zoey about the shares. She's still young and inexperienced. When she gets married in a few years, it'll be my gift to her. What do you think?"

"I refuse," I said.

I didn't even think about it and just declined. Even though this newspaper wasn't huge, it was still valuable, especially with Howard's plan to collaborate with foreign newspapers starting this year. The 30% shares were invaluable. I'd only been here for a few years, and this was too much for me to accept.

Plus, I had my own plans. After Alan's case was resolved, I would find a good time to tell my dad everything. We'd leave this city together. 

My dad had mentioned wanting to retire in the South. Alan and I opposed it because it would be inconvenient for him to be alone in another place. Now that Alan was gone, I would accompany him.

This would take a year or two. During this time, I would train Zoey to be a key player. I was confident in this and wouldn't let Howard down.

"Leaving a place doesn't mean saying goodbye to the past or letting go. On the contrary, you might get more entangled. Think about it carefully. Life is long," Howard said.

He seemed to have anticipated my response and didn't say anything more. The car fell into a brief silence.

"Do you know why I've been helping you so much since Alan's accident? It's not just because of your ability, your contributions, your character, and so on... There's something more important," Howard suddenly brought up this question after a while.

"What?" I asked.

I had thought about this question, but all the reasons I came up with were already mentioned by Howard.

"Because I can relate..." He sighed deeply. "Everyone in the company says I'm unmarried. Actually, I was married, two years before Erica and Ronald. She was my college classmate, from a very well-off family. After graduation, her family opposed our relationship. But she insisted on being with me, saying life would get better, even if we were poor... What a silly woman."

"When I was a small-time lawyer, I had no clients and was often idle. She earned much more than I did. To be honest, during that time, she almost supported me. Oh, she really liked Zoey and thought about having a son in the future and making Zoey our daughter-in-law," Howard continued.

The car slowed down. Howard smiled, his dry eyes filled with light. "As a man, I couldn't let a woman support me. When I couldn't make it as a lawyer, I decided to change careers. By chance, I founded Silverlight City Legal Journal. Later, the business gradually expanded, and life got better."

"One day, she said she wanted to travel abroad and bring back the sunshine from Dreamscape Sea, coffee beans from Astoria, and pebbles from Blue Moon Creek... The plane never reached its destination. When I saw the news, my world collapsed."

Howard rubbed his eyes and smiled bitterly. "As a man, I cried day and night. It was too hard. No matter how much money I made, it was useless. All these years, I haven't remarried. I won't meet another woman like her. But I have to live, or how could I face her? If I told her I couldn't live without her, she'd scold me."

"I dreamed of her a few days ago. When I woke up, I suddenly remembered a poem. How did it go? Doing business and dealing with money all the time, I forgot these things... Oh, right..."

"Ten years, two lives, in the vastness of life and death,

How many partings and meetings have we experienced?

The hair has turned white, the face is no longer the same,

But the heart still holds the same feelings."

###chapter 57 A Foreign Insurance Company

After Howard finished talking, he just clammed up and kept his eyes on the road.

Céline Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" was playing on the speakers.

Classic tune, classic story-Jack Dawson saved Rose DeWitt Bukater with his life. In her old age, as she neared the end, she looked back on those days.

Even though Jack saved Rose, from the moment he sank into the ocean, Rose was trapped in her own cage, unable to let go or forget for the rest of her life.

Just like Howard. After his wife passed, he was stuck in his own prison. A guy could be fragile, could cry, could be broke, but he couldn't lose his fighting spirit. During that time, Howard was just a shell, drifting through each day in a fog.

In the end, the longing for his late wife and his own willpower helped him break free, or maybe, the cage was never really locked.

I never would've guessed that Howard, always so carefree and full of life, had such a past.

During this time, hadn't I been in my own cage too? I couldn't find joy, couldn't really feel sorrow. I never felt hungry, just living on autopilot, investigating cases non-stop.

People said that money could solve 99% of the problems. Perhaps those who believed so were fortunate, for the remaining 1% had the power to render the other 99% meaningless.

Like the caprices of fate and the chasm between life and death, insecurity was woven into our genes. People attempted to evade it through reading, learning, thinking, and managing money, but what was destined to come ultimately arrived. Obsession, effort, and fate-they were distinct and not necessarily intertwined.

"All things are like a dream, a bubble, a dewdrop, a flash of lightning. That's how you should think of them." 

Alan used to read religious texts along with poetry and literature. He often recited this, and every time he did, he'd ponder it for a long time. 

I didn't get it, but as I thought about it, I found myself saying it out loud.

Howard looked at me, surprised. "Didn't expect that. I thought you only read criminal and civil law. How come you're into religious texts too?"

I was a bit lost at first, not getting what Howard meant. After a moment, I said sadly, "Alan used to say this a lot. It just came to mind, and I recited it without thinking."

"Yeah, that's more or less the gist of it, though it might sound a bit ruthless." Howard paused, then said slowly, "But those who call it ruthless are usually the lucky ones. How fortunate... So, how do you understand it?"

I shook my head, not really knowing the true meaning. But thinking of Alan, the complexity of this case, and the fates of Tony, Lally, and Duke, I suddenly felt a bit clearer and said, "If everyone accepts fate and sees its true nature, then all actions are pointless."

"Law enforcers believe in law and justice, convinced that the truth will come out, the guilty will be punished, and the victims will find peace. As for fate, enlightenment, or nihilism, I might be confused by them, but I'll never stop moving forward," I continued.

"That's the spirit!" Howard said, giving me a thumbs up.

"Keep your eyes on the road, man. Why aren't we there yet? Are you sure about Tom's schedule today?" I asked, feeling more determined than ever.

We'd been driving for almost an hour since leaving the office, and it seemed like we were still far from our destination.

"Yeah, I'm sure. I asked him today, and he said he was busy with some business at a suburban insurance company," Howard replied.

"An insurance company?" I echoed.

"Yep, it's a foreign insurance company. There's only one in Sand Village. This guy's business is booming, even dealing with foreign insurance companies," Howard said with a hint of admiration.

I couldn't help but think about the huge insurance policy Zack and Tony took out for Tammy, which was also with a foreign insurance company. 

Howard had mentioned before that Zack didn't handle the compensation for the demolition and fighting case in Sand Village; it was Tom who took care of it.

And now, just as I started investigating Zack after looking into Tony, Tammy, and Lally, Tom happened to be at this insurance company. Could there be a connection?

"Are you sure about Tom's perjury?" Howard asked.

"Tammy and Lally both gave false testimony. Now Tony and Zack can't clear their names either. If nothing unexpected happens, Tom not only committed perjury but also colluded with others and might even be directly involved in this case," I explained.

I briefly shared my suspicions about Tom and the orphanage but left out Alan. It was his secret, a painful memory he didn't want to bring up, and I didn't want others to know either.

"So, Lally, Tammy, Tony, Zack, and Tom all orchestrated that trial. Alan's death might really have nothing to do with Laura, but they insisted on putting Laura to death?" Howard was surprised that these seemingly unrelated people were all involved in the case.

"Yes, although I don't know why, all signs point to these people conspiring together," I confirmed.

Howard's lips curled into a smile, and the car's speed increased a bit. This rare smile, with pursed lips but slightly upturned corners, usually appeared when an investment succeeded or money was made. It was somewhat restrained but couldn't hide his inner pride.

"Do you know anything else?" I asked.

"No," Howard replied.

"Then why are you smiling?" I said.

"Think about it. Tom colluded, committed perjury, and tried to frame Laura. If he gets caught, he won't be out for several years, right?" Howard's smile grew even wider.

I was stunned for a moment, then nodded, still not fully grasping what he meant.

Howard glared at me and said discontentedly, "When he goes to prison, won't the market share be up for grabs? Then... don't blame me for being unkind. Achieving success too early isn't always a good thing for young people. Look at him, thinking he's invincible just because he has money and status, daring to challenge the authority of the law. When I visit him in prison, I'll have to give him a good lesson on the law. After all, I was a lawyer..." 

"Nancy, why are you looking at me like that? I'm your boss!"

###chapter 58 Clumsy Disguise

The car was parked right in front of the insurance company.

It was my first time here. The insurance company was a standalone building with "K.Berkshire" hanging above it. It looked pretty impressive. I remembered the name from the policy and was sure it was the same company.

Howard jumped out of the car faster than usual, looking unusually eager. I got out with a look of disdain. Business people were never as simple as they seemed. Howard's warm-hearted and loyal reputation was just a facade.

As soon as we walked in, the security guard at the front desk stopped us. "Hello, sir. Do you have an appointment?"

Howard glanced at me, not wanting to look awkward in front of his subordinate. He patted his expensive suit, which he rarely wore, and cleared his throat, "Howard Martin."

"Hello, Mr. Martin. Do you have an appointment?" The guard was super professional, with a polite smile on his face. I almost laughed out loud, silently watching Howard squirm.

Howard looked embarrassed, glared at the security guard, and pointed to himself, "I, Howard Martin, haven't you heard of me? Founder of the Silverlight City Legal Journal." Then he pointed to me, "This is Nancy Johnson, editor-in-chief and senior partner of the Silverlight City Legal Journal. Do we need an appointment to come here?"

Did I agree to this senior partner position? This guy just gave me a title...

"Hello, Ms. Johnson. I'm sorry, I haven't received any news about an interview from the Silverlight City Legal Journal. How about this, you can sit on the lobby sofa and wait for a moment. I'll call my superior, and if there's any news, I'll let you in immediately." The security guard was very polite, bowed slightly, and took out his phone to make a call.

"Do you believe that if we write a news article tomorrow, your company won't be able to continue? Do you even know whose territory this is? You are so arrogant..." Howard said.

Seeing that he was about to embarrass himself, Howard rolled up his sleeves, ready to argue. I quickly pulled him back and smiled at the security guard, "Sorry, we're here to find someone. Is Mr. Tom Harris here?"

"Tom Harris?" The security guard frowned, "Sorry, we don't seem to have a client named Tom Harris here."

"Howard!" Just then, a man came out of the VIP room in the lobby and greeted us.

It was Tom.

It had been a while since I last saw him in court. He still looked the same, with medium-short hair slicked back with thick hair gel, gold-rimmed glasses that made him look refined, and a well-fitted gray suit that looked expensive.

After exchanging a few words with the manager from the VIP room, he quickly walked towards us. Seeing that he knew us, the security guard didn't stop us anymore, apologized, and left.

"Tom! Making big money again, huh?" Howard patted Tom's shoulder boldly.

"Come on, Howard, you're kidding me. I'm here to discuss some business. I just finished and saw you. Are you here for business too? Let's sit on the lobby sofa and catch up. It's been a while, and I can learn a thing or two about business from you, Mr. Martin." Tom said.

Then the three of us sat on the lobby sofa, and the waiter brought three cups of coffee.

"I'm getting old and want to customize an insurance policy." Howard touched his nose and smiled perfunctorily, with a hint of smugness in his tone.

"And this is..." Tom's expression changed slightly when he saw me, and he asked with a smile.

"Let me introduce you formally, the former prosecutor of Silverlight City, the top contributor to the Silverlight City Legal Journal, my right-hand assistant, our company's reporter and editor-in-chief, Nancy Johnson!" Howard said.

I didn't pay attention to Howard's exaggerated commercial flattery. I nodded slightly to Tom and smiled, "Hello, Mr. Harris."

From that look in his eyes, I knew he recognized me from the courtroom, even though I was wearing sunglasses that day.

But I was curious. The victim's family sat on the left side of the courtroom, and the witnesses sat on the other side. He shouldn't have seen me.

Could it be that Tony or Zack tipped him off? If so, then Howard's repeated attempts to meet him might be because he already knew I was here.

"Hello, Ms. Johnson. Nice to meet you." Tom stood up, ready to shake my hand, with a very good attitude.

I stood up and shook his hand, smiling, "Really, Mr. Harris? I remember this should be our second meeting."

At this point, all the pleasantries were pointless. I needed to confirm his connection to the case and his relationship with Zack and Tony. So, I went straight to the point, no pretense.

When he saw me, he was already flustered. I didn't know why, but I was sure he was in turmoil inside.

Howard was also stunned by my words, then pretended to be confused and laughed, "You two really have a connection."

"Do we?" Tom frowned, thought seriously for a moment, and apologized, "I'm really sorry, Ms. Johnson. Please forgive me, I truly forgot."

"Silverlight City Court, True Love Entertainment Club murder case. Mr. Harris, you were a witness at the trial. Have you forgotten so quickly?" I said calmly, watching Tom's expression closely.

Tom responded, suddenly realizing, and repeatedly apologized with a smile, "I remember now. When I left the courtroom, I saw you talking to a young reporter from the Silverlight City Legal Journal. Since this newspaper was founded by Howard, I thought about saying hello, but seeing you talking to the reporter and having other matters to attend to, I left. Ms. Johnson, you are indeed a legal professional, with an amazing memory. I admire you."

I recalled that day. I did say a few words to Zoey. At that time, Tom and I had brief eye contact from a distance, but this reason seemed too far-fetched.

"Yes, that was my apprentice, Zoey." I didn't intend to say any more pleasantries and went straight to the point, "After listening to the trial that day, I found many doubts in the case. Since we've run into each other today, can we talk in detail about what you saw that day?"

Tom took off his glasses and rubbed his temples, looking very tired. He occasionally glanced at Howard, indicating that he didn't want to answer this question. 

Howard, at this moment, was engrossed in a cooking show on his phone, nodding occasionally, deeply engrossed.

"This matter has been over for a while. The memories of that day are not pleasant. If it's not a mandatory cooperation, can we talk another day? I have some matters to attend to." Tom stood up to leave.

"How about this, Mr. Harris. I remember you said you were waiting for a client that day. May I ask the client's name?" I stood up and stopped Tom.

"Business secret, no comment." Tom's face turned livid.

"Is it Alan Smith?" I said calmly. Tom's mind was already in chaos. Mentioning Alan's name would surely expose his facade.

"Ms. Johnson, as a journalist with experience in the prosecutor's office, please always be mindful of your identity. Do not falsely accuse others. This is not good for the reputation of the Silverlight City Legal Journal." Tom adjusted his glasses and sneered. 

Although he was speaking to me, he was looking at Howard. The meaning was clear. This was a threat and a warning.

Howard seemed not to hear, picked up his phone, and made a call, "Hello? Zoey, it's Howard. How about dinner tonight..."

Seriously, Howard? You could at least fake it better-your phone was still playing the short video!

I was speechless but also very touched. Howard was helping me this time, not knowing about Tom's doing initially. Moreover, he didn't care about Tom's warning, clearly taking a risk.

"What if I'm not acting as a legal professional?" I said calmly, looking coldly at Tom.

"What do you mean?" Tom asked.

"Today, I'm asking you as a family member of the victim," I replied.

###chapter 59 One Person, Two Identities

Tom let out a heavy sigh, glanced around, and looked a bit lost.

He grabbed the coffee on the table, downed it in one gulp, steadied himself, and said in a serious tone, "It's done. The suspect's been caught, and we've got witnesses and evidence. Justice is served, and that should be enough to give the victim some peace."

Tom went on, "I know you, but I don't want to think about that night. There was a power outage, and I have claustrophobia. My mental state was all over the place. Why would I want to remember that? As a witness, I've done my duty. My conscience is clear, so Ms. Johnson, stop bothering me! This ends here. I hope you... stop digging!"

After that, he patted Howard on the shoulder and sneered, "Howard, you should really get that insurance today. Maybe bankruptcy insurance. If you need help, call me. I can recommend a few options."

Howard didn't respond, "Tom, are you leaving? Aren't you staying for a meal? Don't be so distant."

Tom snorted and walked out without looking back.

Howard watched him go and chuckled, "Young folks are so impatient. He got mad so fast. Looks like this case really hits close to home for him."

I was going to comfort Howard, who was ready to back me up, but seeing his smug look, it seemed pointless. Howard was right; Tom's reaction today was definitely off.

"Looks like Tony and Zack already filled him in," Howard said, stroking his chin thoughtfully.

"You need a deerstalker hat and a pipe now," I joked, feeling in a lighter mood.

"Yeah, Mrs. Smith, and maybe an Ulster coat too. The company won't cover it," Howard said smugly, clearly realizing he was on the right track.

"Enough joking, you're half right," I said.

From talking to the security guard to seeing Tom greet us, I had a hunch. If I was right, the mystery of Tony, Zack, and Tom's relationship over the past few days could be solved.

"Half?" Howard asked.

"Yeah, only Tony told Tom, but Zack didn't. Now I just need to confirm one thing," I said.

With that, I headed straight to the VIP room Tom had just left, with Howard right behind me, "What do you mean?"

I knocked on the door, and the manager who had just spoken with Tom was sitting at the desk drinking coffee. Seeing me, he immediately stood up and smiled, "Hello, may I help you?"

"Hi, we're colleagues of the guy who just left. You saw us picking him up at the door. I'm his secretary, and we just realized he lost his phone. We came to see if it might be here," I improvised.

"Colleagues of Mr. Garcia? Please wait a moment, I'll check." The manager hurriedly went to search the sofa.

My heart raced. It seemed my guess was right; Tom was Zack! Tom and Zack were the same person!

High-end insurance companies here were all membership-based, and the security guard at the door must recognize the members. When I told the guard I was looking for Tom, he said there was no such person here. Then Tom showed up. So from that moment, I had a strong suspicion.

Howard's eyes widened, looking at me in disbelief.

"Yes, please check carefully. It's Zack Garcia. He was pretty anxious, saying the phone had the insurance policy details with Tony. He came here to handle some business, right?" I asked, trying to see if Tony had been in touch with him recently.

"Yes, he came to discuss the insurance coverage. A Mr. Thomas also wants to insure. Please wait, it might not be on the sofa..." The manager carefully checked the sofa cushions, answering my questions seriously.

"Is the Mr. Thomas you mentioned Frank Thomas? Mr. Garcia specifically asked me to call Mr. Thomas to follow up on this matter. How did the discussion go? I didn't see Mr. Thomas today. Do you need help pushing this forward?" I said.

"Thank you so much. Mr. Garcia was supposed to come with Mr. Thomas, but Mr. Thomas had something come up last minute. They just confirmed the insurance amount." The manager thanked me repeatedly and apologized, "I've checked everywhere. Maybe you should ask Mr. Garcia again. It's not here."

After thanking him, I quickly pulled Howard out of the insurance company.

I got it now. After all this running around, Tom was Zack. Zack, Tammy, Tony, and Lally had all conspired to give false testimony in court.

What exactly happened that made this group harbor such hatred towards Laura? Could it be related to the demolition case?

It shouldn't be to the extent of hating her so much that they wished she were dead. Besides, Frank was also involved in this matter.

This meant that Tony's mention of Lally, himself, and Duke being young and only familiar with Alan was a lie. They must have significant connections with Frank and others I haven't met yet, like Bob and Mike.

At the same time, Lally didn't fully tell me about the past, cleverly hiding Frank and the others. But I believed she didn't do it intentionally; she probably didn't know at the time.

Wait! A few days ago, I asked Tony how he recognized me, and Tony said he knew my name!

That meant Lally must have known my name from the beginning!

I suddenly broke out in a cold sweat. This meant Tony must have informed Lally in advance, but coincidentally, Lally was assaulted by Duke that day, and I saved her.

If she didn't know I was Alan's wife, why would Lally seriously tell me her past story?

If she didn't know I was Alan's wife, why would Lally tell me about Alan's past, about Alan being in an orphanage?

Wait! She could have completely hidden Alan's story, just like Tony did, keeping it tightly under wraps. Why did she tell me about Alan being in an orphanage?

From the current investigation, only Lally seemed to be intentionally or unintentionally telling me about Alan's background. And after Lally spoke, Tony also revealed some information.

This girl, along with Tony, was deliberately guiding me to uncover the truth behind this matter. But at the same time, they had significant reasons for not wanting to reveal more.

Especially, why did Lally disappear suddenly after telling me about the orphanage, and when I told Tony about her disappearance, Tony seemed completely unaware?

Now, the previously overlooked Frank reappeared in my mind. This case was not just about the grudges in Sand Village. The root cause lied with Frank. He must know about the orphanage, and he might be the real mastermind behind this whole affair!

###chapter 60 One Person, Two Identities

"Nancy?" Howard gave my sleeve a little tug, snapping me out of my daze. I realized I was drenched in sweat.

"Why'd you suddenly stop talking and zone out? Have you been overworking? Maybe you should see a doctor," Howard said.

I shook my head, my thoughts finally clear. I didn't know the whole truth, but Lally must've told me this stuff on purpose, and Tony did too.

In Tammy's investigation, the testimony seemed fishy, and I never saw Tony. Most of what I knew came from Lally, and then Tony showed up, knowing I was tracking him.

My suspicion of Tony started from my first visit to Tammy's house. I knew Tony was there on the day of the incident, and then I found a copy of an insurance policy slipped into the Sand Village demolition fight case file. That copy made me even more suspicious of Tony.

Tammy, Lally, Tony, and Zack seemed to be in cahoots, all tied to Sand Village, but there was one exception: Frank.

After getting in the car, I sat in the back seat while Howard drove me home.

On the way, Howard marveled, "I can't believe Tom is actually Zack. Back then, he had two identities for the Sand Village compensation scheme. Who knows how much money he embezzled? No wonder the accounts didn't match up."

"The accounts didn't match up?" I asked.

"Yeah, there was a discrepancy of nearly $500,000," Howard sighed. "Tom's really bad, making dirty money."

"Why didn't they match up?" I already had an idea and said calmly, "Do you know why he came here today to handle business?"

Howard looked puzzled and shook his head, not getting my point.

"Remember when I asked if anyone had been in our archives?" I asked.

"Yeah, why?" Howard replied.

"When Zoey and I were going through the Sand Village fight case materials, we found a copy of an insurance policy. It was a joint policy taken out by Tony and Zack, also known as Tom, for Tammy. If Tony died accidentally, his mother Tammy would get a big insurance payout. Tony insured himself for $500,000, which was actually his compensation. I was curious because Tony's injury, while emotionally significant, wouldn't warrant such a high payout. Now it makes sense. Tom went even further, insuring for $1.5 million," I explained.

As I spoke, I laid out the whole story to Howard, including Zack being from an orphanage and his relationship with Lally.

"Tom... well, he loves his mom. If he's not involved in this, I should still help him," Howard said.

I was about to say he was loyal to his family, but seeing Howard's eyes darting around and muttering numbers, I changed my mind.

Suddenly, Howard gasped and chuckled, "Tom invested about a third of his assets. He's really a good son. As an adopted son, he's no different from a biological one."

"Nancy, I may not have a lot of money, but I'm not poor. Do you think Zoey will treat me the same way in the future?" Howard asked out of the blue.

I rolled my eyes at Howard. He wasn't poor at all. Just from the Silverlight City Legal Journal, he made millions annually. In recent years, with his investments, his wealth probably surpassed Tom's.

Thinking about Zoey and Howard's relationship, I nodded, "She will. Zoey's a lucky girl."

"Lucky? Her parents, one only knows how to make money, and the other is a workaholic. They neglect their daughter and look down on each other. They're both the same!" Howard said, clearly upset on Zoey's behalf.

"Very lucky," I said, looking at Howard. "Zoey has two fathers."

Howard was stunned, his mouth opening and closing without saying anything. But the smile on his face didn't fade, and his eyes reddened, tears almost falling before he blinked them away.

This might be one of men's talents. It wasn't that men didn't cry; they merely concealed their emotions so well that even they couldn't find them.

"I like hearing that. I'll give you a raise, shares, and make you a partner!" Howard laughed heartily, unexpectedly in a good mood.

I smiled, "Did you hear the manager say someone else was going to insure?"

Howard, seeing I didn't respond, didn't press further. He nodded, his eyes shifting slightly, "Frank?"

Frank was more familiar to him. It seemed he didn't expect a business friend to be so deeply involved in this case.

"What has Frank been up to lately?" I asked.

"Not sure. Frank's health isn't good, and he rarely socializes. I don't usually call him out." Howard shook his head slowly, "I'll give him a call."

He opened the car phone, found Frank's name, and dialed, putting it on speaker. Soon, the call connected.

Howard said, "Frank, where are you? Let me guess, counting your heartbeats at home again? What's there to be afraid of? Come fishing with me. The sun is shining, the sky is clear, and even the winter fish are coming up to sunbathe. You and I... did I say something wrong?"

Howard was like this, never giving the other person a chance to say "hello," always talking. Even teasing Frank, who was seriously ill, about counting heartbeats at home.

"Is this Mr. Martin? Hello, I'm Mr. Thomas's secretary." The voice came from the other end.

"Why didn't you say so earlier! Wasting my feelings. Where's Frank? Is he so important now that his secretary answers his calls?" Howard continued to grumble.

"Mr. Martin, I'm sorry. Mr. Thomas is asleep," Frank's secretary apologized.

"Asleep?" Howard and I checked the time, 4:00 PM, and his tone turned sour, "What's he doing sleeping now? Sleeping during the day, writing poetry at night, and calling me to talk about poetry and drama. Damn, how am I supposed to understand that?"

"It's 8:00 AM here. Mr. Thomas is at the Edria headquarters." Frank's secretary replied.

"What? When did he go back?" Howard asked.

"He arrived in Edria the night before last. There's something at the headquarters. I'll let him know when he wakes up. Don't worry." Frank's secretary said.

Howard hung up the phone. Frank went abroad? Howard and I exchanged a look, and he turned the car around, stepping on the gas.

"Where to?" I asked.

"Frank's company! If he's not there, we'll go to his house and break the door down!" Howard said angrily.

I understood. Frank and Howard were close. Howard was helping me and also helping his friend. But why was Frank involved in this case? Now, not only I but even Howard wanted to get to the bottom of it.

###chapter 61 Who is this idiot?

Howard and I scoured everywhere, from Frank's company to his villa out in the 'burbs.

But we didn't find a single trace of him. Everyone at the company was singing the same tune: Frank had skipped town.

Did someone tip him off?

Now, all our key leads were dead ends. Without Frank, we were in the dark about the orphanage, the folks from Sand Village, and all the drama with Laura.

It was pushing 7 PM when we finally left Frank's villa. Howard suggested we grab some dinner and thought about inviting Zoey too.

I noticed it was getting late. Today, I heard Howard spill about his past and his thing with Zoey. Plus, I hadn't seen her at the office today, so I was down.

It was rush hour, and Howard was busy driving, so he asked me to call Zoey. She should've just clocked out.

I figured I'd video call Zoey on Facebook. After a couple of rings, Zoey's pretty face popped up on my screen, frowning and grumbling, "Mrs. Smith, were you and our boss sneaking around investigating a case today without me?"

Howard overheard and got all worked up about how Zoey addressed him. He snorted and pretended to be mad, "Is that how you talk about me in front of your mentor? Our boss? From now on, call me Howard!"

Zoey got flustered and probably guessed Howard had spilled the beans about their relationship. She stuck out her tongue and made a funny face, cheekily saying, "I'm your employee at the office, not at home. Calling you Howard would seem rude and might make people think we're too close."

"Who was it that claimed to have connections a few days ago?" I glanced at Howard and teased Zoey with a smile. 

I didn't blame Zoey for not telling me about her relationship with Howard. To me, she was just an intern at first. She learned fast and had talent. Over time, she became not just my apprentice but also like a sister. That was enough. Who her parents were or her relationship with Howard didn't matter.

In fact, knowing about her and Howard made me happy for them.

Zoey raised her eyebrows, crossed her arms, and proudly said, "I learned from Ms. Johnson, and I rely on my skills to make a living. I never ask for favors. Whoever says I have connections, I'll scold them!"

Seeing the background behind her, which looked like the door to my office, I asked, "Aren't you worried your colleagues will hear you in the office?"

Zoey giggled, "Of course, there's no one here. Everyone's gone. I'm the only one in the office. What do you need?"

At this moment, Howard raised his voice, afraid Zoey wouldn't hear, "Why are you still in the office? Since when did our company have such a model worker? Hurry downstairs, my car is almost there. Let's go eat!"

Though it sounded like teasing, Howard was actually concerned about Zoey, thinking she was still working overtime. But knowing Zoey, she was super efficient and always left on time. If she hadn't left yet, it must be for another reason.

Sure enough, Zoey blinked mysteriously and said, "Well, coming downstairs would be troublesome. You'll know when you get here."

About twenty minutes later, we pulled up at the bottom of the company building. And who did we see? Ruben, Benjamin's apprentice, standing there.

He was surrounded by a crowd, with candles arranged in a heart shape at his feet, a Bluetooth speaker playing some romantic tunes, holding a bouquet of roses in one hand, and talking on the phone with the other. It was quite the spectacle.

But the guy forgot to change out of his police uniform again!

Ruben was saying, "Mr. Wright, don't worry. I've got everything set up just like you asked. Zoey isn't avoiding me. She said she's working overtime. I'm sure Zoey likes me! Just wait and see!"

Howard stood in front of the car, frowning, his mouth twitching, and pointed at Ruben, "Who is this idiot? Do you know him?"

He wasn't worried Zoey would fall for Ruben; he just thought the whole thing was a bit too tacky.

Only I knew about Ruben and Benjamin's quirky ideas. It was likely because Ruben had asked me for Zoey's Facebook last time, and Zoey, being her lively self, chatted with him, leading Ruben to misunderstand. So, Benjamin, who was on a business trip, gave Ruben some advice.

I was speechless. After all these years, Benjamin hadn't changed a bit. Ruben and Benjamin's inexplicable confidence was truly baffling!

Looking up at the office window on the tenth floor, Zoey poked her head out and waved at me. She had a mischievous smile, clearly not scared but enjoying the show.

I dialed Benjamin's number, and he answered, "Hey, Nancy, do you need any help? I'm busy right now."

This was obviously a guilty conscience, pretending not to know. Wasn't he just on the phone coaching Ruben?

I didn't waste any words and got straight to the point, "Ruben is already famous at the bottom of my company building. Get him out of here!"

"Nancy, you see, it's mutual between the kids. Let's not interfere, okay?" Benjamin hurriedly spoke up for Ruben.

"I don't care about Zoey and Ruben, but Ruben is flaunting his police uniform, surrounded by people taking pictures. If this gets online, the image of the police being serious and disciplined might be compromised," I said.

"Damn, this idiot!" Benjamin quickly hung up, and soon Ruben received a call.

I don't know what Benjamin said, but Ruben let out a scream, quickly took off his police uniform, and called a few people from the crowd to help pack up and leave.

It seemed like a "group operation." This jerk had pulled in police officers to help him chase a girl. If Benjamin found out, it wouldn't be the first time he got a good scolding.

"Ruben!" I called out, and the startled Ruben turned around. 

Seeing me, he instinctively shrank his neck, knowing he couldn't leave now, and walked over with his head down. Howard looked at Ruben with a grim expression, half-smiling.

"Mrs. Smith, what a coincidence?" Ruben grinned awkwardly.

Was there really such a resemblance between master and apprentice? I was speechless but didn't intend to chat. I asked, "How's the investigation on Lally going? Oh, and Duke."

I suddenly remembered that Duke also lived in Sand Village and had close ties with these people. He must also know something about the orphanage.

###chapter 62 This guy is interesting

As soon as Ruben heard it was work-related, he straightened up and said, "We're still looking into Lally's whereabouts. We've got our colleagues in nearby cities, high-speed rail stations, bus stations, toll stations, airports, and all that jazz helping out. The moment they spot her, they'll let us know. We won't nab her right away; we'll tail her and see what's up." 

He paused and continued, "We're also considering she might be hiding out with someone. We've been checking out the Entertainment Club, her neighbors, and anyone she might've been in contact with, peeling back the layers bit by bit. Mrs. Smith, don't worry, we'll find Lally."

Ruben was thorough and on top of things. Benjamin's apprentice was doing a solid job. Then I asked, "What about Duke?"

Ruben replied, "Mrs. Smith, Duke's in mandatory rehab right now. His mental state is pretty shaky, not much different from when we found him at the Entertainment Club. If you want to talk to him, now's not the best time. He's too unstable, and his statements might mess up the case."

"Alright, thanks, Ruben." I nodded. It seemed like questioning Duke was off the table for now.

"Well... Mrs. Smith, if there's nothing else, I'll head out?" Ruben asked, a bit hesitant.

Before I could respond, Howard laughed and clapped Ruben on the shoulder, "Mr. Adams, don't rush off. Stay for a meal."

Ruben shook his head but then asked cautiously, "Are you... Zoey's dad?"

I almost laughed out of frustration. Seriously, he still had the nerve to ask if Howard was Zoey's dad? If he was, would Ruben really want to have dinner with him tonight?

"No," Howard said, standing tall. It seemed my comment about Zoey having two dads had cleared up some of his inner conflicts. He added happily, "But..."

"Then forget it, I have other things to do. Mrs. Smith, call me if you need anything, I'll be there anytime." Ruben looked disappointed, said his goodbyes, and left, leaving Howard standing there awkwardly, his expression shifting.

Suddenly, Howard chuckled, "This guy's something else."

"Don't overthink it, Zoey doesn't like him at all." I waved my hand, trying to cool down Howard's fatherly enthusiasm.

Howard glared at me and said, "What are you thinking? Marriage has to be a match in social status. This guy's just a regular cop. Not to mention, Zoey's dad is the deputy captain of the state criminal investigation team. That's a huge difference."

I looked at him with disdain, thinking, 'Weren't you just a struggling lawyer back then? Didn't your wife fall for you anyway?'

Howard added, "What I meant by interesting is that this guy's got a good head for work, but..."

"But what?" I asked.

"But in other areas, he's a fool," Howard replied.

I burst out laughing. This was exactly how Benjamin's mentor had described him back in the day.

At dinner, Zoey couldn't stop laughing as she recounted today's events.

Ever since Ruben added her as a friend, he'd been checking in three times a day, showing a lot of concern, just like Benjamin did when he was chasing Cindy. According to Zoey, it was almost identical-movies, dinners, park visits...

Unfortunately, Cindy and Zoey were like night and day. Cindy was the slow-to-realize type, not great at understanding her own feelings. Even though she fell for Benjamin at first sight at the train station, I figured it was because she already had a soft spot for him deep down. But Cindy had never been in a relationship, so she didn't really know what love felt like.

Zoey, on the other hand, was a whole different story. Despite lacking parental love growing up, she came from a wealthy family and was drop-dead gorgeous. Word on the street was that Zoey had been getting love letters from boys since elementary school, and in college, the line of guys chasing her could stretch from the cafeteria to the dorms. But she wasn't into any of them. Plus, Zoey was lively and had read tons of romance novels, so she was pretty much immune to all that lovey-dovey stuff.

Zoey told me that Ruben messaged her at noon, saying he'd come to her office in the afternoon to watch a movie with her. She was busy cranking out a draft and missed the Facebook message. By the time she finished, it was quitting time. Just as she was about to reply, Ruben was already downstairs at her office, ready to make a grand gesture.

Since Ruben had been busting his butt helping with Alan's case, she couldn't just blow him off. She was about to call me from upstairs when I sent her a Facebook video call first.

Now that I knew about her relationship with Howard, Zoey was super relaxed during dinner. She was polite, greeted both me and Howard, and even the waitstaff. She knew our tastes so well, she ordered without even looking at the menu.

Dinner was a blast. Zoey played the perfect host, sharing funny stories from her company, serving Howard food, and acting like the perfect daughter. Seeing that, Howard was over the moon. 

When Howard and I talked about the case, Zoey stayed quiet, acting like she wasn't interested.

But knowing Zoey, that was a bit off.

After dinner, Zoey snuck off to pay the bill, making Howard even happier. He kept saying Zoey hadn't been spoiled in vain and that she was even treating him to a meal now.

As expected, when it was time to leave, Zoey held my arm and said with a smile, "Mr. Martin, you go ahead. Mrs. Smith and I will take a walk and then grab a cab back."

Howard was in such a good mood that he forgot all about Frank's matter and waved us off, saying the cab fare would be reimbursed by the company tomorrow, and drove home.

"Can you tell me now?" I looked at my apprentice. She had been so well-behaved today and hadn't complained about not being taken along, so she must have had an ulterior motive.

"I overheard your phone call with Mr. Martin today!" Zoey hugged my arm tightly, resting her head on my shoulder like a little girl. "This case is not simple. Even the higher-ups are on edge. Mr. Martin must be worried about me. But... I'm your apprentice. Your business is my business. If I asked too many questions during dinner, Mr. Martin might not let me participate in the future."

I was touched and patted Zoey's head, saying gently, "Howard treats you very well."

"Of course. When I was little, he even tricked me into calling him dad, saying it wouldn't hurt to have one more dad." Zoey wrinkled her nose. "But I refused."

I sighed inwardly. Zoey probably had more expectations and love for her biological father. Even though he was busy and she didn't take his last name, Carter, his importance in her heart was not diminished.

I heard Howard mention today that Zoey's father's name was Ronald Carter. It sounded familiar, but I couldn't place where I had heard it before.

###chapter 63 The Language of Heather Flowers (1)

"Zack and Tom are actually the same guy. Crazy, right? But it means we can combine the two groups we were looking into, Sand Village and the one with Frank and Laura, into one investigation."

Zoey bit her lip, thinking back to what I said over dinner, and tried to piece it all together.

"Okay, let me get this straight. Whether Frank left Silverlight City on purpose or not, the big question now is why Sand Village and Frank are after Laura. It all goes back to the orphanage."

"But when it comes to the orphanage, we've been trying to dig up clues through interviews, probably out of habit. Now Frank's on the run, Tony's clammed up, Zack or Tom, whichever, isn't talking, Lally's missing, and Duke's in no shape to help us out."

Zoey blinked, the streetlights reflecting in her eyes, and she smirked a bit, "But... something you said got me thinking."

"What did I say?" I asked, a bit surprised. Zoey might seem laid-back, but she's sharp. She'd been listening and putting things together during dinner. I was proud of how far she'd come from the girl who used to tag along with me, acting on impulse. She was focused and rational now.

Zoey said, "Let's make a guess. If Frank started all this stuff at the orphanage, and they had some secret plan involving Laura, making everyone swear to keep quiet about the past, especially since Alan was from the orphanage too, then it makes sense why they wouldn't talk about it."

Given what we knew, Zoey's theory made sense.

Alan seemed to have stumbled into this plan. They didn't hurt Alan, and when I first met Frank, his grief over Alan's death and his anger at Laura were obvious. Plus, from what Lally and Tony said about Alan, they were really close.

I nodded, our thoughts in sync, "Lally probably recognized me when we met at the Entertainment Club. Then she told me about Alan on purpose. She and Tony must've decided to give me some info to lead me to Frank."

But I still wondered why Lally, Tony, Tom, and the others didn't seem sad about Alan's death, while Frank was devastated.

"Exactly. Since Lally was willing to tell you about Alan, let's make another guess. If Lally disappeared on purpose that day, I doubt she went home," Zoey continued.

That made sense. If I were Lally and realized the person who saved me was Alan's wife, I wouldn't go home if I wanted to keep the secret. It'd be too easy for someone to find me.

And then it hit me, how did Lally manage to pack up all her stuff so quickly, except for the bedroom?

All of this was part of her plan. She wanted to reach out to me, spill some info, and then get out of Silverlight City, but Duke found her first.

I asked, "So, you think there's more evidence or something at Lally's place?"

Yeah, I left in a rush that day. Finding out Alan was from the orphanage hit me hard. I couldn't handle the fact that Alan had such a rough past, and I knew nothing about it. The pain, guilt, disbelief, and memories of our ten-year marriage just crushed me. I walked out of Lally's neighborhood and passed out.

"Yep, Mrs. Smith, am I smart or what? You left so quickly that day, Lally must've had more to tell you. I bet it's in her house!" Zoey snapped her fingers and laughed. "But... the key to Lally's house... did you get in touch with Ruben?"

I realized Lally's house would be locked up. Breaking in would alert the neighbors, and it was already late. But since Zoey brought it up, she must've had a plan. I figured Zoey had been in touch with Ruben lately. When the cops checked out Lally's place, they must've gotten the key from the landlord, so Ruben had it.

Zoey pulled a shiny key out of her bag with a grin.

I knew it. Ruben wouldn't just show up at the office after chatting on Facebook. Zoey must've sweet-talked him. Ruben, with his crush on her, would've handed over the key if he thought she wanted to investigate.

This meant Zoey had been piecing things together from the clues I shared, maybe even figuring out before I did that Lally had intentionally spilled the beans.

I asked, "Did you promise Ruben something?"

I realized that even though Ruben liked Lally, the key was still police property. As a regular officer, he didn't have that much pull. Even if Benjamin wasn't around, there were other bosses in charge.

"No way! What are you thinking, Mrs. Smith!" Zoey giggled and grabbed my arm, "I just had dinner with him once and said I wanted to help you check out Lally's place. He was too scared to give me the key."

"So?" I asked.

"So, I made a copy of the key." Zoey raised her eyebrows, looking all proud, "Impressive, right?"

I pulled out my phone, opened the ride-hailing app, and smiled, "Then, my impressive apprentice, will you come with me?"

Zoey replied, "OK!"

Lally's place was about 6.2 miles from the restaurant. It was past 9 PM, and the rush hour was over, so the roads were pretty clear. In less than 20 minutes, the car stopped near Lally's neighborhood.

It was an old, small neighborhood with just three or four rows of small buildings, no elevators, and really outdated facilities.

But for Lally and Duke, moving out of Sand Village and into this neighborhood was a big step up.

Last time I came in the morning, but now it was almost 10 PM. Most of the residents were retired elderly folks, and all the lights in the neighborhood were off. Several streetlights were broken. Zoey and I carefully made our way to the bottom of the building.

###chapter 64 The Language of Heather Flowers (2)

"Mrs. Smith." Zoey shrank her neck and clung to my hand, "Don't be scared."

I couldn't help but chuckle; Zoey was the one who was terrified, her grip on my hand was almost painful. I whispered, "Zoey, it's okay. I'm right here with you."

Zoey mumbled something about the property management not fixing the place as she peeked at the small building.

The stairs were a mess, with pitted and eroded cement. One side of the handrail was just a fixed iron plate, the wooden cover long gone. It was so narrow that two people couldn't walk side by side.

We turned on the flashlight function on our phones and walked single file, soon reaching the door of room 402 on the fourth floor.

The door was tightly locked with a seal on it. The lock looked untouched, meaning no one had been there since the last investigation.

Zoey carefully removed the seal, took out a key, inserted it, and turned it. The door creaked open.

Inside, the light switch for the living room was on the shoe cabinet to the left of the door. Zoey flipped it on, and the room lit up.

After closing the door, Zoey let out a long breath, patting her chest, still shaken, "Oh my God, Mrs. Smith, you have no idea how dark it was outside. It scared me. If you weren't with me, I would've definitely cried."

While comforting Zoey, I looked around. The packed boxes were still in the corner of the living room, and the house was clean and tidy, with no signs of a struggle. I felt relieved; at least Lally's disappearance didn't seem to involve a fight at home.

The flower on the dining table was still blooming, even after days without water. It remained vibrant, its purple hue looking even more mysterious and eerie under the living room light.

I hadn't seen this type of flower before, but Lally said it was common, usually found by the roadside or in the countryside, needing little care, just some sunlight and water to thrive.

It seemed like this flower might have been Lally's way of encouraging herself, living a simple life like grass, unafraid of ups and downs.

"Heather? Did Lally grow this? It looks like it was carefully cultivated, quite impressive." Zoey, after circling the living room, came over and exclaimed in surprise.

I asked, "You recognize this flower?"

"Yeah, I read about it in some books on plants and culture." Zoey nodded, gently touching the flower spike, "This flower loves light and is cold-resistant. It originally grew in the wild but was later used as roadside dust absorbers and garden decorations. It looks like Lally took a branch and grew it in a small pot. Generally, people grow flowers for good luck, like prosperity. The flower language of this one..."

Zoey's expression changed, looking at me, she continued solemnly, "Loneliness, betrayal, and another interpretation is revenge born from loneliness and betrayal!"

"Laura!" Zoey and I thought for a moment and spoke in unison!

We quickly headed to Lally's bedroom, turning on the light. Photos of Lally and Duke were neatly stacked on the bedside table.

The "Emily Dickinson Poetry Collection" that Alan gave to Lally was on the nightstand, with a tattered cover, yellowed pages, and the orphanage group photo that made me faint.

Zoey picked it up, looking sad, and placed the photo inside the book, handing it to me, "Mrs. Smith, this is the book Alan gave to Lally, right? Since she's missing, you should keep it for now."

I sighed, slipping the book into my bag. Now wasn't the time to get all emotional; we needed to find any clues Lally might have left behind.

We tore through every corner of the bedroom, but all we found were some old items.

Could we have been wrong? Did Lally not recognize me, and it was just a coincidence that the bedroom was messy, asking me to help clean and share old stories?

No way, Lally definitely knew my name, and Tony must have told her. Otherwise, she wouldn't have shared so much information.

As Zoey and I were scratching our heads, I suddenly noticed that the floor color under the nightstand seemed off.

Lally's floor was made of these really old square white tiles, yellowed and cracked over time. They were clean, but the flaws were obvious. The tile under the nightstand, though, looked newer.

I moved the nightstand aside, revealing a new square tile.

My heart raced as I knelt down and tapped the tile. Anyone with renovation experience knew that if a tile was properly laid, tapping it should produce no sound or a dull sound, indicating a tight bond with the cement. A hollow sound meant there wasn't enough cement underneath, requiring re-laying.

I tapped twice... it was hollow!

The tile was loose, with gray cement around the edges looking freshly applied. I took out a nail clipper from my bag, using the file to pry the tile up.

Underneath was an envelope and a stack of photos wrapped in paper.

The envelope read: [Nancy, I am Lally.]

"Mrs. Smith, we were right," Zoey said, her voice filled with excitement.

I nodded, feeling a weight in my chest. It was hdden so deeply that even the police missed it. This might be the key to uncovering the secret. Suddenly, I hesitated to open the letter.

After a moment, I pulled it out: [Nancy, when you open this letter, you must have returned to this bedroom. Yes, when I woke up and saw your badge, I guessed who you were. It's truly a divine arrangement that you found me. I want to tell you so many things, but Duke is still at the police station. If I reveal everything, Duke, Tony, and Zack will be in danger. Don't look for Tom anymore; you've already met him. He is Zack.]

My hands trembled. If I had realized Lally was guiding me, I wouldn't have left so hastily that day.

[I originally thought that with the dead and the imprisoned, the matter would be settled. The revenge was complete. But they won't let Duke go, even making Tony meet that woman... They want to destroy us, making everyone involved in this disappear from the world.]

[Nancy, I'm so scared, but meeting you, your justice and passion inspired me. I saw light, justice, and a ray of hope shining on us from outside the prison. These photos are part of the evidence of the crimes. I kept them but didn't dare to look at them, fearing Duke's anger. I hid them under the nightstand floor.] 

[After writing this letter, I don't know if I can continue living. I hope you will decide what to do. If you want to keep investigating, I will silently support you. If not, leave Silverlight City and never return, and...]

The letter ended abruptly.

Lally might have received a call while writing, hurriedly hiding the letter under the floor, but she never returned.

"Mrs. Smith... look at these photos!" Zoey, looking at the photos, was trembling, her eyes red and tears streaming down, but her gaze was filled with anger!

Seeing the first photo, I felt like I was electrocuted, my whole body shuddering!

###chapter 65 A Deep Blood Feud

There were six photos in total, the first three were black and white, and they looked pretty old.

The first one.

A bunch of kids, naked, eyes shut tight, lying all over the place. Someone in the corner had their head turned, face blurry, but they were wearing a thick coat, which meant... these kids were already dead.

I was taken aback. I thought of the story Lally told before; now it seemed she left out some parts.

The second one.

A group of kids in brand new clothes, sitting in rows on chairs, smiling, holding signs with prices on them.

The third one.

A big yard, surrounded by high walls, all the windows had iron bars, like they were trying to keep the kids from escaping. Behind the house, there was an old, abandoned building, the photo was blurry, hard to make out.

I got it now, no wonder there was no sign of an orphanage near Sand Village, not even within a 12.4-mile radius. Lally was sugarcoating the past when she told the story, this wasn't an orphanage at all! This was a hellhole for child trafficking!

I had seen stuff like this on the news before. These kids were either kidnapped from villages or snatched off the streets.

I looked back at the first photo carefully. Even though it was blurry, I could still see bloodstains and knife wounds on the bodies, and a shiny surgical tray on the table in the lower left corner.

Not just child trafficking, but organ trafficking too!

But when I turned to the remaining three photos, I was in shock, almost fell, and sat on the bed.

These three photos were in color, Lally was naked, being abused by different men, with various tools, leaving marks on her body, covered in scars and bodily fluids. Her eyes were so desperate, hollow, lying on the bed, on the sofa, like a dead person.

Lally, in the three photos, looked very young, at most fifteen years old, which meant that around the time she and Duke left the child trafficking camp, Lally was suffering inhuman torture and abuse.

If Lally was like this, then what about Duke, Zack, Frank, Bob, Mike, Laura, and Alan? What exactly did she mean by betrayal, what did Laura do to them? And, revenge, who did "they" refer to?

"Mrs. Smith, let's go," Zoey said with trembling eyes, these photos really scared her.

I hugged Zoey, comforted her for a while, waited for her to calm down, put the floor and bedside table back in place, and put the photos and letter in the bag.

I held Zoey's hand tightly and went out of the community. She didn't say a word the whole way, and when we were far away from the community, she suddenly hugged me and cried loudly.

Each photo was a bloody crime. She had seen Lally at the Entertainment Club, thinking that was a misfortune, until she saw the place in the photos, the piles of corpses, child organ trafficking, or being priced as commodities, or Lally being abused.

Alan also came out of this place. How much suffering and hardship he endured, coming out of hell, still retaining kindness and purity, warming everyone, wanting to pull out every struggling person from hell.

Lally, Duke, Tony, Tom, Frank, Laura... among the people I had met, everyone's feelings and admiration for Alan, I truly felt it at this moment.

"God turned into a little boy." This sentence was not wrong at all. At this moment, I was not sad, but more proud and fortunate.

I didn't know where I found the strength, maybe it was from Alan. I gently patted Zoey's back, comforting her for a long time.

Her sobbing gradually subsided, and she wiped her tears away.

"Mrs. Smith, I got your clothes all wet," Zoey pouted, her eyes red.

I asked, "Are you not scared anymore?"

"As long as you're here, Mrs. Smith, I'm not scared," Zoey said firmly, but her confidence faded after a few seconds. She said softly, "Mrs. Smith, can I stay with you tonight? My mom's not home, and I'm a bit scared of being alone."

"I'd love to, but... one sofa can't fit two people," I smiled wryly. 

Ever since Alan passed away, I never went into the bedroom again, sleeping on the sofa every night.

"Come to my house! No one's there! Mrs. Smith, you haven't been to my place yet!" Zoey's eyes lit up again. 

After all, she was still a little girl, and her emotions came and went quickly. She had invited me many times before, but I always made excuses not to go, letting Zoey come to my place instead, mainly because I didn't like visiting others.

But tonight, Zoey was obviously scared. She was still young, and I worried she would be too scared to sleep alone at night. So, I thought for a moment and nodded.

Zoey was thrilled, saying her house had several sets of spare toiletries, no need to buy anything. She happily called a car, and it arrived quickly since there were few cars at night. Soon, we were at Zoey's house.

Zoey lived with her mother. I only knew her mom was in business and doing well, but I didn't expect it to be this good. This was a house her mom bought for Zoey, just a few minutes walk from the company.

Alan and I never cared much about material things, just enough was fine. But thinking back to what Howard had said about Ruben and Zoey not being a good match, it was no wonder Howard was worried. It really was... quite a difference. Ruben's chances seemed slim.

After quickly washing up, we slept in the same bed, with two quilts because Zoey kicked the quilt at night, so she prepared an extra one for herself.

Zoey leaned towards me, tightly wrapping the quilt around her neck, only her head exposed, looking at the ceiling light. 

She said slowly, "Mrs. Smith, I used to see in TV shows and novels that people who come out of hell eventually turn bad. They have dark, extreme personalities, strong suspicion, and don't trust anyone, but it seems different in reality."

"How is it different?" I asked gently.

"Take Lally, for example. Let me think about how to say it. She carries a light, in my view, there's an innate, unparalleled confidence in life. But after getting to know her, I found out she wasn't born like this," Zoey's voice lowered.

I said slowly, "There are always some people who don't believe in fate. They are strong and brave, fight to the end, and come out of the darkness. But at the same time, they are not limited to this. They reach out, passing the light in their hands to others, bringing every crying, sorrowful child out of the mire, out of the darkness, out of hell, to feel the beauty of the world, showing them the other half of the world. This is great courage, no, this is a gift, innate. Human nature should be like this, just like..."

"Just like God turned into a boy, walking among people," Zoey smiled and said warmly.

"He is not God, he is just an ordinary person, my husband, Alan," I replied.

I found I could face Alan's departure calmly. A person's departure was not the disappearance of the body, I understood this. What he gave me was quietly sprouting.

###chapter 66 Missed Call

After what happened to Alan, I kept having dreams about him. I'd dream about falling into an ice pit, getting old and frail, and the kids at the orphanage.

Why did people dream? Scientists claimed it was because the brain was all hyped up. But honestly, that kind of explanation felt like a whole lot of nothing. It was like so many things in life; you thought you understood, but you were just pretending, and everyone went on like that. They called it "Ignorance is bliss."

But I don't want to be like that. I figured my dreams were because I was super anxious, tangled up in the messy case details, mad at myself for not being able to do more, and... missing Alan, grieving for him.

When I went to Lally's place the second time and saw her letter and those old photos, I wasn't scared at all when the truth started to come out.

Actually, I felt calmer. Maybe it was the strength Alan gave me, or maybe it was just the relief of finally seeing the truth.

So, I didn't dream that night. I slept straight through till morning, and when I groggily checked the clock on my nightstand, it was 9:15.

It was the best sleep I'd had in ages. Zoey was sprawled out on the bed, half uncovered. She never slept properly. I pulled the blanket over her again.

"Hot," Zoey mumbled, squirming a bit, her mouth slightly open like she was about to say something, but she was out cold again in a second.

Zoey was always like this when she crashed at my place, sleeping like a log, impossible to wake up. Sometimes, she'd wake up just before lunch, lured by the smell from the kitchen, and then she'd rush to help, all embarrassed.

I had no idea how she managed to wake up for work usually. But today was Saturday, so I let her sleep in.

I tiptoed out of the bedroom with the photos and letters Lally left, sat on the couch in the living room, and started going through the photos one by one.

The last three photos were probably kept by the person who hurt Lally as a threat, but Lally secretly took them and hid them, always holding on to her hope for justice.

The key was in the first three photos, one of which showed a child trafficking camp, which Lally called the orphanage.

The yard in the photo didn't look special. It was probably taken from the gate, showing a wide view. The key was the location, but the photo was black and white, too blurry to make out the surroundings.

The only thing visible was the buildings behind the yard, one on each side. The black and white photo made it hard to see, but the light contrast suggested the buildings were really run-down, probably abandoned. 

Otherwise, their activities wouldn't have stayed hidden for so long. They likely picked a remote spot far from the city, somewhere people rarely went.

But according to Lally, that place wasn't too far from Sand Village. I guessed it was no more than 6.2 miles away.

Over a decade ago, even though Sand Village started to decline with the steel plant moving and Silverlight City growing, it was still a busy place with lots of people. There shouldn't have been such a deserted spot within 6.2 miles.

Where could this place be?

Just then, Zoey shuffled out of the bedroom in her pink pajamas, rubbing her eyes and looking half-asleep. "Mrs. Smith, should we go downstairs for breakfast later?" she asked.

I replied, "It's Saturday, no work today. Get some more sleep. What do you want to eat? I'll bring it up for you."

Zoey shook her head, yawning. "Mrs. Smith, is your phone on silent mode?"

I always set my phone to silent before bed to avoid work interruptions. Anything could wait until morning, but poor sleep really messed with my work efficiency.

I was puzzled. "Yeah, why?"

"Last night, I think I woke up and heard your phone vibrating. I thought I was dreaming." Zoey handed me my phone. "There are a lot of missed calls, no names saved. You should check it out, Mrs. Smith."

I remembered leaving my phone charging on Zoey's dressing table last night and hadn't checked it this morning.

There were 23 missed calls, all between 2:40 and 3:00 AM. Who could be trying to reach me so late?

I exited the call log and saw three unread messages.

[Mrs. Smith, it's Tony. Are you free tomorrow? We need to meet. Lally is missing. I can't find her anywhere, but I know where she is. Only you can save her now.]

[Please, save her... You don't know what she's been through.]

[Can we talk now? Lally said you left too quickly that day, and there were many things she didn't tell you. Lally is gone. I've thought about it. I trust you. This secret can't be hidden anymore. He's a madman. Both of them are madmen!]

He started calling me shortly after sending the messages.

Tony knew where Lally was?

I suddenly realized they might still be connected to the child traffickers from back then, and these people might still be controlling him!

Tony was desperate to tell me the truth from back then, and he was so anxious because those people might have found him!

I quickly called back, but no one answered.

Damn it! Tony must have been at home at that time, and he was so desperate to call, he must have anticipated some danger! 

These missed calls were made one after another, and they stopped abruptly at 3:00 AM. Could something have happened to him?

I asked, "Zoey, is your car at home?"

"Yes, let's go together!" Zoey didn't ask why, just seeing my expression after looking at the phone, she instantly reacted!

I said, "Okay, let's head to Sand Village immediately!"

Zoey asked, "Is it Tony?"

I replied, "Yes! Hurry, I'll explain on the way!"

We quickly changed clothes and rushed downstairs to the underground garage.

With the roar of the engine, the red Porsche sped out of the garage.

I sat in the passenger seat, explaining that Tony might be in danger while calling Tom.

I said, "Hello? Tom?"

Tom asked, "Hello, who is this?"

I replied, "It's Nancy!"

Tom said, "Nancy, I've already said, I don't want to recall that case anymore."

I said, "Zack, stop pretending. Tony probably had an accident last night. Do you know anything about this? You, Tony, Lally and Frank. What are you hiding from me? Tell me now!"

There was silence on the other end.

Then I added, "Zack, say something. He's your brother!"

Tom replied, "You... should stop investigating."

The call was disconnected.

###chapter 67 A Guess

Tom hung up the phone.

Why did they all keep telling me to stop digging?

Lally mentioned in her letter that if I didn't want to keep going after learning the truth, I should leave Silverlight City.

Tom just told me to stop investigating too.

What was the big secret here? First, they kept me in the dark, and now that I'm getting close, they want me to back off.

Was this some kind of well-meaning warning?

"Nancy, stop investigating; it's dangerous here; leave quickly, don't be reckless."

Tom's last words sounded so confident and arrogant to me.

Tony and Lally couldn't hold on any longer and wanted to spill the truth. Lally vanished after writing half the letter, and Tony called in the middle of the night, but I missed it.

Tom still wanted to keep the truth hidden, the hatred and revenge Lally wrote about in her letter.

The revenge was not over, and the enemies had begun to retaliate.

During the trial, I noticed issues with the testimony. Laura wasn't the murderer. These people conspired to frame Laura in court, trying to use the law to kill her. Was this their revenge?

When they said these things, did they ever think about how this was a mockery of fairness and justice?

Or did they think they were the embodiment of fairness and justice?

What about Alan? Did they not care about him? Why didn't they show any sadness for the friendship they once had?

Wait! I just thought of a possibility that could link Alan's death to the trap they set.

First, when Lally sugarcoated the story, she said they came out of the orphanage. Now it seemed they might have escaped.

Second, because they escaped, neither the criminal group nor these kids dared to make a sound. Everything had to be done in secret.

But among these kids, there was a traitor who leaked their info to the criminal group. From Lally's photos, it seemed they continued to be persecuted after leaving.

Lally was like this, and the others were even more so.

This traitor, judging from the false testimonies of Lally, Tammy, Tom, and others, was likely Laura.

I met Laura at my wedding, and from her statements in court, Laura and Alan's friendship was genuine. She might not have leaked Alan's info.

By now, everyone had grown up. They set a trap to avenge the persecution they suffered back then, and the first step was to eliminate Laura and then take revenge on the criminal group.

The criminal group was also looking for them because they held the group's secrets and had to be eliminated quickly.

When these two forces collided, Alan probably knew about his friends' plan, and Lally respected Alan a lot, so Alan thought of persuading Lally.

Unexpectedly, Laura was also at the Entertainment Club. Alan knew the truth about Laura's betrayal, and there might have been some conflict.

At the same time, the criminal group also found out about Alan's whereabouts, so they planned a power outage and murder at the Entertainment Club, killed Alan, dissected his body, and hung it in a private room as revenge and a warning.

Everyone knew this was a path of revenge, so they turned Alan's death into motivation for revenge and continued their actions, conspiring to first put the traitor Laura to death.

According to the clues provided by Leonard, all the police, prosecutors, and court personnel related to this case had now been transferred, indicating that there was likely a huge protective umbrella behind this group.

Because of this, Lally could vanish without a trace, and the cops had no leads these days.

Tony, who called last night, might also be in danger.

If this line of thinking connected the dots, then everything that seemed off started to make sense.

But this was just speculation without solid proof.

Plus, there were many people not included in this theory. Like Bob and Mike, who were part of Alan's closest group of five in college. They hadn't shown up in this mess from the start.

Could they really be unrelated?

Also, when Lally testified in court, Laura must have recognized her, but she didn't say a word. Why?

Was it the shame of a betrayer? I didn't think Laura would feel that way.

And Tammy wasn't from that hellish place. Why did she give false testimony?

Was it for Zack? But Zack was fine and doing well. No matter how deep the grudge, she wouldn't want to kill her.

And most importantly, was Alan's death really just a coincidence?

All of this was unknown. The main thing now was to find the address of the criminal group that trafficked kids back then, start from there to find clues, and understand the relationships behind these people. Then everything would be clear.

The car stopped at the entrance of Sand Village. Zoey and I got out and headed straight to Tony's house.

Just then, Ruben called.

I had called Ruben on the way and asked him to check if Tony had gone to work at Stardust Diner today.

Ruben said, "Mrs. Smith, I just came out of Stardust Diner. They said Tony quit a few days ago."

I asked, "Did they say why?"

Ruben replied, "They said Tony's wife caused a big scene at Stardust Diner, broke a lot of tables and chairs, and even got the police involved. Tony paid for the damages and quit that day."

It seemed Anna knew about Tony changing jobs and caused a scene.

Talking about Anna, I always felt their relationship was odd. Tony knew Anna was a mistress of a Digital Leap Technologies Company shareholder, yet he still married her. And Anna, knowing Tony's situation, still married him.

From my few encounters with Anna, she didn't seem like a young girl blinded by love. On the contrary, she was very shrewd.

Since we were here, if Anna was around, we might as well talk about her and Tony. At the very least, she shouldn't do such impulsive things again.

If this matter was resolved and Tony hadn't done anything illegal, I had to help him because Alan was well taken care of by his family back then. I owed them this favor.

Thinking about this, I knocked on Tony's door.

No one responded, and I felt a sense of unease. It seemed something really happened.

I pushed the door open, and Zoey followed closely behind. The yard was empty, and the doors on the second and third floors were closed.

Only the door to Tammy's place on the first floor was open.

Could it be that the whole family was in trouble?

"Ms. Martinez, are you there? It's Nancy, the reporter who came before." I tried to steady my heartbeat, speaking as I walked in.

Tammy had blood at the corner of her mouth, half-lying on the sofa, staring at George's photo on the wall. She was on the brink of death, barely hanging on.

###chapter 68 Anna's Disguise

"Ms. Martinez!" I dashed over, and Zoey was already on the phone with the cops and an ambulance.

Tammy's face was ghostly pale, her head tilted slightly, and she gave me a sideways glance. She tried to say something, but more blood just poured out.

What the heck happened? How did Tammy end up like this? Anna and Tony never mentioned she was this sick.

Why did she suddenly start coughing up blood and collapse on the couch?

And if Tony's gone, what about Anna? Where did she disappear to?

"Ms. Martinez, the ambulance is on its way. Hang in there." I held her in my arms, supporting her body. 

No matter what she did in court, when Alan first came to Sand Village, they took care of him. Plus, we both had just lost our husbands. After George died, she stuck to her husband's principles and refused any help.

She might seem old-fashioned and stubborn now, but just this short time had been hell for me. Tammy had been holding on for nearly twenty years, and I respected her for that.

Tammy moved her hand a bit, and I got what she meant. I held her hand tight. It was already cold, her skin rough, and her fingers had frostbite cracks. That was when I realized how freezing the house was. 

She lived alone and couldn't afford heating. She'd been carrying the family burden alone for years, going through so much.

Tammy said, "Alan... is a good kid, and so are you..."

"Ms. Martinez, I'm Alan's wife." I choked up. Alan was an orphan, and I never met his parents. But for some reason, Tammy mentioning "Alan" made me think of Alan's mom.

Now that Alan was gone, and Tammy was on the brink of death, I couldn't hold back my tears.

"Alan..." Tammy couldn't speak because of a violent cough. She just shook her head at me, coughing up more blood with a weird, pungent smell.

Then I noticed the strangulation marks on Tammy's neck and a bottle under the table-pesticide!

I cried, "Ms. Martinez, save your strength and don't talk. The ambulance is almost here. You'll be okay!"

Tammy's breathing got weaker. She shook her head and, with great effort, rasped out, "Didn't... sign, she... dream on!"

Then she collapsed in my arms, a disdainful smile on her lips, her eyes filled with hatred and anger slowly closing.

"Ms. Martinez! Ms. Martinez!" I panicked and checked her breath. It was barely there, but her pupils hadn't dilated yet.

I said, "Zoey, call the ambulance again and hurry them up. She's not gonna make it!"

Zoey replied, "Okay!"

As soon as she finished, doctors and nurses rushed in.

After checking her out, they said, "The patient seems to be poisoned and needs a gastric lavage. We need to get to the hospital now, or it'll be too late!"

They quickly put Tammy on a stretcher. The ambulance was parked at the alley entrance, and we all got in, racing to the hospital.

Zoey and I sat in the ambulance, and I just stared at this printed document we found under Tammy when we lifted her from the couch.

Tammy's words, "Didn't sign, she dream on," made sense when I saw the document.

It was a will, stating that if Tony was declared dead by the court, all of Tammy's assets, including insurance benefits, would go to her daughter-in-law, Anna.

The signature line was blank.

This will was legit, meaning Anna had it prepped with a pro legal team. No way she did this on her own.

I handed the will to Zoey, who looked shocked.

Zoey asked, "Mrs. Smith, do you think it was Anna?"

I didn't answer and asked, "The police should be there by now, right?"

Zoey replied, "Yeah, Ruben just texted me. The scene is secured."

Tammy had made it clear. If Anna's fingerprints were on the pesticide bottle, it was probably her.

Lally and Tony had mentioned that the insurance was bought after the Sand Village demolition and brawl incident, with Tom's help, using a big compensation sum. Tony and Tammy bought the insurance together.

Anna's first contact with me was also about Tony's compensation and asking me to help find Tony a job.

The insurance was bought before the marriage, so Anna shouldn't have known about it. Tony wouldn't have told her either.

So, how did this will, forcing Tammy to sign, come about?

There was only one possibility: Anna knew about the insurance from the start, and her marriage to Tony was likely because of it! Everything she told me before was a front. I felt a chill. Anna was definitely not simple.

If it was just a front, it wouldn't matter. But why did she contact me, telling me that Tony was at the Entertainment Club on the day of the incident?

And she contacted me several times afterward, all under the pretext of finding Tony a job.

Could it be that she knew who I was and also knew about Tony and Alan?

Unlikely. If that were the case, she'd done a damn good job of hiding it.

By the time we reached the hospital, it was noon.

After emergency treatment, Tammy's life was saved. But due to her age and long-term exhaustion, her health was already poor and she fell into a deep coma. 

According to the doctor, her condition was not optimistic. She might wake up in a few days, or she might never wake up.

Ruben called back. The scene was secured, and they found a single fingerprint on the pesticide bottle, matching Anna's fingerprints from her daily items on the second floor. They also found hair on the sofa, which needed DNA testing.

Regardless, Anna was now a prime suspect and a citywide manhunt was underway. Zoey and I arrived shortly after the incident, indicating that Anna hadn't gone far and should be caught soon.

Tony's whereabouts were still unknown, and Ruben was tasked with finding him. Ruben suggested checking road surveillance near Sand Village for the past few days, hoping to spot Tony.

But I doubted it would yield results. If a child trafficking gang was behind this, Tony might never be found. After all, their protection network was too vast.

Zoey stayed by Tammy's side while I went to handle the hospital admission procedures.

That was when Tom showed up.

###chapter 69 Tony's Marriage

Tom showing up didn't shock me one bit. I knew he'd come. The cops had already told the family after everything went down.

When they carried Tammy out of the house, all the neighbors were out there, watching and gossiping. Some even blamed Zack, saying George and Tammy had raised an ungrateful kid.

Someone had already called him, cursing him out with all kinds of nasty words. There was also a lot of anger towards Tom, but most of it was probably about the crappy compensation from the Sand Village demolition case.

When Tom saw me, he hesitated, his eyes darting around, but he still walked over. This was the only way to get to Tammy's ward.

"Should I call you Zack or Tom?" I looked him up and down. He was all dressed up, but then he took off his gold-rimmed glasses and rubbed his eyes, looking exhausted.

When he looked up again, I noticed something off about his eyes. His right eye was red, like he'd been crying, and his left eye seemed kind of dull, not as sharp.

I got it, it was a fake eye.

Just like Tom and Zack, one real, one fake, one dead, one alive.

"Just call me Tom. Alan used to call me that too. We came up with the name together. I only go by Zack in Sand Village." Tom put his glasses back on and smiled. "The doctor said the critical period is over. Thanks for everything. I'll go see my mom first."

He was very straightforward, and I didn't say much. Since he accepted who he was, the next steps would be easier.

I followed him. Zoey, who was taking care of Tammy, saw Tom come in and stepped out, standing with me at the door.

There was no dramatic scene like on TV, where the devoted son rushes to his mom's side, crying and making everyone emotional.

Tom sat on the chair by the bed, took off his glasses, and held Tammy's hand to his cheek, gently rubbing it like he was still a kid.

Then he buried his face in the blanket, his shoulders shaking a bit, crying silently.

Zoey and I exchanged a look and left the doorway, waiting in the hallway.

About ten minutes later, Tom came out. He was about to take off his glasses, but seeing Zoey next to me, he adjusted them and put his hand down.

"Who's this?" Tom asked.

"My apprentice, Zoey Taylor. She was with me when it happened," I said flatly.

Tom thanked her and handed her his business card, saying, "If you need anything, just let me know. I'll help however I can."

Zoey didn't take it, raising an eyebrow, "I heard you asked Mr. Martin to buy insurance. I don't dare to accept it."

I was taken aback for a moment, remembering that day at dinner when Howard vividly recounted how Tom had intimidated him. But Howard, undeterred by threats, had risked angering a business partner for the sake of Alan's case.

Zoey probably knew Howard's temperament and figured he had likely exaggerated the story, but she remembered the part about Tom asking Howard to buy insurance.

Howard's care for Zoey hadn't been in vain; she was already standing up for him.

Tom was caught off guard for a moment, then it clicked, "You're Howard's niece?"

He sighed and waved his hand, "Forget it. With your master's skills, it was only a matter of time before he figured out who I am. Howard was just venting. I'll apologize next time I see him."

He handed the business card to Zoey again. "Now you can take it, right? There are a lot of ways I can help in Silverlight City. This is my way of saying thanks. If you need anything, I'll do my best to help."

Seeing Zoey accept it, Tom nodded and said, "Alright, I'll discuss some other matters with Mrs. Smith. If you need anything, call me. And don't worry, I'll apologize to Howard."

It seemed Tom still didn't fully trust Zoey. The business card and promise were partly to thank her and partly to make sure she wouldn't interrupt our conversation.

He was a sharp guy, but he had this vibe like he had everything under control, which I didn't really like.

This hospital was one of the top three in the city and among the best in the entire northwest region. The medical tech was top-notch, and the facilities were great, providing a good environment for patients' families.

After leaving the inpatient building, there was a big plaza with rest areas and dining options, a nice spot for patients' families to chill.

Tom and I walked to a café and sat on the outdoor chairs.

Tom took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, looked up at the midday sun, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath, trying to relax.

From the hospital hallway to the café, there was a stretch of about 150 feet with dim lighting. Tom's breathing was heavy and slow. Despite his efforts to control it, I could still hear the rough, muffled sound.

I suddenly remembered that during the trial, Tom had mentioned he had claustrophobia. Had it gotten so bad that he felt this uncomfortable in the dark?

It might be related to his childhood experience in that child trafficking camp.

Plus, there was a detail. Tom seemed to only take off his expensive gold-rimmed glasses and reveal his prosthetic eye in front of people he trusted.

"You must have looked into Tony and Anna's situation when you went to Sand Village." Tom took out a pack of cigarettes from his clothes, "Mind if I smoke?"

I shook my head.

"No need to act all refined. It feels great to smoke whenever I want." Tom squinted, skillfully lighting a cigarette. Thin smoke slowly drifted from his mouth. 

He paused and said, "I know about Anna's past. I know what kind of person she is. I know why she wanted to marry Tony despite knowing about his condition."

"Lally said Tony thinks highly of you. You should have advised him." Seeing Tammy lying in the hospital and Anna doing this for the insurance policy, I couldn't help but say.

"Fate's a funny thing." Tom shook his head slowly, his face showing bitterness, "Tony's character is still like my dad's. No matter how big the issue, he keeps it to himself. Once he makes up his mind, no one can change it."

"Who do you think Anna looks like?" Tom asked.

She looked like who? Why ask this suddenly? 

The only people who had contact with Anna were Tony and Tammy. I didn't know anyone else.

###chapter 70 Is It Love?

"Tony's had a thing for Lally since they were kids. Ever since she and Duke moved to Sand Village, he's been all about her," Tom said.

Taking a drag from his cigarette, Tom squinted and smirked, "He never says it, but it's so obvious. At first, he thought Lally and Duke were siblings. When he found out the truth, he tried to keep his distance, but I know he's still into her."

So that was how it was. Duke probably picked up on it too. When he caused that mess at Tony's company earlier this year, it wasn't just because he was high; there was more to it.

Thinking about the photo Lally showed me of her and Tony, with Tony flashing a 'V' sign, it was clear that with his usually reserved personality, he must've been really happy to smile like that.

Tom went on, "Even later, when Lally was getting bullied, he stepped in and carried her out of there. His feelings never changed."

I asked, "You mean when Lally was sexually assaulted by those people, right?"

The photos Lally hid under the tiles of her nightstand, the last three were proof of her being sexually assaulted.

Tom looked a bit surprised, his eyes flickered, and he sighed, "Seems like Lally told you quite a bit. How much do you know?"

After a moment, he smiled, "I was just startled. If you knew everything, you wouldn't be here talking to me."

I stayed quiet. He quickly figured out how much I knew. This guy was sharp.

"Let's get back to Lally," Tom said, steering the conversation. "Do you think Lally and Anna look alike?"

I thought about it. Lally had delicate features and a gentle vibe, kind of like a quiet girl. Lally's features were more refined, and she knew how to dress up, making her stand out. But they didn't seem to have much in common.

Could Anna and Lally be related somehow?

Tom seemed to read my mind and smiled, "No, they don't. Tony just said Anna and Lally look a bit alike. I never saw it."

"Maybe it's their vibe or experiences," I suggested.

"Maybe." Tom nodded thoughtfully, then grinned at me, "Mrs. Smith, don't try to get info out of me."

Since he caught on, I didn't feel embarrassed and shrugged, "If you told me straight up, I wouldn't have to beat around the bush. Why did Frank insure Ms. Martinez? Where's the child trafficking camp? Are the main players from back then still in touch with you? Is Alan's death connected to this?"

Since Tom was being direct, I laid it all out. "You're playing with fire. Even if you get revenge, you won't escape the law. Trust me, I can handle it. I'm not just doing this for Alan, but for you and everyone close to him. I don't want anyone else to suffer. Lally's missing, Tony's missing, aren't you worried at all?"

"I didn't come here to talk about this, Mrs. Smith. Don't ask anymore." 

A flash of sadness crossed Tom's face, and he continued, "It's okay to tell you about Anna. You know she had a sketchy relationship with a shareholder of Digital Leap Technologies, right? She thought she could control everything with her looks, but she was just a toy for the rich. The poor girl was sexually assaulted by a group of people in a house. If Tony hadn't saved her, she'd be done for."

Tom's breathing got heavy, and he was clearly upset, "Tony said she and Lally are very similar. I don't get romantic feelings, but today I understand. Is his sympathy that cheap?"

"Or maybe you're just too heartless?" I shot back coldly.

"Heartless?" Tom sneered, "With her background, did she really think she could fit into my family's world? I changed her identity and background. I helped her so my mom would think she was just a young girl who'd gone astray. If it weren't for Tony begging, I wouldn't have cared if she died."

"I thought she was grateful, that after causing enough trouble, she wanted to settle down with Tony. But I didn't expect her to know about the insurance policy."

Tom's eyes gleamed with malice, and he sneered, "She won't leave Silverlight City."

"Are you planning to make her disappear too? Let me warn you, the police are also looking for Anna. If you know anything, you should tell me now to avoid getting caught. The law doesn't care if you're a company president or a rich guy."

I was getting impatient. This was my first real conversation with Tom, and he was so self-centered, even arrogant.

This guy thought he was in control of everything from the start, even saying in front of me that Anna wouldn't leave Silverlight City. 

I sneered, "Tell me, is the shareholder of Digital Leap Technologies part of the child trafficking ring? Is this your revenge?"

Since Anna knew about the insurance policy, someone must have told her. It couldn't be Tony or Tammy, and it certainly couldn't be Tom. The person who knew their situation best must be their enemy.

Tom realized he had been too aggressive and didn't respond. He lit another cigarette and smoked for a long time, "The shareholder has nothing to do with those people. You don't need to investigate further."

After saying that, he stood up and said, "I've said enough. Please pass this information to the police on behalf of the victim's family. I won't go to the police station. I'll hire a caregiver for my mom."

I asked, "What does Frank have to do with this? Are you the mastermind behind the whole plan?"

Tony said in his text message that this matter couldn't be hidden any longer, and that both of these people were crazy. Who were these two people? Were they Frank and Tom?

Tom didn't turn around, "I don't know. Don't ask anymore. As for Frank's insurance, I asked Frank, and he said no. Maybe someone else did it in his name. I went to the insurance company that day to investigate, but I couldn't find out who did it. Maybe Frank's information was stolen."

"Also, Mrs. Smith, I suggest you leave Silverlight City. If you're worried about your job, I can help you find a better company with better benefits. Since you care about us on behalf of Alan, I'll do something for you too."

###chapter 71 On the Verge of Death

Tom took off without a second glance.

He left Tony and Lally's regrets behind, or maybe it was just Tony's regret all along. Tom always said Anna was like a stand-in for Lally, filling that empty spot in Tony's heart.

Would a guy really go after someone who reminded him of his past just because he missed them?

I was pacing up and down the hospital hallway. The lights were dim, and it was super quiet.

The sound of my heels clicking on the floor was driving me nuts, so I leaned against the wall, lost in thought.

When it came to Tony and Anna's marriage, meeting Tom gave me some answers.

Maybe it was a weak and selfish feeling, but not for Tony. When he talked about Anna, his voice and eyes were full of love. Even knowing about Anna's ties with the shareholders of Digital Leap Technologies, he still cared for her, showing how much he depended on and loved her.

And Anna? She was definitely vain, and like Lally, she had her share of painful memories. But unlike Lally, who was stuck in her bad luck, Anna seemed driven by a love for wealth and power.

Reform? I didn't think so. A woman like her wouldn't give up after one setback unless she faced something unbearable.

But why did she keep coming to me to find a job for Tony?

And how did she know about the big insurance policy Tony and Tom took out for Tammy?

From a money-making angle, I was just a journalist editor making around $100,000 a year. What could she possibly gain from me? On the other hand, that insurance policy was a big deal.

Tom said the shareholder Anna was involved with had no ties to the child trafficking ring. If we thought about it that way, the two questions I had seemed unrelated.

But what if that shareholder was part of the crime group?

Then it all made sense. Anna got close to Tony to find others who escaped back then, to track them down. And she came to me because I had just started digging into this case.

In other words, these people were after not just those who escaped the child trafficking ring but also me, the one investigating it.

Tony, Lally, and Tom all wanted me to leave Silverlight City for this reason.

For a moment, I felt completely lost.

In the police, prosecutor's office, and court departments I knew, everyone connected to the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case had been reassigned. 

Even Benjamin, who had helped me, was sent on a business trip. Leonard had to protect himself and investigate secretly, and I hadn't heard from him in days. I was worried and called to check on him a few days ago, and thankfully, everything was normal.

They trusted me with the truth of the case, working at the magazine for more flexibility. But now it seemed I was also being watched by those people. If my guess about Anna's purpose was right, they might have started investigating me a long time ago, maybe even watching me during the trial.

I smiled bitterly. It seemed that reassigning the people involved in the murder case had another purpose, to isolate me. Even if I disappeared from Silverlight City one day, no one would notice.

Was this why they wanted me to leave Silverlight City?

There was no real empathy in this world. When a husband died mysteriously, everyone told the wife to let it go because it was too dangerous.

Was that "for your own good" or just a self-righteous moral stance?

I wasn't backing down. Even if it meant death, I was going to uncover the truth.

But Zoey and Howard couldn't get too involved. Things were already dangerous, especially for Zoey. She was smart and kind-hearted, but our good relationship shouldn't put her at risk.

If I had to face the abyss and the end, it would be me alone.

By now, it was noon, and the sun was at its peak.

The first ray of sunlight finally entered the corridor, shining through the glass door. It didn't light up the whole area, but it did chase away the oppressive, dark mood, making even the dim corners seem lively.

If Tom could withstand the encroaching darkness, what would he think when he saw this ray of light?

Would he, like Lally and Tony, come to his senses and tell me everything?

I followed the direction of the light. Outside the glass door was a sky bridge connecting two buildings, long and straight, like a link between life and death, leading to the oncology ward.

A few patients sat in wheelchairs, their skin dry and sickly. Their hair, due to chemotherapy, was almost gone.

They tilted their heads back, closed their eyes, and greedily soaked up the remaining moments of sunlight, either in their final days or already beginning to say goodbye.

Alan used to hate coming to the hospital. He said seeing these patients always pained him.

I used to tell him he was thinking about life and death too early, being too pessimistic, with a soft heart not fitting for a man from the North. Alan would just smile and say nothing.

Now, Alan was gone, and I had found parts of his past.

Now, the questions of life and death, compassion, or a soft heart were all left for me to resolve.

Thinking of this, I felt a wave of sorrow, sighed deeply, and pushed open the door, walking towards the sky bridge.

Because I saw a patient, very weak, barely able to sit up, slumped in a wheelchair. Unlike the others, he wasn't looking at the sunlight but sitting in the shadows, coldly laughing at those enjoying their final moments in the sun.

This person must be quite influential, at least in society. Despite his weakness, his eyes were still sharp, hinting at his former prowess in the business world. But his overall demeanor was somewhat weak and even gloomy.

He saw me, waved weakly, and smiled.

This meeting wasn't as heart-wrenching as the first. His smile reminded me of his college days in the drama club, where many girls were charmed by his smile.

But I knew, as Alan mentioned, he was a pessimist. His warm smile was practiced, hiding deep pessimism or even hypocrisy.

In college, I heard his real smile was ugly, almost crazy, even grim.

Just like now, he looked like a wolf hiding in the forest swamp, dying from an incurable tumor.

A few days ago, I went to his company and even his house, but they said he had gone to Edria.

Now, I found him in the hospital. It was Frank.

###chapter 72 Evil

"Tom just left, and here you are. What kind of day is this? People I didn't want to see before, but now that I do, I'm actually happy. People are so contradictory, driven by emotions and memories," Frank said.

Frank was slouched in his wheelchair, so thin he looked like a walking skeleton. At first glance, it was pretty terrifying.

This guy was clearly the weakest, looking like he was on death's door. His voice was soft and frail, but his words were crystal clear, like a whisper carried by the wind, sending chills down my spine.

"Guess it's true what they say, dying people speak kindly," I said flatly, without any expression.

From the very beginning, when we first investigated Frank, he cried his heart out, overwhelmed with grief. As we continued to dig deeper, it unexpectedly led us back to Frank. Tony and Lally vanished, Tom was closely tied to him, and Frank was the end of the line, the key to all the mysteries.

I had no kind words, and I wasn't about to show any goodwill just because he was related to Alan or because he was dying. His scheming ran too deep. This seemingly weak guy was probably the mastermind behind the whole plan. I couldn't believe it, over twenty years of plotting, and he was still at it.

Frank said, "Push me for a walk, I want to feel the sun."

I watched him coldly, not moving an inch.

Frank continued, "Back in college, I came to this hospital for treatment too. Alan used to push me around. Those were the best days of my life. But for a while, it wasn't Alan who came, it was Laura."

Frank coughed a few times, then stopped, glanced at me, and then at the wheelchair's handle. The meaning was clear: he knew my suspicions. If I wanted to know about the grievances between them and Laura, I would have to push him for a while.

I stepped forward and slowly pushed the wheelchair. He was so light, it was like pushing a kid.

"Close my eyes; it feels like Alan is still here and the speed is just right. I remember this feeling." Frank closed his eyes contentedly and spoke softly. He didn't say anything more, like he was about to fall asleep.

After a while, his body suddenly trembled, like he had a nightmare right after falling asleep. His breathing was rapid, but he was too weak to move. Being awake was torture, and sleeping was still torture.

I didn't disturb him before, but seeing him wake up all dazed, my heart softened, and I said, "Why bother... let go of the hatred and enjoy the rest of your life."

Frank tilted his head, closed his eyes to regain his composure, and said softly, "You don't understand... never mind, you met Tom today, didn't you? He mentioned you."

I replied, "Yeah, he mentioned Anna and Tony."

Frank nodded, "Even though they're not related by blood, their bond is closer than that of real brothers. Back then, during the Sand Village demolition fight, Tony got hurt. It was supposed to be a city planning project, but our group had investments in it too. Tom came to me, saying Tony deserved compensation no matter what. I helped."

"Wasn't the Sand Village demolition led by Tom? How were you involved?" I asked, puzzled. I didn't get the whole commercial investment thing, but I didn't expect Frank to be mixed up in it.

"Don't worry," Frank waved his hand dismissively. "It wasn't me who found those people, it was someone else, that person..."

As he spoke, Frank started coughing violently, gripping the wheelchair's handle tightly. His pale cheeks turned red, like a demon from hell crawling out of a coffin.

"Laura?" I asked.

Frank nodded, still coughing, now without any sound, just dry heaving with his mouth open.

"I'll get a doctor, wait here!" I said.

"No... no... I won't die, it's a normal reaction to the medication." Frank caught his breath, waving his hand repeatedly. 

When I looked at him again, his complexion was much better, his breathing louder, significantly better than his near-death state earlier. "Temporarily not dying."

After a while, Frank's demeanor was completely different from before. I was a bit surprised. Could there really be such medication in this world that could restore someone to such a natural state in a short time?

"Over the years, I've been working hard in business. Although I haven't achieved the success of an entrepreneur, my savings here are enough to keep me alive for now. I use imported medication. If this matter isn't resolved, I won't die in peace." Frank panted, laughing heartily.

I asked, "What did Laura do to make you hate her so much?"

"Where were we? Tony and Anna's marriage, Tom said the shareholders behind Digital Leap Technologies Company had nothing to do with those bastards from back then, right?" 

Frank smiled, "He lied to you, he hid it from you, but I won't. That old-fashioned guy is still thinking about Tony. In this day and age, he's still stuck in his old-fashioned thinking."

"You're puzzled about how Anna knew about the insurance policy Tony and Tom took out for Tammy, right? It's simple, she knew Laura, and Laura told her. Laura knew about the policy because I helped with it." Frank said.

Suddenly, it all clicked. Tom said the shareholders behind Digital Leap Technologies Company had nothing to do with the child trafficking ring, not to hide the truth, but to protect Tony, or maybe because of his own traditional thinking.

In other words, the mysterious investor shareholder behind Digital Leap Technologies Company, who was always rumored but never surfaced, was actually Laura!

"Laura and Anna are..." I asked.

"Yes, that kind of relationship." Frank nodded indifferently.

Wait, wasn't Laura with Frank during their college years? That would mean her sexual orientation should be normal, so how could she be with Anna?

"All evil stems from her." Frank glared, his voice hoarse, "Sexual orientation means nothing. In her eyes, people are just playthings. She has a face that makes every man fall for her. She despises the men who pursue her, but goes to great lengths to get the men who ignore her..." 

"Laura has no emotions, she's a born demon. After playing with men, she started playing with women. She has no sexual orientation, only the desire to manipulate."

Frank chuckled, "Anna is vain, willing to be ruined by Laura for money, but would Laura think the same?"

###chapter 73 Exposing the Act

"She found a bunch of guys, drugged them, and tricked Anna into lying naked on the bed. Anna thought it was Laura who had come, but instead, the guys swarmed her. By the time Tony showed up, Anna was already ruined. She could never have kids again, and she even lost her normal menstrual cycle."

"And all of this happened just because Laura watched a movie and thought it was interesting, so she went ahead and did it."

Frank closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "It was from that moment I realized her desires weren't just about primal urges anymore; it was about power... The Entertainment Club murder case is still being hushed up, and I'm sure you've heard the rumors."

"She's got beauty and money. What man in the world couldn't she conquer, especially those middle-aged guys buried under piles of paperwork? She pleases others in bed, constantly trading money and her body for power... You see her as a theater actress, but who knows, she might be sleeping with some big shot in Silverlight City any night."

"Impressive, right? Making a seventy-year-old man feel vigorous all night long. No wonder everyone loves her."

Frank's eyes were filled with venom, completely forgetting his own identity and dignity. Dirty words and obscene descriptions kept pouring out of his mouth. His hatred for Laura seemed to make him lose all decorum, leading him to curse her openly.

I suddenly understood why this case had been suppressed for so long; it was because of this connection.

Frank added, "Tell me, should I let her die? She appears so perfect in public, almost flawless. Even dirty deals are packaged as romantic affairs. This world won't get better. We couldn't find evidence in the past, but now, with Alan's incident, it serves as the consequence of her betrayal of friendship and original intentions."

Although his mental state had slightly improved, Frank's body remained incredibly frail. The constant talking made his breathing grow increasingly labored.

Yeah, it seemed that up to now, all the information I had had been effectively pieced together, like fragments of cloth sewn into a map.

And the path on the map was clear, pointing directly to Laura as the epitome of evil.

"And what about you? What did Laura do to you?" I said calmly, "I believe what you just said is true, but not entirely."

Frank's coughing slowly subsided, and a look of confusion flashed in his eyes. He sat quietly in his wheelchair. I noticed his back was straighter than before. But it was hard for a weak person to sit up straight.

This meant he was starting to get nervous.

Then I continued, "Frank, what you just said sounded like it was specially designed. You must know my whereabouts because Tony, Lally, and Tom would tell you my whereabouts and what information they gave me. It's like pre-set broken bottles that I just need to piece together to see the whole picture."

"That's the truth," Frank said calmly. "Back then, the two main actors in the Silverlight University drama club were you and Laura. Alan was the screenwriter, a behind-the-scenes person, not as famous as you two. You and Laura were a talented and beautiful couple, not an ordinary pair in college. At that time, I started to get close to Alan. Alan accompanied me to watch many of your performances and explained your and Laura's acting styles in detail, your performance, your expressions..."

Frank's face twisted, and I caught every bit of it. I smirked and started pushing his wheelchair like we were just out for a stroll, talking casually. "Frank, you've gotten rusty over the years. At least Laura's performance in court was better than yours. She clearly recognized Lally and Tom but acted like she didn't."

"You thought your plan was airtight, but there were still holes. Before Lally disappeared, she wrote me a letter and hid it in her room, which I found. It had some photos. Lally was violated when she was very young, and you didn't mention a word about it. You just focused on Laura's crimes, trying to make me hate Laura by using Tony and Lally's tragic experiences, leading me to think Laura deserved to die."

"Tom lying in court can be seen as him wanting revenge for his brother, wanting Laura dead. But what about Tammy? As a mother, she'd naturally feel sorry for her son, but would she really want Laura dead, even to the point of lying herself? And Lally, her letter didn't mention Laura. Oh, and the text message Tony sent me before he disappeared, saying you all had gone mad."

"Let me think, why did he say you were mad, or you all...? Who are you all? You, and... Bob and Mike, whom I've never met? Laura is already in prison, which means you've avenged yourselves. If you still want to continue, it means you must have other plans, even something crazy."

Frank's body started shaking uncontrollably, shaking his head over and over, muttering, "Stop it."

But I kept going, "I have three questions for you. First, where exactly were you held captive? Lally left photos, so don't make me ask one by one. Second, what exactly are you planning? Are Bob and Mike involved too? Is your hatred for Laura just about this? Or did Laura not directly harm you, and you're just seeking justice? This is a society governed by law."

Seeing that I had seen through his act, Frank didn't say anything more, just a cold smile on his lips.

I pushed Frank, who was sitting in the wheelchair, slowly to the end of the overpass. The railing beside us was broken. If he fell, he would be shattered to pieces.

After a long time, I slowly said, "Third, was Alan's death directly related to you?"

Frank stayed silent, staring quietly at the nearly 300-foot drop below, where people looked as small as ants. He murmured, "Back then, I wanted to jump from here. Alan stopped me. I should thank him."

He turned to look at me and smiled. "You're different from him. You're more decisive. He saved me from here back then. Now, it's your turn."

"I won't kill anyone." I pulled the wheelchair back, pushed it to the railing, and turned to leave. There was no need to stay any longer; it was pointless.

"Nancy!" Frank called out to me.

"What?" I asked.

"Stop investigating!"

###chapter 74 Cindy

These past few days, I haven't seen Frank or Tom around.

Tammy wasn't doing so well. Even though they had removed all the pesticides from her system, she remained in a coma. The doctors had no idea when she would wake up; it was entirely up to her now.

Tom brought in the best medical team he could find to take care of Tammy 24/7. I swing by the hospital every day with a fresh bouquet and change the water.

The medical staff told me Tom rushes in at night, sits for a bit to check on her, and then takes off.

Perhaps he was avoiding me, or perhaps he was simply exceedingly busy. Regardless, it did not truly matter.

I'm visiting Tammy out of respect and compassion. When Alan was a kid, he lived in Sand Village, and Tammy and George took great care of him.

Alan's gone, but I'm still his wife, and I need to honor that kindness.

Lately, I haven't asked anyone for help, not even Leonard or Ruben. They've already done so much. Leonard worked his whole life to become the Deputy District Attorney, which wasn't easy, and Ruben's career is just taking off. I can't let my problems mess with their work.

Leonard and Benjamin had been calling to check in.

 Benjamin persistently insisted that Cindy stay with me for a while. Cindy was one of my few friends from college, and after we graduated, we both found ourselves in the same city. We used to spend time together occasionally, but it had been over six months since we last saw each other.

Going to my place wasn't an option, so I picked up some of Cindy's favorite desserts from college and drove to her house.

Cindy and Benjamin lived in the Silverlight City development area, on the same main road as Sand Village, just a few miles away.

I parked outside their community and spotted Cindy waiting at the gate.

It had been a while since we last met, but she still looked as beautiful as ever. She had delicate features, thin lips, silver-framed round glasses, long hair, a dark blue plaid cotton dress, and a gray cotton jacket. She looked every bit the intellectual.

Because of her severe nearsightedness, if you met her for the first time, you'd think she was aloof, but it was just because she couldn't see clearly and seemed a bit distant.

Calling her an intellectual wasn't wrong; she was super smart. She was four years younger than us in college.

She was not only my college roommate but also in the same major as me. After getting her bachelor's degree, she went on to get a master's in modern and contemporary literature, and then a Ph.D.

Even though they got married early, Cindy's studies delayed having kids until now.

Considering we hadn't seen each other for over half a year, her face had gotten rounder, her body a bit plumper, and her belly slightly bulging. Wait, she was pregnant!

Cindy came over and hugged me, whispering, "Nancy, I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you right away."

"I'm the one who should apologize. Benjamin should be with you now, but because of my situation, he had to go out of town," I said.

I realized Cindy had probably been waiting outside for a while in the cold winter. I took her hand and started walking towards her house, saying, "You didn't even tell me you were pregnant. What if you catch a cold in this weather?"

"It's okay, my mom's been staying with me lately. I bundled up before coming out, see?" Cindy patted her thick cotton jacket.

I had met Cindy's mom, Jody Rivera, back in college, and I always called her "Ms. Rivera".

It had been years since I last saw her. Time hadn't been kind; she used to dress so fashionably, but now her hair had more white strands.

But she was still warm and kind, holding my hand as we sat on the sofa.

She said Cindy often talked about me and that we should keep in touch more. Cindy wasn't very social, and I was her only friend. We should go out and have fun together.

Cindy and I were both in our thirties, but in her mom's eyes, we were still kids.

She didn't forget to complain about Benjamin, saying his company leaders were too inconsiderate, sending him out of town for training and meetings while his wife was pregnant, and he hadn't returned for so long. Was Benjamin the only police officer in Silverlight City? Did he have to do everything? They might as well make him the chief.

I felt a pang of guilt. It seemed Cindy's mom didn't know Benjamin was sent away because of my situation. Maybe Cindy and Benjamin hadn't told her about Alan.

Jody suddenly asked, "By the way, Nancy, how's Alan doing lately? He's such a good kid. When you were in college, I knew from the first glance that you two would get married."

"Mom, is there still meat and vegetables in the fridge? Nancy will have dinner at our place tonight." Cindy chided Jody and pulled her up, "Go, I'll talk with Nancy in my room."

She pulled me into the study and closed the door. "Nancy, how's the investigation going? Any clues about Alan?"

"Yes, there are some leads. I've sorted out the most crucial information, but I don't know where to start." I smiled bitterly. I could have gotten information from Lally and Tony, but they were now missing. Ruben had no leads, and Frank and Tom refused to tell me anything.

Even the only possible source, Tammy, was in a coma.

What kind of force was behind these people?

"What clues? Tell me, maybe I can help!" Cindy said.

The fewer people involved in this matter, the better. I hadn't let Zoey help these past few days, let alone Cindy, who was pregnant. I've already troubled Benjamin enough.

"Nancy, are you treating me as an outsider too?" Seeing my hesitation, Cindy got anxious, frowning, her eyes red, "Benjamin told me about Alan's accident. I messaged you, saying I'd come to stay with you for a couple of days, but you said you were fine. I asked you about it, but you didn't say anything. Do you not consider me a good friend anymore?"

"This matter is too complicated and dangerous. Benjamin was temporarily sent away because he interfered with the case. If you get involved, how can I face you two?" I said guiltily, gently touching Cindy's belly, "You should focus on taking care of your baby now."

She hugged me and whispered, "Let me help you, please?"

I thought about it. The place Alan stayed should be not far from Sand Village, but I couldn't find the original location.

Cindy lived nearby, and although she moved in later, this area used to be a village. Maybe she knew something.

I hesitated, "Let me be clear, you can't get involved in this matter. I'm just asking for information."

Seeing her nod and promise, I asked, "Was there a place in Sand Village twenty years ago where children often played?"

###chapter 75 Coincidence

"A place in Sand Village twenty years ago where children often played?" 

Cindy repeated the question, thought about it for a moment, and shook her head. "I don't remember anyone mentioning it, but I used to visit my grandparents there a lot when I was little."

Wait, did Cindy live in Sand Village as a kid too?

"Oh, right!" Cindy suddenly clapped her hands, looking excited.

"What is it?" I asked.

"My mom used to live in Sand Village. Actually, she's from there! Mom, come here for a second!" Cindy got up, opened the door, and called out.

"What's going on?" Jody came rushing over, wearing gardening gloves and holding some vegetables. 

Seeing Cindy was fine, she sighed in relief and said, "You only call me, your dad, or Benjamin with such energy. Outside, you take forever to say a word!"

Cindy was like that. She seemed quiet and didn't talk much, but once you got to know her, you'd see she was really warm-hearted. She was also pretty careless and liked to be alone, reading a book, which made her seem a bit aloof to others.

"Mom, I remember you said you used to live in Sand Village?" Cindy asked.

"Yeah, what's up?" Jody replied.

Could it really be such a coincidence?

"Ms. Rivera, I'm looking into a case related to Sand Village. Could you tell me more about it? When did you live there, and for how long?" I asked.

Hearing I was investigating a case, Jody quickly invited me to sit at the dining table, poured me a glass of water, took off her gloves, put down the vegetables, and sat up straight.

"No need to be so formal," I reassured her. "Ms. Rivera, I'm not with the prosecutor's office anymore, I'm just a journalist now. Let's just chat casually."

"No way, Nancy, I've read your reports. Even though you're not at the prosecutor's office anymore, your work is still top-notch. Unlike those small-time reporters chasing sensational news, you really speak up for ordinary people, for fairness and justice." 

Jody gave a thumbs up and said sincerely, "Ask away, what do you want to know? Oh, you asked when I lived in Sand Village and for how long, right? Let me think, my memory isn't what it used to be."

Jody looked at her phone calendar and counted on her fingers. After a while, she nodded, "I remember now."

"Please go ahead," I said.

Jody continued, "I lived in Sand Village until I got married, probably moved out around 1983. I got married and had Cindy then. Back then, our city wasn't called Silverlight City, it was called Sand Town. There was a steel mill in the area, and my parents were temporarily assigned to work there. The company-provided housing was in Sand Village. I would take Cindy to Sand Village to visit my parents on weekends. Cindy was only a few years old then."

"Later, my parents were transferred to work for the government, so they didn't live there anymore. The house was rented out, and when the steel mill's performance declined, the house was taken back. So, we lived there for about five and a half years, but we didn't go often and weren't very familiar with the area."

Jody answered seriously, carefully recounting the past. No wonder she had to think so hard; even though she lived in Sand Village, it was just a temporary place, and she didn't go there often.

"Do you remember if there was a place nearby, maybe about a half-hour bike ride away, no more than 6.2 miles, where there were a lot of kids, like a bunch of kids living together, and sometimes a few kids would come to Sand Village to play, but they weren't from there?" I asked, deliberately leaving out other details. The fewer people who knew about this, the better.

"I don't recall any place nearby with a lot of kids, and I don't think anyone mentioned it." Jody tilted her head, thinking and hesitating. "But... I do remember seeing some kids occasionally, not coming to play though."

My heart tightened, and I quickly asked, "What did they come for?"

"To beg." Jody sighed, her voice filled with emotion. "They were poor homeless kids, some as young as four or five, others seven or eight, wearing tattered clothes in the dead of winter, with bruises all over. When asked where they came from, they wouldn't say, just stared longingly at the kitchen, sniffing hard." 

"The people in Sand Village were kind-hearted, and whatever food they had, they gave to the kids. Those kids didn't steal or rob, just came every ten days or so to ask for food and then left."

"How could there be so many homeless kids in that era?" Cindy touched her belly, feeling more compassion and pity for children as an expectant mother.

Jody added, "They had such a hard life. I remember two kids clearly. One looked quiet and thin, always carrying a book. He would lead the other kids to ask for food, and whatever they got, he would distribute to the others first, then sit in a corner reading. My parents felt sorry for him and offered him food, but he refused, asking if he could borrow books to read and return. My dad, with a big heart, said he could come anytime and pick any book from the study."

I shivered. It was Alan.

"What happened to that kid later?" I asked softly.

"That kid did well. My neighbor wanted to adopt him, but he refused, instead bringing a younger child over, kneeling and begging my neighbor to adopt that child." 

Jody was deeply moved, her eyes reddening as she spoke. "He came at a bad time. The next year, we moved away. Before we left, my dad left all the books for my neighbor to give to that book-loving kid."

It was incredible how fate worked.

"Ms. Rivera, what happened next? Did your neighbor agree? Did that child have any distinctive features?" I asked.

I could vaguely guess what happened next.

Lally had mentioned that Tom (Zack) was introduced to the Thompson family by Alan, and for Alan to beg like that, their relationship must have been very close.

Jody replied, "The neighbor named him Zack Garcia. Interestingly, although his last name was Thompson, they insisted on calling him Garcia. My dad said it was because the neighbor, George, wanted to honor a friend who died unmarried, essentially giving his friend a posthumous son. George was a good man." 

"But that child was also very pitiful. He was blind in one eye and very afraid of the dark, always sleeping with the light on."

###chapter 76 The Old Factory

So, Jody used to live in Sand Village, and guess what? Their neighbors were George and Tammy.

Was it really possible for such coincidences to happen in this world?

Back in the day, Alan took some starving kids to Sand Village to beg for food and that's when they met George and Tammy's family.

Alan was a bookworm and that was how he met Cindy's mom, Jody, and her family.

Coincidence? Maybe. But if that was the case, there were way too many coincidences in this world!

Or maybe it was just about being a good person. If you were good, you met good people. Though, that idea had its flaws.

"My perfect world shouldn't be like this. The world isn't made by someone but is seen by someone..." 

I remembered what Alan said to the missionary when he was a kid, as Lally recalled. It seemed like Lally might have painted the missionary in a better light.

Maybe Alan was onto something even as a kid. What's important isn't what the world is like now, but how you see it. If you see beauty and keep it in your heart, even in the coldest winter, you'll eventually find spring.

But if your heart is dark and full of hate, it doesn't matter where you are-rich or poor, high up or down in the dirt. Even if you live under the sun every day, you'll still be swallowed by darkness. The world you see will be full of malice and hate.

"Yeah, the George you mentioned was a really good guy," I said, feeling nostalgic. 

Lately, a lot of stuff had come to light. The same person can look different from different angles. Some folks seem quiet and boring but are super lively inside, like Tony. Some look weak but have a beast ready to pounce inside, like Frank.

But George and Tammy? Everyone seemed to agree they were awesome. They were genuinely kind people. True goodness doesn't need a test; it shines in every dark corner.

I had to admit it. Some might think this is just a way to honor the dead, making them look better and quietly rewriting history. But if that were true, there'd be no light, no goodness, no law, and no sun today.

"Absolutely, George was a good man, well-respected, even though he wasn't well-educated. My parents had a lot of respect for him. You might not get it, but intellectuals of our parents' generation had a certain pride. My dad was very proud and was pretty upset when he got assigned to the steel mill, but he didn't want to leave George when he had to go. My dad said George made him see his own limitations," Jody said.

Then she remembered something and laughed, "My dad was all about logic, science, and against superstition. George and his wife had been married for years without kids. My dad helped them get a thorough medical check-up, and the diagnosis was that the chances of pregnancy were very low due to a uterine issue. But after they adopted Zack, George's wife got pregnant not long after. My dad invited George to dinner and said something at the table that I still remember."

"What did he say?" I asked.

Jody's eyes were filled with fond memories of her father as she slowly said, "You are destined to be childless, but that child is destined to have parents. You must treat him well and not abandon him just because you have a biological son."

I was floored. University students back then were really something else. Saying something like that was truly impressive.

A person, just by being themselves, changed someone else's view of the world. That's pretty amazing, and it has nothing to do with money, status, gender, or age.

In front of strict, law-abiding, rational intellectuals, he won them over with his own perspective. For things beyond understanding, you could only marvel at fate and karma, those mysterious concepts.

That's the magic of human goodness. Like-minded people are always drawn together by some inexplicable force to make the world a better place.

When people can't understand or reasonably explain something, they call this great, remarkable probability fate.

I believed in beauty, fate, and Alan.

Thinking about this, I decided to give it another shot. I pulled out a photo of the address of the child trafficking crime group from my bag and handed it to Jody. "Mrs. Hernandez, take a look at this photo. Do you recognize this place? Have you been there before?"

Jody studied the photo carefully, not saying yes or no, as if she was deep in thought.

I added, "This place is probably not far from Sand Village, maybe within 6.2 miles. Think about it."

Jody said, "Then it must be right!"

I almost jumped out of my seat, trying to keep my excitement in check. Everything was finally coming together!

I asked, "You mean... you've seen it?"

Jody replied, "Yes, at first I wasn't sure, after all, it's been many years and it's a black-and-white photo. But if you say it's near Sand Village, then it must be right, it definitely is!"

I asked, "Where is it?"

Jody handed the photo back to me, smiling, "This is the steel mill where my dad worked. From the looks of it, the steel mill had already moved by the time the photo was taken. The photo shows the steel mill's main hall. I remember it was a very large courtyard, built specifically for awards and performances."

She pointed to the two buildings in the background of the photo, which I initially thought were old residential buildings, and said, "The one on the left was the fuel storage warehouse for the steel mill, and the large building on the right was originally the office building for clerks." 

"But because it was too close to the raw materials, for safety reasons, they moved the office elsewhere, and this place became a warehouse for storing products. The photo only shows a part of it; there were actually many more buildings behind, but they've all been demolished now."

Sand Village was an abandoned place, not far away, quite large, with many children living there.

I had been thinking in the wrong direction from the start, assuming such illegal activities would be in the wilderness, no wonder I couldn't find it.

I didn't expect it to be in the abandoned steel mill around Sand Village!

"Where exactly is it?" I quickly opened the map app on my phone, "Can you point out the direction? I need to confirm the approximate location."

Jody wasn't very familiar with the map app. I roughly explained the directions, and Jody, while sliding the screen and recalling, pointed to a spot on the map after a while. "Yes, that's it."

"Are you sure?" I asked, my voice rising with disbelief.

Surprise, strangeness, incredulity, and for the first time, a sense of fear crept into my mind.

The place Jody pointed to was True Love Entertainment Club.

###chapter 77 Leonard's Call

True Love Entertainment Club used to be an old steel factory, and that factory was once a child trafficking camp.

Everything makes sense now.

I get why they were all so secretive about the location.

That's why Lally and Tammy worked at the Entertainment Club. Their revenge plan had been brewing for ages, and of course, it involved Frank, Tony, and Tom.

I also get why Tom and Tony took out such a big insurance policy on Tammy. The risk was just too high.

So, it makes sense why Tony, Lally, Tom, and Tammy were all there the night Alan had his accident.

Revenge!

Calm down, my heart was racing!

Why were they at the Entertainment Club? There's only one reason!

Their revenge was aimed at the Entertainment Club!

Why else would Lally go into such a hellish place?

Following this logic, Alan must have known about their plan that night. He went to stop them but ended up getting killed by the crime syndicate?

Or, like Frank said, was Laura the target all along?

I couldn't think straight, but it didn't matter now. I found a crucial piece of evidence; the place where the kids were trafficked.

The location of this Entertainment Club was so unique they even built a special road for it. To secure such a spot and specifically refer to the old steel factory, the boss behind the Entertainment Club had to be someone powerful. Plus, the reason the old steel factory could secretly imprison a bunch of kids without getting caught was probably because of his influence!

I tried to keep my excitement in check and only mentioned to Cindy and Jody about an interview article on Sand Village, wanting to dig into the past.

This case couldn't involve anyone else anymore. The fewer people who knew, the better. It was just too dangerous.

Looking back at the whole case, spanning twenty years, all the cops, prosecutors, and court staff involved were transferred. 

Laura's been detained this whole time. I used to think it was just because of powerful connections among high-ranking officials. 

Now, linking it to the Entertainment Club, I had an even scarier thought.

Maybe from child trafficking to the Entertainment Club, that big shot has been involved from the start.

So, no one else could get involved in this anymore, including Zoey and Howard. 

Howard was easy to handle, but for Zoey, I needed to find something to keep her busy and distracted so she wouldn't have the energy to deal with this case. Otherwise, with Zoey's personality, she definitely wouldn't let it go.

After dinner, I chatted with Cindy for a bit and politely turned down her offer to stay overnight. I took the elevator down and quickly ran to the parking lot!

Now, I needed to investigate the Entertainment Club!

Before they realized it, I contacted someone they didn't expect, and they definitely didn't see me focusing on the Entertainment Club so soon.

If I dug into the boss, shareholders, and other management behind the Entertainment Club one by one, I would definitely uncover the original crime syndicate!

Then, all the grudges and mysteries would finally be put to rest!

I jumped in the car and fired up the engine!

Just then, my phone rang. It was Leonard from the prosecutor's office.

I checked the time; it was past 9 PM. Why would he call this late? Did something happen?

"Leonard, what's up? Why are you calling so late? Did something happen?" I asked.

There was a pause on the other end, like Leonard wasn't used to this kind of conversation.

I realized I hadn't really checked in on him in a long time.

After college, I went straight to the prosecutor's office. Leonard wasn't the deputy chief prosecutor back then; he got promoted a few years later.

Back then, Leonard was my direct supervisor. He was super strict, but I was young and eager to prove myself, so I stuck it out and got the job done. The office staff were shocked; I was the first newbie to last more than two months under Leonard.

He was impressed with me, and I was grateful to him. Once, during a meal, he jokingly asked me to call him "Master." 

Fresh out of college, I laughed it off and said, "What era is this? I'll call you that when you retire."

Before things got tense between us, we had a great relationship, like mentor and friend. Leonard seemed stiff on the outside, but I knew he secretly wanted to go fishing, dancing, and traveling. He'd only relax and joke around with me occasionally.

"It's nothing, don't worry," Leonard's voice softened a bit. After a pause, he asked, "Where are you now? Are you busy?"

"I'm driving, just left Cindy's place, heading home to rest," I lied. I planned to handle this case solo, so I didn't tell Leonard the truth.

"Alright, no problem. I just wanted to see if we could grab a meal sometime," Leonard said. Then I heard him tap the phone twice with his fingers.

I got it immediately. A few years back, during an anti-corruption case, corrupt officials bugged the prosecutor's office. Leonard and I avoided phone conversations and met in person instead.

Unless it was urgent, we agreed to tap the phone once after talking, signaling to meet at the office ASAP.

It seemed Leonard had found something big. I turned the car around and headed to the city prosecutor's office. Information could wait; Leonard's safety was the priority. It looked like he had been investigating secretly, putting himself at risk.

I parked in a lot near the prosecutor's office. Instead of driving straight in, I used a little-known side entrance. No surveillance cameras here, so no one would know I was there.

From now on, I had to be extra careful about everything.

It was close to 10 PM. Even though I hadn't been here in years, nothing had changed. I navigated the familiar path, avoiding surveillance, and entered Leonard's office building through a side door.

Leonard's office was on the third floor. Before going in, I noticed only his office light was on, which wasn't surprising given his reputation for diligence.

###chapter 78 Forensic Pathologist

Leonard's office door was wide open, so I knocked and strolled right in.

Back when I worked at the prosecutor's office, I always knocked and entered without waiting for a "come in" from Leonard. It wasn't just me; everyone did the same.

Leonard was always swamped with work, no time for chit-chat, and his office was strictly business. 

If you were there, it was for work, so you just walked in. He didn't have the luxury to turn anyone away or refuse work.

At that moment, he was flipping through some documents while cross-referencing info on his computer.

When he saw me, he gave a quick nod and went back to his work.

It felt just like old times.

I plopped down on the sofa, waiting. The biggest clue had just surfaced, and I needed to tell Leonard to put the investigation on hold. We couldn't risk any slip-ups.

Leonard read the document three times, carefully comparing the info, then nodded.

"Nancy, come here," Leonard said, handing me the document he'd just read and swiveling the computer monitor towards me.

The rotating monitor arm was a birthday gift from me. Leonard wasn't getting any younger and spent too much time hunched over his desk. The arm could adjust the monitor's height to ease his neck strain. 

At first, Leonard refused, saying he had to keep his work ethic and couldn't accept gifts. I asked if he wouldn't even take a gift from his own apprentice.

Leonard reluctantly accepted it but anxiously asked about the price. I told him it wasn't expensive. Later, he somehow found out the cost and insisted on paying me back. 

This time, I refused. Leonard glared at me and said he hadn't attended my wedding, and it wasn't right for a mentor not to give a gift to his apprentice. He told me to use the money to buy something for myself since he was too busy to do so.

That was the only time we ever called each other mentor and apprentice. It never happened again.

Leonard said, "This document is the autopsy report for the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case, along with the list of related personnel and their personal info. Take a look."

I skimmed through the list, which included info on Benjamin, Ruben, and others. Leonard was thorough, even checking his own people.

He then opened an encrypted file on the computer and said, "These are the recent attendance records of court personnel related to the case."

"How did you get the court staff's attendance records?" I frowned. This didn't seem like Leonard's style.

"Desperate times call for desperate measures. It's nothing," Leonard said, unscrewing his water bottle, taking a sip, and clearing his throat. "Stephen sent it to me a while ago."

I was surprised, "Stephen?"

He was the presiding judge during Alan's trial, a judge at the Silverlight City People's Court, a key figure in the criminal court, and a member of the judicial committee. He had also been transferred to another location, but I didn't expect him to still be in touch with Leonard.

"Yeah, he's been in touch. We decided to investigate this together," Leonard said with a smile. "I wasn't wrong about Stephen. He's upright and unafraid of authority."

I said, "Leonard, stop investigating. I can handle it."

When did these two start teaming up on this case? Leonard hadn't mentioned it when I was in the hospital. This was way too risky.

"You're in your thirties, still playing the hero, trying to save the world? I thought you'd grown up since leaving the prosecutor's office, but look at you, back to your old self," Leonard laughed, pointing at me, and handed me his water bottle. "Go fill this up, will ya?"

"Haven't you stayed the same?" I glanced at the cup, which had a lot of history.

Leonard said, "Let me ask you, if this case had nothing to do with Alan, would you still be on it?"

I nodded without a second thought. The case was a tangled mess, with connections and a timeline spanning twenty years. It involved crimes like child trafficking, organ trafficking, and murder. 

Even if I wasn't in the prosecutor's office, as a legal worker, I had to dig to the bottom and find the truth.

I replied, "The editor-in-chief of Silverlight City's biggest legal newspaper should have that kind of responsibility and duty. This is the mission of a legal worker, and it's what I admire most about you."

Leonard nodded, smiling with satisfaction. "Then as the deputy prosecutor, who you've always said is obsessed with power, don't I have even more responsibility to investigate? If we let it go, where's the fairness and justice?"

He opened the materials and pointed to the list of names. "The autopsy report was rushed, with many procedures skipped. That's suspicious."

He then flipped to the next page. "I screened all the police, prosecutors, and court staff related to the case. They were all transferred, and their attendance records and facial scans in other locations checked out. They haven't been back to Silverlight City recently, so they can be temporarily ruled out. But I found one issue."

I asked, "What?"

Leonard turned back to the last page of the autopsy report and pointed to the signature of the forensic doctor. "I overlooked this person."

The signature read, Forensic Doctor: Joseph Davis.

Leonard added, "I checked his background. He should have graduated from the law school at Silverlight University, three years behind you and Alan. He was in the school drama club, so you probably know him."

I nodded. Not only did I know him, but I also saw Joseph the night Alan's incident happened when I went to the police station to identify the body. I didn't recognize him at first, but later, when I broke down on the roadside, I met Joseph again and recognized him.

Moreover, the first key piece of information in this case-Alan going to the Entertainment Club alone-was provided by Joseph.

I asked, "Could it be... Joseph has a problem?"

A bad feeling crept up on me.

All the clues and logic in this case started with him and then connected to Tammy, Lally, Tom, Tony, Frank, and others.

If he had a problem, thinking back on the entire investigation process, I felt a chill down my spine. The whole process seemed like it was set up, guided by someone.

I suddenly remembered the insurance policy copy that was inexplicably placed in the company archives related to the Sand Village brawl case.

Cold sweat broke out. If that was the case, then who was guiding me?

Leonard looked at me and nodded. "Yes, he has a problem. As a participant in the case and the forensic examiner, he should be most aware of the direct evidence, but he wasn't transferred."

Indeed! Joseph had a problem!

###chapter 79 A Guess

"Do you know Joseph?" Leonard asked.

I shook my head. "Not really. He's three years younger than Alan and me. He was closer to Alan, and they seemed to have a good relationship. Alan took care of him a lot... but..."

I paused, a thought suddenly popping into my mind.

Alan's close friends from college-Frank, Laura, Bob, and Mike-all came from the old steel mill area where kids were trafficked. They had a deep bond because they had gone through tough times together. But Joseph was three years younger than Alan. Why were they so close?

Could it be just because they were in the same drama club and Joseph had a talent for singing?

That shouldn't be it. There were plenty of talented people in the club back then. Why did Alan only take care of Joseph and not others?

"What's on your mind?" Leonard asked when he saw me stop mid-sentence.

I frowned and slowly shook my head. "Nothing, just a wild guess. It's not worth mentioning right now."

I couldn't let Leonard get too involved in this. It was better for me to investigate on my own. "Back to what we were talking about. I'm not that familiar with Joseph, but after Alan's incident, Joseph was the medical examiner who performed the autopsy that day. I didn't recognize him when I went to identify the body. He approached me halfway, and that's when I remembered him."

"Such a big incident, and he specifically came out to recognize you. It wasn't just to catch up, was it? What did he say to you? If you trust me, I can help you analyze it." Leonard took a sip of water and said nonchalantly.

"What do you mean by 'if you trust me'?" I frowned at Leonard's insinuation. How did this old man become so sarcastic?

"You didn't tell me your guess earlier. You must have some suspicion in your mind but didn't say it." Leonard said with a bitter face. "Nancy, are you trying to kill me? This water is scalding!"

I couldn't help but laugh in anger. How did this man become like a child? Where did the serious and upright Deputy Prosecutor Leonard go?

I said, "That night, I was emotionally overwhelmed and walked back alone, wanting some peace. I ran into Joseph by the roadside. After he introduced himself, I remembered him. He had changed a lot. He told me that during the autopsy, he overheard the police discussing the case. They said no witnesses recognized Alan. That's how I knew Alan lied about going to a class reunion. He went alone..."

Class reunion? No, wait!

This meant there was a high possibility that Alan didn't lie. He really went to a class reunion!

But this class reunion was likely not about reminiscing the past. Alan might have known about their plan and went to stop Frank and the others!

If that was the case, then besides Tammy, Tom, Lally, and Tony from Sand Village, Frank, Laura, and the yet-to-be-seen Bob and Mike were also present that day!

This class reunion always existed. Alan didn't lie to me.

"It seems you know where the problem lies," Leonard said calmly.

"What problem?" I was puzzled and explained, "I just suddenly remembered that Alan might have been telling the truth about going to a class reunion."

"It seems you're hiding a lot of secrets, but it doesn't matter." Leonard gave me a deep look. "Don't you think Joseph's actions are a bit strange?"

I repeated, "Strange?"

"Yeah," Leonard nodded, his eyes distant. "Why would a medical examiner be around when detectives are discussing a case? Even the greenest detective knows not to bother the medical examiner during an autopsy. And for such a big case, would the cops really talk about it in front of outsiders? That's confidential stuff." 

"Plus, even if Joseph was inside and the cops were outside, how could he hear them? Were they using a loudspeaker or something? It just doesn't add up."

I nodded. Joseph's behavior was definitely suspicious, but it didn't seem like the best place to start.

"Of course," Leonard said, pulling out Joseph's personal file and pointing to the personal information section. "Look at where Joseph works."

It clearly stated Silverlight City Court.

I asked, "He's at the court? Why would a court medical examiner go to the police station to do an autopsy?"

Leonard saw that I caught on and continued, "I wasn't sure at first, so I checked the time of Alan's incident and the attendance records of the medical examiners at the police station. All three of the police station's medical examiners were present, and there was no autopsy work scheduled that day."

Leonard closed the file, looked up at me, and said slowly, "So why would a court medical examiner go to the police station in the middle of the night to do an autopsy? The body was severely damaged, making DNA testing very difficult. Yet, in such a short time, he confidently identified the body as Alan's based on a ring and signed the autopsy report. This kind of efficiency is unheard of."

Leonard saw that I wasn't speaking, turned off the computer, and shredded the printed documents. The sound of the shredder matched my swirling thoughts.

Yeah, I never suspected Joseph.

That night was the darkest of my life. On the verge of collapse, Joseph's appearance reignited my drive to investigate the case and pulled me out of my grief.

In terms of timing, Joseph was the first to give me a clue, saying that Alan went to the Entertainment Club alone that night. 

This led me to wonder who Alan met and what he did at the club. Then, during the trial, I noticed discrepancies in the witnesses' testimonies and gradually uncovered the twenty-year connection between Alan, Sand Village, and his college friends.

Joseph was a key point. He inspired me to question the case and motivated me to dig deeper.

Now, Joseph's actions were highly suspicious. He was a court medical examiner. Why did he go to the police station to do an autopsy? All personnel related to this case have been transferred, so why was Joseph still in Silverlight City?

Based on this, how could Joseph hear the police discussing the case? The police wouldn't make such a basic mistake.

This could only mean one thing: Joseph was lying.

Maybe Alan wasn't alone at the Entertainment Club that night. There were others with him, and these people must be his college friends. Frank could be ruled out. Howard mentioned he had just returned, so the timing didn't match.

Wait!

I also overlooked an important point about Frank!

###chapter 80 A Guess (2)

I've run into Frank twice now.

The first time, Howard was with me. Frank had just found out about Alan's death, and he seemed genuinely torn up, like he'd just heard the news.

But then I started having doubts. The second time I saw Frank, just a few days ago, he got all worked up talking about Laura and Anna's relationship. It felt like he was putting on a show.

Plus, during that second meeting, he barely mentioned Alan, almost like he was waiting for me to bring it up.

Could it be that Frank wasn't even there that day? Maybe he was the mastermind, pulling the strings from afar. When he heard Alan was dead and the plan had gone south, he rushed back to figure out what went wrong.

Knowing I was digging into things and starting to question the witnesses, he showed up, trying to throw me off by pointing fingers at Laura. But I wasn't buying it.

So, by process of elimination, the only two people left who were with Alan at True Love Entertainment Club that day were Mike and Bob.

I remembered calling them to check things out, and they both had alibis. But now, it seemed like they were lying too.

Looks like I need to take a trip out of town.

Thinking back, why did Joseph give me that bogus lead about Alan going to the club alone?

There are two possibilities: either he was covering for Mike and Bob, or he was trying to steer me in the wrong direction. Maybe both. 

Considering how Alan acted all high and mighty in college, there was only one possibility: Joseph might have also escaped from the steel mill. 

Back then, Alan led a group of kids begging for food, and Joseph could've been one of them.

At first, it seemed crazy that all these people would end up in Silverlight City. But given the nightmare conditions at the steel mill, where so many kids died, the power of hatred can drive people to do anything, even wait for revenge.

Right then, Leonard put on his coat, packed his stuff, and smiled, "Looks like you've figured it out. Come take a walk with me and tell me what you've found out about Alan."

He patted my shoulder and said, "In this world, the people who truly care about you and are willing to help aren't just your apprentices, but also... your unacknowledged mentors."

I felt a pang of sadness and swallowed my words.

Given the sensitive nature of this case, involving some big shots in the state, if I was being watched, Leonard could get dragged into it too.

I said, "Forget it, I'll head out first."

"No need to be so cautious," Leonard seemed to read my mind and waved it off, "At worst, we'll just dodge the surveillance."

So, we retraced our steps and snuck out of the company through the side door. 

Leonard, the deputy director of the prosecutor's office and the company's second-in-command, sneaking out with me like a couple of thieves. 

Along the way, Leonard gave me a curious look, probably wondering how I knew the surveillance spots so well.

Outside the prosecutor's office was an old street. It was around 11 PM, and the place was pretty deserted.

Leonard and I walked down the street, just like we used to after working late, enjoying the quiet night.

Back then, I was fresh out of college, full of energy, mostly talking about work while Leonard listened more and spoke less, occasionally pointing out problems.

More than a decade had passed, and I never thought I'd be walking this path again.

I spilled everything to Leonard about Alan's past. I hadn't planned on it, worried about Leonard's future and the danger I was in. But when he called himself my "mentor," all my defenses crumbled.

Sharing secrets with someone close felt like both a confession and a relief.

After I finished Alan's story, I was in tears.

Later, Leonard would recall how I cried uncontrollably that night, sobbing and speaking in fits and starts, but my expression stayed the same. It broke his heart, like a father watching his daughter in pain.

It was the dead of winter, and the night was eerily quiet. Occasionally, a car would pass by, its headlights casting fleeting light on Leonard's face, and I saw his cheeks tremble slightly in the dim glow.

After hearing the whole story, he didn't say a word. He just slowed his pace, walking more and more slowly.

"Remarkable." That was the first word he said after a long silence, followed by an apology. 

"Sorry, I should have talked to you properly that night. I also got news about the trial that night. I thought the case would be resolved, but... I think you cried when you left the police station and then met Joseph."

I nodded.

Leonard said, "He was guiding you."

I replied, "Yes."

Leonard stopped under a streetlamp, looking up at the light, his eyes flickering, lost in thought. 

After a while, he said, "Your dad called me a few days ago."

I was surprised. Why would my dad call Leonard? They'd only met a few times and exchanged contact info. He should have known about my resignation.

Then it hit me. It had been about a month since Alan's incident. I hadn't gone home, only called my dad a few times with excuses. Worried about me, my dad couldn't reach anyone else and had to call Leonard.

I said, "I really don't know how to tell my dad about this, so I have to keep it from him for now. If I go home now, I'm afraid I won't be able to hide it from him."

"Parents know their daughters best." Leonard sighed and continued, "Is it cold at home?"

I replied, "No, the heating's on."

"Did you pay the heating bill?" Leonard asked, slightly surprised, his eyes brightening.

I shook my head, "No, my dad did."

After Alan's incident, I hadn't thought about these things. When the heating started, I remembered my dad urging me to pay the bill, so he probably paid it.

Leonard's expression was strange. He looked at me and smiled slightly, "Your dad asked me how you've been lately and if you've contacted me. He was very concerned about you, especially mentioning how cold it gets in Silverlight City in winter and wondering if you paid the heating bill. He searched for the old house's heating card but couldn't find it and didn't know the heating number, so he couldn't pay."

What did that mean?

Leonard smiled at me, his eyes glistening with tears.

Only three people knew the heating payment number for my house: me, my dad, and Alan.

It wasn't me, and it wasn't my dad, so it had to be Alan.

The night Alan had the accident, Silverlight City hadn't started notifying about the heating payment.

As for that hasty autopsy report...

Why did Lally, Tony, Tom, and the others show no sadness when mentioning Alan?

Why didn't Frank mention Alan during our second meeting?

If this guess was true, all previous doubts were resolved.

"Is... is... is it true?" Tears streamed down my face as I looked up at Leonard.

"Calm down... I hope the guess is correct." Leonard first smiled slightly, then laughed heartily. It was the first time I had seen him so happy.

###chapter 81 Night Talk

The streets in Silverlight City were super easy to navigate, laid out in a neat grid with four main avenues shooting out from this massive sculpture smack in the middle of town.

That sculpture? It was built by Alexander Mitchell, the founding emperor of the Phoenix Dynasty, like, over seven hundred years ago. 

History books paint him as this big-time conqueror who fought a ton of battles and built the biggest empire of his era. Some folks think he's a legend, but others call him out for offing his own brothers to snag the throne.

Alexander's statue is right in the heart of Silverlight City and it's a major attraction.

At night, lights from all over shine on him, making his figure glow like some kind of divine guardian watching over the city.

The traffic light was taking forever, and Joseph, who hadn't been around in a while, sat in his car waiting, puffing on a cigarette and eyeing the grand sculpture. 

He rubbed his chin and muttered, "Are you even human? You killed your own brothers who went through hell with you. What else can't you do? History might be rewritten, but do you ever feel guilty?"

The light finally turned green, and Joseph hit the gas, heading east.

The priciest houses in Silverlight City were out west, in the new commercial area with all the fancy infrastructure and tons of companies. With commercial land competing, residential prices naturally shot up.

But the real rich folks in Silverlight City lived in the southeast, in the Three Rivers District. It was low-density, super green, and had a beautiful natural environment with villas scattered around.

Joseph seemed to know the area well, timing the traffic lights perfectly and not stopping at a single red. Soon, he parked his car in the garage of a villa.

The villa wasn't his; no way a working-class guy could afford it in two lifetimes. It belonged to someone else-Frank.

Joseph glanced at the dim light on the second floor, a complex expression crossing his face. He walked up the steps, pressed the fingerprint lock, and the door clicked open.

He turned on the foyer light, walked through, and headed to the bar in the spacious living room. He opened the fridge, grabbed a bottle of water, took a few gulps, caught his breath, and lit another cigarette.

He didn't bother with the living room chandelier. Some say dim lighting helps with concentration or deep thinking, but those weren't his reasons. He didn't need to think about anything. The swirling smoke making his vision blurrier was better; he just didn't want to see that person too clearly.

"I've told you a million times, no smoking in my house," Frank said, slowly coming down the spiral staircase, coughing a few times. "If you die from too much nicotine, that'd be a good thing. At least you wouldn't have to change your blood every six months and take all those weird chemicals, living like a ghost. Why bother?"

In the smoky, dim light, Joseph could only make out a hunched figure, which was enough for him.

Frank wasn't mad; he was used to Joseph's way of talking. But those few steps down the stairs left him sweating. 

Leaning on the stair railing, he quietly watched Joseph not far away, staring at the flickering cigarette butt and suddenly said, "If I die, can my organs be donated?"

"No," Joseph shook his head.

"Why not?" Frank looked surprised, then chuckled, "I think they still have some research value. Maybe you could study them. If I remember right, you were a whiz at anatomy in college. The professor said you were a rare genius. Shouldn't be too hard for you."

"Because it's a waste," Joseph grinned, snuffing out his cigarette and tossing it on the ground. 

He walked over, supporting Frank's arm, carefully helping him lie on the sofa. "You're half-dead, yet you still come downstairs to greet me. No need to be so stubborn."

"These years have been tough on you. Out of our group, only you dare to talk to me and Alan like this. The others, they care, but there's still some reverence. It's like being the eldest brother, it's normal to have some." Frank lay on the sofa, casually pulling a blanket over himself, smiling with a tone full of nostalgia, seemingly longing for the past.

Joseph said, "They only have reverence for you, not Alan. They only have endless admiration and gratitude for him."

"So, you're saying I'm not as good as him?" A flash of displeasure crossed Frank's face.

Joseph didn't respond, looking at the large LCD TV on the living room wall, and softly said, "Stop it. You're so rich. Before Nancy finds out, leave. Go abroad and enjoy the last part of your life, forget the hatred, and live happily for once."

Frank's tone rose a few notches, stiffly turning his neck, coldly staring at Joseph, "Do you think sticking on a fake beard can fool yourself? Do you really think I'm blind and didn't see it?"

Joseph's face turned pale sharply, glaring at Frank like a castrated wild dog, baring his teeth but not daring to move forward. Even a dying tiger was still a tiger.

Joseph asked, "Where are Tony and Lally? What did you say to Tom to make him ignore his own brother?"

"Don't look at me like that. It's been this way since we were kids." Frank shook his head, calmly saying, "I didn't say anything to Tom. It was his own choice. You don't understand his feelings for the Thompson family."

Joseph stood up abruptly, pointing at Frank and shouting. "What about Lally and Tony? Ask yourself honestly, if Alan hadn't taken you to the Thompson family's meals every now and then, would you be alive now?"

"Sit down! Do you still see me as your elder?" Frank shouted angrily, coughing repeatedly. 

After a while, he said, "Mrs. Thompson is in the hospital, receiving the best treatment. I found the doctor! I added $200,000 to the insurance policy Tony and Tom gave Mrs. Thompson. As for Tony, he overestimated himself, trying to save Lally and that bitch. His life is ruined by women!"

"I only ask you, will you save them or not?" Joseph asked sternly.

"To achieve great things, sacrifices must be made," Frank said calmly.

Joseph sneered several times, got up, and walked away.

Frank didn't stop him, just watched Joseph's back, calculating something in his mind. When Joseph reached the foyer, he called out to him, "Did you tip off Nancy?"

"No." Joseph stopped, not turning back.

"Alright, I overthought it." Frank nodded thoughtfully, "Then did you give Nancy Mrs. Thompson's insurance policy?"

"I'll say it again, I haven't seen Nancy." Joseph sighed, softly saying, "You sent me to court back then just to use me as a pawn, didn't you?"

"That's good." Frank slowly closed his eyes, whispering to himself, "Yes, someone has to be sacrificed."

###chapter 82 Joseph is Under Investigation

Yesterday, I went back home to visit my dad and stayed the night.

The idea that Alan might still be alive was just a hunch for now; the key was to see what evidence Joseph had.

Looking back, it definitely wasn't a coincidence that I ran into Joseph after leaving the police station. He wasn't just there to drop a few hints.

He was both a decoy, making me think Alan went to True Love Entertainment Club alone, and a guide, pushing me to dig deeper, making me question Alan's motives. 

This way, I stayed somewhat rational during the trial instead of being consumed by grief over losing my husband.

Joseph's actions seemed a bit scattered, but if we considered him as one of the victimized kids from back then, it started to make sense.

He might be like Tony and Lally, wanting to tell me something. Actually, it seemed like he wanted to tell me something from the start but held back for some reason.

Looking at it this way, it seemed like he was on Frank's side.

But then again, everyone involved in the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case had been transferred, except for him. Could he have been overlooked by the leadership?

No way. The forensic doctor was the most direct evidence person. If he stayed, there had to be a reason. The most likely reason was that he had a direct connection with the people protecting the main culprits of the child trafficking ring.

Moreover, he might be deeply connected to this case itself.

But these details weren't important right now. Since he hadn't left Silverlight City, it meant he was confident, and I didn't need to rush to find him.

The most important thing right now was that my dad called again the night before last, saying I hadn't been home in a while and asked if I had a fight with Alan and was too embarrassed to see him.

I went along with it and said we had a fight over some small stuff, and Alan went on a business trip and hadn't come back yet. The next morning, I quickly bought some things, drove home, and spent the day with my dad.

My dad asked why Alan wasn't answering his phone, which really startled me. 

It's been almost two months since the incident. Although Alan and my dad didn't usually talk much, the truth couldn't be hidden forever. If my dad noticed something, it would be impossible to hide it from him.

I quickly said that this business trip was a fully enclosed core training, and information couldn't be disclosed. I couldn't contact him either, let alone him.

My dad finally broke into a smile, adding more food to my plate. "My son-in-law is naturally successful, unlike some people who give up a good job at the prosecutor's office to become an editor-in-chief at a newspaper. Is that job stable? If the company goes under, they'll be unemployed again."

At that moment, I couldn't afford to discuss career choices with my dad, so I just nodded repeatedly in agreement.

This morning, I got up early, made breakfast for my dad, washed all the clothes at home, and cleaned the house. 

Just then, Zoey called. I found an excuse, saying there was something at the company, didn't even have lunch, and hurriedly left home, driving back to the city.

Zoey called to check on me, saying there was a lot going on at the company lately, and Howard had dumped a bunch of tasks on her that she couldn't refuse, making her work overtime every night. It was clear he was trying to keep her from getting involved in the case.

It seemed like Howard was also trying to keep Zoey from getting too involved. Even though he wasn't her dad, their bond was pretty much like father and daughter. I got it, and honestly, I didn't want Zoey mixed up in this mess either-it was way too dangerous.

But I couldn't just come out and say that, so I gently reassured her, filling her in on the latest. I told her we found the child trafficking camp at the old steel factory, which is now the True Love Entertainment Club.

Oddly, Zoey didn't seem too thrilled. She gave a weird response, then said she had plans to have dinner with her dad and would catch up with me later.

Zoey didn't spend much time with her dad growing up; Howard mostly raised her. It was good they were working on their relationship now, so I gave her some advice before hanging up. She cheerfully agreed and then we ended the call.

I checked the time-it was 9:30 in the morning.

By now, the court was already in session. I thought for a moment, found Joseph's name in my contacts, which I got from his file the night before last.

What should I say when I call? Would he spill the truth?

If he, like Tony and Lally, had second thoughts about revenge, then maybe calling him was worth a shot.

But what if he didn't? What if what he said the night Alan had the accident was just to cover for the two people who went to the Entertainment Club with Alan?

I hesitated.

Just then, my phone rang. It was Leonard. "Nancy, are you back from your dad's place?"

I replied, "Yeah, I just got back. I'm on the road now, planning to head to the court."

Leonard knew about my visit to my dad. He also said that since we had a lead, there was no rush to find Joseph. We needed to be patient and make sure my dad didn't get suspicious.

"Don't go there, you won't be able to meet him," Leonard said.

I was confused. "Why?"

"Joseph's been taken in for investigation. They say it's for lifestyle issues. He probably won't be out today," Leonard's voice sounded a bit off.

"Lifestyle issues?" I repeated, thinking of Joseph as a pretty straightforward guy. Even when we met that night, despite him putting on some weight in middle age, he didn't seem like someone with lifestyle issues. 

Plus, he was just a forensic doctor, not some big shot. Why would they target him?

Leonard was vague, not giving specifics, just telling me to ask the folks at Silverlight City Legal Journal. And Howard probably knew about it already.

I was puzzled and dialed Howard's number. "Howard, are you busy?"

"I'm listening to some juicy gossip! The court's got some real characters. I didn't expect this, someone so young already making waves," Howard said eagerly.

I was speechless for a moment. Leonard was right-my boss might be mediocre in the news business, but when it came to gossip in Silverlight City, he was always in the know.

I asked, "Joseph?"

Howard replied, "Nancy, you into gossip now? No, you don't seem the type. What's up, how do you know about Joseph?"

Howard got serious, "Could he be connected to that case too?"

I said, "Tell me about the lifestyle issue first."

"Oh, that," Howard teased, "First time in Silverlight City, a male forensic doctor having a sexual relationship with a certain leader. The video got posted online, and it was wild!"

"Focus," I reminded.

"That leader is also a man," Howard replied.

###chapter 83 Plum Blossoms and Frost

In the wealthy villa at Starlight Rivers District, on the second-floor study.

The twilight outside was fading fast, and Frank, sitting in his wheelchair, watched quietly.

He suddenly wondered where the last bit of light between day and night goes.

In a blink, it was dark.

His face turned somber, eyes dropping, feeling like time and life were slipping out of his hands.

The room got darker, but he didn't bother turning on the light, letting the night take over. His lonely silhouette looked kinda helpless.

He got a call, listened quietly, his dry lips parting slightly, and his voice was soft. "People change. If it wasn't for his heads-up, Nancy wouldn't have known. I regret that. Let's give it one last shot. Before the new world comes, I'll bow out, no applause, no cheers."

The call ended, and the room was dead silent again.

Frank slowly wheeled himself to the desk, where the projector flickered on.

A beam of light hit the wall, the only light in the room.

Frank stared at it for a long time, turned it off, then back on. The light flickered, but the last bit of afternoon sun was gone.

He turned to the wall, where a video of Laura in the university drama club was playing.

Laura, in a fiery red dress with a long train, stepped onto the stage.

It looked like a pool of blood flowing up the steps, so striking.

Even with heavy makeup, she wasn't tacky. She was stunning, like nothing could outshine her.

This was the opera "Plum Blossoms and Frost" that Alan, Frank, and Laura wrote back in college.

"You ask me, why do I bloom in winter? Is it the poet's lament for spring and autumn, or the gentleman's sense of integrity? No, who understands me? I am the devil of flowers, the undertaker. Their bodies turn into nutrients nourishing my roots. Crawling out from the pile of corpses, the king of winter is born. At that moment, I am the most beautiful flower in the world." 

Laura raised her arm and shouted.

Then the music started, and Frank, dressed in white, appeared, his clothes thin and his figure frail. 

"You ask me, why do I arrive in autumn and winter? I am the martyr, the gravekeeper, the scavenger. Before the new world arrives, I dance with time, assassinating all evils overnight. Thank fate, I met the king. This is my destiny. I will be the blood-red contrast. Because of me, red is so enchanting. This is the king's tenderness."

In the video, Laura stood high above, looking down on everyone, while Frank, dressed in white, bowed and slowly approached from the steps below, finally kneeling at Laura's feet.

Laura crouched down and embraced Frank.

Frank stared at the video of Laura, his eyes burning, murmuring non-stop.

He reached out, as if wanting to touch the face of the past again. Halfway, he pulled his hand back and gently touched his own neck, slowly moving to other places where they had once kissed and caressed.

His eyes were misty, his body started to sweat a bit, his breathing got faster, and his right arm kept trembling.

The guy in the wheelchair suddenly jerked, his straight posture slumping, and then he went still.

Night had fallen.

The projector was off, and the room was dead quiet. If you didn't look closely, you wouldn't even notice the man slumped in the wheelchair.

If he died like this, it might be ages before anyone found his decaying body.

But this guy was different. His chest rose and fell weakly, making faint breathing sounds. He seemed to be asleep.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes, like a demon crawling out of a broken coffin in a mass grave.

He cried and laughed intermittently, but whether crying or laughing, he let out hysterical screams, like a madman.

No, even madmen spoke. He just kept screaming and shouting.

After a while, he started cursing loudly, spitting, and thrashing around like a hungry wolf with a lame leg.

This was a standalone villa, with low building density, but the sound still spread out. The people around didn't say anything, thinking there was a lunatic living here.

But there was one thing everyone heard clearly, a person's name, indicating a deep grudge. That was Laura.

Howard laughed at me, saying that after Joseph got into trouble, the most anxious person turned out to be me, someone unrelated to him.

In a café near the company, Howard was chattering about the news he had gathered. 

"Which specific leader, I'm not sure. How would I know such things? But there are only so many people in the state court, police, prosecutor's office, and court. Just eliminate them one by one."

"How do I know? Watch the video. There are many photos circulating too, though you probably can't find them now. Don't look at me like that. I'm not gay. As a media worker... the boss of a media company, I need to be informed about the news happening in Silverlight City. It's my responsibility and duty."

Howard, who usually appeared righteous and gentlemanly during media interviews, looking like a business elite, would light up with excitement whenever gossip was mentioned, even if he hadn't slept all night. 

It was a pity he worked in legal journalism; he should have gone into gossip media. He might have become the top entertainment reporter in the industry.

I had no time for his news commentary and went straight to the point.

Indeed, during university, I had contact with Joseph because of Alan, but we weren't close, just acquaintances.

We hadn't been in touch for years. Rather than knowing him, it was more about the impression he left.

A boy as pretty as a girl, clean, a bit shy, speaking softly. If you didn't listen carefully, you wouldn't know what he was saying. But he sang beautifully. He was the new lead in the drama club's opera performance. With his long hair, many guys mistook him for a pretty girl.

Girls liked him too, and he had many admirers. Joseph would blush whenever he talked about it, but later I heard he had a girlfriend.

When he graduated, Alan and I were already married. After graduation, everyone got busy and lost touch.

I saw him again just over a month ago, in his thirties, slightly overweight, with a beard, and a smoking habit, looking like a middle-aged man.

How did he suddenly get involved in an unspeakable relationship with another man?

###chapter 84 There is a Role Called Father

"Is Joseph married?" I asked.

"Yeah, he is," Howard replied.

Howard took a sip of his coffee and started, "His wife is Evelyn Nguyen. She works in the Forestry Resources Department at the Silverlight City Forestry Bureau. She studied landscape design at Silverlight University." 

"She's pretty average-looking and has a low-key social life. Mostly stays home watching TV shows and movies. She started dating Joseph in college; she's three years younger and was reportedly his first love. This guy's got it good..." 

"Let me think, Evelyn's family is from the neighboring Border Ridge City. Her parents are both teachers, and they have a decent family background. She also has an older brother, and her sister-in-law is quite a piece of work. Apparently, her sister-in-law often gives her a hard time. I think Evelyn's a bit too soft."

"Why don't you ditch the Silverlight City Legal Journal and start a gossip magazine instead? You're wasting your talent here," I teased.

I was convinced that Howard not running a gossip magazine was a huge loss to the entertainment media industry. In less than a day, he had dug up everything about Joseph's family, including his wife's name, college major, and even Evelyn's family drama. He even knew about the issues with Evelyn's sister-in-law.

This was a skill not everyone had.

Howard shook his head, looking at me like I was the one missing the point. "You're too serious, not like a young person. I'm not doing this just for fun, at least not entirely. Actually, I'm trying to figure out if Joseph is gay and if he's had some major trauma from women that made him switch teams."

"So, what's your conclusion?" I asked.

"No conclusion. There's too much random info, and it's too exhausting," Howard said confidently.

"It's a good thing Zoey isn't like you, or she'd be led astray." I couldn't help but tease. 

It's not an exaggeration to say that Zoey was raised by Howard. Luckily, Zoey didn't turn out like him, or the legal news journal would have turned into a gossip rag.

"Do you have some misunderstanding about Zoey?" Howard was stunned for a moment and then smiled awkwardly. "Actually, it was Zoey who told me the news."

Wait, how did Zoey know I was investigating Joseph?

I had just mentioned it to Howard, without going into detail. Only Leonard and I should know that Joseph was connected to this case.

How did Zoey find out?

"Joseph is connected to the True Love Entertainment Club murder case. You know how dangerous this case is. Lally wanted to tell me the truth and disappeared. Tony wanted to tell me the truth and also disappeared. Zoey can't get too involved in this." I stared at Howard seriously.

Howard, who had been joking around, suddenly got serious. He seemed to realize something and took out his phone, angrily shouting, "You bastard, you have a daughter and make me raise her, and now you're causing trouble for your own daughter. There's no father like you in the world. I'll burn your office today!"

Howard was clearly pissed, cursing and slamming the table. Judging by the sound of it, he was calling Zoey's father, Ronald.

Why would the head of the state criminal investigation team be looking into this? Could Zoey's father be involved too?

Howard was still fuming, and it wasn't the best time to ask him anything. Plus, his voice was so loud that people around us were starting to notice and turn to look.

"Everyone, get back to what you were doing!" Howard stood up and shouted at the onlookers with an authoritative tone. They quickly shrank back and resumed staring at their phones.

I've heard that the more capable a person is, the worse their temper, and Howard was proving that true.

I've known Howard for a long time, even before I graduated. I thought I knew him well. He had a great personality and never got angry, even when he lost money or got cheated. But when it came to Zoey, this was the first time I'd seen him so furious.

"Calm down, Zoey is still fine in the office," I said.

Howard took a deep breath, hung up the phone, and slowly sat back down.

Rationality was a basic quality that businessmen should have. Making key decisions and understanding market trends required a calm and almost cold-blooded judgment.

But being a businessman was just one of his roles. He also had another role, a somewhat unclear father figure.

"Find a way to keep Zoey busy during this time. Give her more work so she doesn't go out. I have a feeling this case will be resolved soon," I tried to comfort him.

Howard thought for a moment and said, "So, what exactly is Joseph's connection to this case?" 

He frowned and suddenly said, "I remember you said that Alan went to the Entertainment Club alone because Joseph told him to. If Joseph is the only one related to the case who hasn't been transferred and now this comes out, the most likely scenario is..."

"Alright, Howard, don't overthink it," I interrupted his speculation and said seriously, "You can't get involved in this anymore. I can handle it alone. You and Zoey can't lose each other. I can't drag everyone down because of my issues. And keeping Zoey out of this is the biggest help. I'm her mentor, and I see her as a sister. She can't be put in any danger."

"Joseph's wife is standing at the courthouse entrance. She hasn't eaten or drunk anything for almost a day. She won't talk to anyone. You might want to check it out." Howard isn't one to be verbose; he gave the information straightforwardly.

At the courthouse entrance.

This was the first time in my life that I had seen such a stubborn woman.

Court staff were holding bottled water and bread, constantly trying to persuade her.

"Please go home and wait for news. It's uncertain."

"Joseph works diligently at our company. If this is all unfounded, don't worry, his personal reputation won't be affected. Our leaders have also said that if everything is fine, his promotion at the end of the year will be handled fairly."

"Please go home, or come inside and sit down. You've been standing all day. There's nothing that can't be explained."

Onlookers also chimed in, "Exactly, there's nothing that can't be explained. Trust in justice and fairness. Don't make things hard for yourself. Miss, please go home."

Evelyn didn't respond, her eyes fixed on the emblem symbolizing fairness and justice. Her legs didn't move an inch. 

It wasn't that she had great stamina; her legs were numb, and she was standing purely on willpower.

She wasn't very tall, wearing a black trench coat with her hands in the pockets, standing at the courthouse entrance with many onlookers around.

"Are you bullying ordinary people because you can't bully the big shots?" Evelyn said coldly.

###chapter 85 I Will Stay with You Until the End

The moment Evelyn spoke, her lips split open, and blood started dripping, covering her entire mouth.

It was an overcast day, the sky all gray and gloomy, making the winter day feel even more bleak and desolate. Everything around had this gray-black vibe, adding to the solemn mood.

Her bright red lips stood out like a splash of blood in a black-and-white photo, cold and tragic.

"I want to ask you, what does 'lifestyle issues' even mean?" Evelyn shot a cold glance at the people in the court. "Isn't it just persecution? Why don't you go after the big shots instead of hassling regular folks?"

One of the court staff sternly replied, "Ma'am, please be responsible for your words and actions. If an official commits a crime, we won't cover it up or insult the law. Joseph is still under investigation and isn't here. We really don't know the situation."

There were so many people outside, and Evelyn was speaking freely. Bystanders were snapping photos and videos, which could end up online, causing a public opinion storm and hurting the government's credibility. It was no small matter.

"Don't you want to know who reported this?" Evelyn stared at the staff member. "Doesn't your dean know about this? Pretending to be deaf and mute usually, but now, after getting some news, hurriedly reporting it for credit. Is it because that big shot was dismissed, and he can take the position?"

The court staff warned, "Miss! Watch your words, or we'll call the police!"

"Go ahead, I'll say the same thing in front of the police." Evelyn said calmly. "The guard won't let me in, so I'll wait for your dean to come out. As long as Joseph isn't released, I'll stand here. While he's being interrogated, how can I sit at home peacefully? I'll stick with him to the end."

The crowd around was growing, and the staff member had already taken out his phone to call the police. If not stopped, the situation would escalate, and it would be hard to resolve. Evelyn might even end up at the police station.

What was the point of that?

I pushed through the crowd and stepped forward. "Evelyn."

Evelyn turned to look at me, a hint of confusion in her eyes, "Police?"

I replied, "Nancy."

Her stiff body suddenly trembled, her legs gave way, and she was about to fall. I quickly stepped forward to support her.

Evelyn looked at me, tears streaming down her face, her lips trembling slightly, "Nancy, I... I... I have something to tell you."

"Not here, too many people." I glanced at the crowd. The court staff were surprised by my appearance, not expecting Evelyn to lower her guard after seeing me.

The court staff asked, "Hello, may I ask who you are?"

"Nancy Johnson, editor-in-chief of the Silverlight City Legal Journal. Our editorial team is very interested in this incident and wants to interview this lady. I must remind you that the crowd is still filming, and my recorder is on. I believe you can quickly come up with a solution." I smiled and showed my press card. "If the situation gets out of control, maybe I should be the one calling the police."

Sure enough, upon hearing my name, their attitude changed immediately. They came forward to greet me, "Oh, Ms. Johnson, you should have said earlier. We were worried for nothing."

Even though the Silverlight City Legal Journal wasn't an official publication, it had a solid reputation in Silverlight City and the whole state. We had worked with both city and state courts, even providing media training for the court's publicity department. So, my name was pretty well-known around here.

"That makes things easier. I'll take her with me and solve your problem," I said.

The staff member looked a bit doubtful and cautiously asked, "Do you know her?"

"No," I replied.

"Then why did she suddenly..." the court staff started.

"Try standing outside in the winter for a day," I snorted, giving him a look. "If it wasn't for sheer willpower, she would've collapsed long ago. I'll take her to the hospital first. If you stop me, I won't hesitate to become her lawyer and file a lawsuit. If legal professionals lack compassion, what's the point of studying law? Seems like you guys need more training."

"No, your help is greatly appreciated," the court staff said.

They quickly stepped aside. My car was parked by the roadside, and I helped Evelyn into the car and drove away.

Evelyn didn't want to go to the hospital. She said she was in good health and it wasn't a big deal. So, we found a restaurant and asked the waiter for a private room. Although it was unusual for two people to get a private room, it was around 3 PM, not a busy time, so they agreed.

I ordered some hot dishes and soup for Evelyn to warm up and get her energy back.

After eating, Evelyn seemed better, so I asked, "How much do you know about Joseph's situation?"

Evelyn's expression darkened. She bit her lip, hesitating for a long time, her eyes red, and said softly, "I only know he has a connection with some big shot, but I don't know who."

"You said earlier that Joseph was persecuted by that big shot?" I paused, unsure how to ask. Evelyn had said they weren't in that kind of relationship, and it was persecution.

"He's normal, it's that person who's not. But he won't say anything, just because he doesn't want to lose his job, so..." 

Evelyn nodded, then started crying. "I know he has many secrets. In his dreams, he often talks in his sleep, calling out names. He doesn't want to say, and I don't force him. For a man, it's already painful enough. I can't add to his pain. But... it's so painful. Our life feels dismembered, cruelly shattered. I can't do anything."

Life feeling dismembered, how much hardship must one endure to use such a metaphor?

"Alan, Frank, Laura, Bob, Mike, Lally, Duke, Tom..." I listed the names in one breath, then said sadly, "Are these the names?"

Evelyn nodded. My guess was right; Joseph was one of the children from that concentration camp.

Evelyn said, "They..."

"Nothing, just some friends. How did you know about me?" I changed the subject. 

Since Joseph hadn't told her, I wouldn't bring it up. Why burden his wife with such a tragic past? Life was already hard enough, with past demons still haunting them.

Evelyn replied, "Before Joseph was taken away, he called me. Maybe he sensed something and told me to remember your name. If you didn't come to find me, it meant nothing happened. If you did, I was to give you two messages."

###chapter 86 It's Not Him

"What did he say?" My heart was racing. 

If anyone knew if Alan was really dead, it would be the coroner. The body was so badly burned that DNA testing was tough. 

I was a mess at the time. A DNA test that complicated would need multiple comparisons, and without Alan's DNA, how could they figure it out overnight just from a ring?

Evelyn said, "First thing he said: It's not him. Second thing: Ronald Food Truck."

I kept repeating "It's not him" in my head. My cheeks were hot, and tears were already streaming down my face.

It wasn't him. That body wasn't Alan. He was still alive!

"Where is he?" I stammered, looking at Evelyn through my tears. "Where is he? Please, tell me where he is..."

Evelyn looked scared and confused. She shook her head and started crying too. "I don't know. Joseph only told me those two things before they took him away. Ms. Johnson, who are you? Please save Joseph. He's innocent... He couldn't have any lifestyle issues."

Evelyn's sobs got louder. "I just can't believe it. His life has been hard enough."

I said, "I'm Alan's wife. Don't worry, I'll find a way to get him out. I have so many questions for him. Don't cry. As long as he's alive, there's hope. Life is long, and things will get better."

I wiped my tears and walked over to gently pat Evelyn, who was crying uncontrollably on the table. "I'm Joseph's senior. I promise you, I'll bring him back safe and sound."

Then I turned and left the restaurant.

The second thing Joseph told me was Ronald Food Truck.

I remembered. The first time I went to True Love Entertainment Club to investigate, around 1 PM, a guy set up a stall called "Ronald Food Truck."

Ronald... Why did that name sound so familiar?

Zoey's dad! If that was true, I remembered the second time I went to True Love Entertainment Club, Benjamin stared at the food truck owner for a long time. 

The manager even asked if the guy was a criminal. Benjamin said he looked like someone from his village and that they should take good care of his business.

He definitely recognized him. Benjamin was from Silverlight City; there was no way he had a village buddy here.

Plus, when we were waiting downstairs that day, Zoey's expression was off. She must have recognized her dad then.

I found it weird that day too, but after going upstairs and seeing the injured Lally, and then diving into Alan's case, I forgot about it.

So that was it. No wonder Zoey knew about this case. Her dad Ronald must have spilled the beans.

Wait, Howard was furious today, slamming the table, and the scene was chaotic. Then he told me about Evelyn and forgot to ask about this.

Digging into this case was risky, but Zoey was still fine in the office. Howard could just call to remind her; there shouldn't be such a big emotional reaction.

Howard said he helped me because of the shared pain of losing a spouse, our years of friendship, and my contributions to the company. But now it seemed it wasn't that simple.

His reaction was way too intense. There was only one reason: he knew Ronald was digging into True Love Entertainment Club. He might even know the dangers lurking there and what went down in the past!

Why didn't he tell me?

I glanced at the time. It was 4 PM. Ronald might still be at that stall!

On the way, I called Howard directly and asked, "Howard, are you hiding something from me?"

"No, what would I hide from you? Last time, I asked you to register as a company partner and put the documents in front of you, but you didn't want to sign." He replied decisively.

From Howard's tone, it didn't sound like he was lying, but I kept pushing, "Is Ronald investigating True Love Entertainment Club? Why didn't you tell me?"

There was silence on the other end of the line. After a while, he replied, "Joseph is also one of the kids from the old steel mill, right?"

"You know about the old steel mill, you really have been hiding something from me." I said.

I hadn't told Howard about this, and why did he use the word "also"?

"Neither of us should complain. You never mentioned Alan's past either. Every time you came to me, it was to ask about people. I'm not a fool; I naturally investigated. I know some of the names of the kids from the old steel mill, so I could guess Alan's past." Howard said.

"I was because..." I hesitated. Alan's past was too tragic. I really didn't want to bring it up in front of others. 

Moreover, this case was inherently dangerous. I was very worried that they would get too involved and bring disaster upon themselves.

"I understand." Howard sighed on the phone. "Entangled grievances, a troubled fate, who would want to bring it up? You wouldn't even want to dream about it."

"How much do you know? Tell me." I got straight to the point.

"Not much. Ronald is very tight-lipped. I only know about the old steel mill and some of the names." Howard replied.

"Including Frank?" I asked.

"Yes, he didn't tell me, but I know. That's one of the reasons we get along well. This person has a very strong will." 

Howard said frankly, then hesitated and asked, "Nancy, there's something you might get very angry about, but..."

"But you're going to say it anyway, right? At this point... if you think it's unnecessary to say, then don't." I could vaguely guess what he was going to say, so I interrupted him.

"Stop investigating. I know it's cruel, but listen to me. Ronald was demoted to an ordinary police officer years ago because of his investigation into the old steel mill case. This man is very stubborn. He said he had been pursuing this case for over twenty years and couldn't just stop. And the result?" Howard sighed.

"I do admire him." I said.

For a law enforcement officer, the pursuit of justice and truth was a lifelong mission. Zoey's father was a good cop.

"He was shot three times, each time nearly losing his life. If I hadn't found a military doctor, this bastard would be dead. It doesn't matter if he dies, but what about Zoey? Nancy, Alan is gone. I know you're in pain, but... even if you wait a little longer, being alive is more important than anything." Howard said.

"Alan is still alive. I have to find him. This case must be solved." I replied.

Then I hung up the phone.

###chapter 87 The Old Steel Mill's Past

If someone's dreary life suddenly got a spark of hope, all difficulties would seem pointless.

It wasn't rush hour, so the road was way less crowded than usual.

Howard shot me a text: [Bring Alan at the end of the year, let's have a reunion dinner, and Zoey too. Live well, or I'll dock your pay. Don't hide anything from me. I'm pretty well-known in Silverlight City, helping out won't kill me. Reply to my message, I'm being so sincere here.]

I chuckled and sent a voice message back, "You talk too much."

I hit the gas and headed straight to the True Love Entertainment Club.

When I was almost there, it was around 4:30 PM. I turned left off the main road and spotted the "Ronald Food Truck" still parked there. 

Ronald, with his greasy hair, was sitting on a chair, puffing on a cigarette.

He noticed a car coming, glanced my way, and slowly got up.

Seeing it was me, he grinned, "Remember me? What brings you here today? Want another meal? It's on me. I felt bad about that pack of cigarettes last time."

I nodded, "I'll take the same burger as last time, but I'm still paying. If it weren't for you, I might've ended up working at this Entertainment Club, and that would've been a nightmare."

"You must be kidding. You seem smart. Even if I hadn't said anything, you'd have figured it out." With that, Ronald started making the burger with practiced ease.

In no time, the burger was ready.

I had already eaten earlier, but since it was made by Zoey's dad Ronald, and judging by his expression, he probably didn't know I had figured out who he was. Plus, it smelled amazing and was packed with meat.

"Eat up, it's on me." Ronald was confident in his cooking. He lit another cigarette and kept smoking happily.

I couldn't resist taking a few more bites; the seasoning was spot on.

Maybe it was because I had confirmed Alan was still alive, my mood was way better, and so was my appetite. While munching, I said, "Sir, you really have a knack for this. It tastes fantastic!"

"When you're in a good mood, your appetite naturally improves. If it's not enough, I can whip up another one." Ronald grinned and chuckled.

"How do you know if I'm in a good mood or not?" I asked.

"It's obvious. People, whether happy or not, can't fake it. When they're truly happy, their eyes sparkle. When they're not, every move they make shows their sadness." Ronald kept smoking and said, "That's my experience from years of running this food stand."

I thought about how Howard often took Zoey to eat when she was little and said, "If your kid has eaten your burgers, they must be really happy, just like you said, their eyes would be full of smiles."

Ronald was taken aback for a moment, then smiled awkwardly and nodded, changing the subject. 

He leaned in mysteriously and asked, "Miss, can I ask you something? Last time I saw you with the police here, something must have happened. There was even an ambulance. Did someone die?"

"No, but Lally got hurt. My apprentice and I took her to the hospital that day," I replied.

"Was it serious?" Ronald asked, sounding concerned.

"Not too bad, she woke up pretty soon. But now she's missing, and we can't find her. Do you know her, sir?" I looked at him with a half-smile. 

Ronald turned around, wiped his sweat with the towel on his shoulder, and started cleaning the cooking utensils he had just used.

I finished the burger quickly; my appetite was unusually good today.

"Want another one?" Ronald asked.

"No, actually, I already ate earlier. But I wanted to see you. Last time we parted in a hurry, and I felt there were many things left unsaid." I wiped my mouth and sat on the small stool, smiling.

Ronald quickly cleaned the cooking area and finally responded, "What do you want to say?"

"I was just thinking, if Zoey ate your food, she would be very happy, right?" I said.

Ronald paused, glanced at me, and his eyes changed completely. That sharp, eagle-like gaze flashed by. This was the demeanor honed by years as a professional detective. 

Zoey was the person he cared about the most. Earlier, he didn't use his real identity to talk to me, naturally appearing as a simple food stand owner. 

But now, when I mentioned Zoey's name and revealed his identity, that natural paternal vigilance immediately surged up, instinctively alert.

The look in his eyes disappeared in an instant because he had seen Zoey and me together last time.

He continued working without saying a word.

"When did you find out Joseph had a problem? Was it the True Love Entertainment Club murder case or the child trafficking case at the old steel factory in Sand Village over twenty years ago?" I asked.

"Who are you?" Ronald looked up, scanning me up and down. 

Although he looked greasy and unkempt, his demeanor had completely changed. That upright aura was overwhelming, and his voice was no longer lazy but naturally firm.

"Didn't Howard tell you? I thought he mentioned it. Nancy, editor-in-chief of the Silverlight City Legal Journal." I stood up and handed him the plate, "I really like Zoey. She's my apprentice, and I treat her like a sister."

"Not that. I guessed your relationship when you and Benjamin came that day." 

Ronald shook his head, then suddenly thought of something and smiled, "Benjamin, that guy, has grown a lot over the years. If it were before, he would have come over to chat right away. Too obvious. That's why he's not suited to be an undercover cop. He can charge into battle and investigate clues, but with that brain, he'd be dead on the second day as an undercover cop. His apprentice seems to be the same. Like master, like apprentice."

I chuckled, "You have a keen eye. Benjamin's mentor said the same thing."

"Because Benjamin's mentor, Albert Turner, is my friend. When Albert was selecting apprentices, I picked Benjamin for him." Ronald said with a smile, putting down his work, "Enough reminiscing. I'm grateful for your care of Zoey, but why are you interested in this case? Who are you?"

"My husband's name is Alan," I replied.

###chapter 88 Ronald

The lighter just wouldn't work. Ronald, with a cigarette dangling from his lips, glanced around and saw I wasn't a smoker. So, he just moved the pot off the gas stove.

He lit the gas stove, held the cigarette between his fingers, squinted, bent down, and leaned into the flame. The flame flickered, and his oily skin shone like polished wood, with the wrinkles on his face glistening.

As he got close to the flame, the tip of the cigarette turned red, and thick white smoke slowly drifted from his mouth.

Ronald was a chain smoker. In no time, he was already on his third cigarette.

Most detectives smoked, not just to look cool like in movies and TV shows, but because their schedules were all over the place. 

They'd go days without much sleep, sometimes sitting in a car watching a suspect all day. This kind of mentally exhausting work made them tired, and smoking was the best way to stay alert and reduce fatigue.

If you don't believe it, just visit a police station. Most of the ashtrays are Red Bull cans. They either smoked or drank Red Bull; coffee was too expensive. Plus, coffee's a diuretic, and for this kind of job, frequent bathroom breaks weren't ideal. You could miss a crucial clue during a bathroom break.

No one ordered them to do this; they did it willingly. The pay for detectives wasn't that great. In Silverlight City, it was just above average, but it didn't match the danger they faced.

Of course, no one thought about it that way because they were cops. Their badge gave them a sense of purpose.

When he leaned over to light his cigarette, I noticed a long scar on his neck, about 0.03 feet wide. Such a neat wound wasn't likely from a sharp weapon; it looked more like a bullet had grazed his neck. 

Suddenly, I remembered Howard once said Ronald had been assassinated several times, and it was Howard who saved him. The scar might have been from those times.

"Got it." Ronald nodded and said no more, squinting at the True Love Entertainment Club building. 

His eyes flickered like a seasoned hunter who had been staking out in the forest for several sleepless nights, waiting for the prey to appear and for the chance to strike a fatal blow.

He had been waiting for over twenty years.

"Who told you about my identity?" Ronald pondered for a moment and asked suspiciously, "Zoey, or... Howard?"

"Neither." I noticed Ronald paused when he mentioned Howard, as if he was a bit annoyed, and I smiled, "You two don't seem to get along."

Ronald was taken aback, then laughed heartily and candidly, "In the early years, Erica and I were busy with our own things. Thanks to Howard for taking care of Zoey all the time. Whether it's the friendship between him and me or his dedication to Zoey, it's not something that can be summed up with a simple thank you."

A hint of sadness flashed across his face, and he sighed, "Maybe it's guilt and jealousy. Guilt for not doing enough for Zoey as a father, and jealousy... Howard, in some ways, is more like Zoey's father. When Zoey and I talk on the phone, it's mostly about Howard. You know, I haven't seen Zoey in three years. We usually just talk on the phone."

I frowned. They were both in Silverlight City. No matter how busy they were, they should have met. Why hadn't they seen each other for three years?

Then it hit me. I could see why.

Howard said Ronald had pissed off a lot of big shots while working on this case, getting demoted from head of the state criminal investigation team to just a regular cop. 

He'd faced assassination attempts and was now flipping burgers near the True Love Entertainment Club. Such a fall from grace and constant danger might be something he didn't want Zoey to witness.

For a moment, I didn't know what to say. Maybe I could tell him that Zoey only cared about him as her dad, not his status. Or that Zoey always thought about him.

But a parent's protection and choices for their child are always selfless, especially in life-and-death situations. Ronald wouldn't tell Zoey the truth behind this, even if it meant letting her continue to misunderstand.

As a father, his greatest hope was for his daughter to live a healthy and happy life, and that was enough.

"However, Howard seemed a bit anxious when he called." Ronald thought for a moment, then smiled, "I know Zoey is helping you investigate the True Love Entertainment Club murder case. Howard mentioned it, and Zoey hinted at it too. But I didn't tell her about Joseph being a suspect. No matter how impartial and determined I am to catch the culprit, I am still Zoey's father, and I must be selfish."

"You mean, Zoey..." I was surprised. If it were true, Zoey's talent in this area was definitely inherited from Ronald.

"Yeah, she must have figured it out on her own." Ronald couldn't help but smile, proud that his daughter was like him. 

He continued, "Lately, she's been calling more often, asking about information on police, prosecutors, and court personnel. Howard said she was with you a while ago and now suddenly has free time. My first thought was that you and Howard must have restricted her from investigating the case."

I nodded. Ronald, with his years of experience as a detective, could deduce from Howard and Zoey's few words that we had restricted Zoey from investigating the case.

"Thank you," Ronald said solemnly. "Zoey really can't continue investigating. You know..."

"I understand. Go on," I said.

"Actually, I wish she were more like Erica, with a strong career drive, acting decisively, and having a stronger desire and ambition for money, status, and power than men." 

"But she turned out to be like me. All the suspects in the True Love Entertainment Club murder case were transferred, except for Joseph. This is a blind spot in thinking." 

"Without investigative experience, it's hard to think from the perspective of the suspects. It requires a spirit of questioning everything and strong investigative imagination. If she were a cop, she would be excellent at solving cases, and her achievements would surpass mine!"

The more Ronald spoke, the more excited he became, his expression passionate. 

Then he slumped, looking dejected, and said sadly, "But she is my daughter. I must consider her safety. There are too many excellent cops and outstanding detectives in the world. One more or one less doesn't make a difference."

###chapter 89 Who Is the Real Dead Person?

"Zoey's working at the Silverlight City Legal Journal now, so you don't need to stress. With Howard around, she'll be alright," I reassured him softly.

Ronald and Howard were college roommates. They should be around the same age, but Howard still looked like he was in his thirties or forties, while Ronald's skin was wrinkled like tree bark, and his hair was mostly white, making him look more like a weathered old man in his sixties.

Given all the near-death experiences he's had over the years, how could I scold him or lecture him about Zoey's career choices from a parental perspective?

I sighed and brought the conversation back to the main topic to keep Ronald from drowning in his guilt as a father. He had it tough enough already. 

"Joseph got taken away because of some lifestyle issues. Word is, he had a relationship with a male state official. Before he left, he called his wife and told her two things if I came looking for him." 

"First, Alan is not dead, and second, to find you. So, you're here in disguise, setting up a stall to investigate the criminals involved in the old steel mill's child trafficking case?"

Ronald looked at me in surprise and said, "That's right. How far have you gotten in your investigation?"

Since we were both digging into the same case, it made sense to share info. Plus, Ronald and Joseph had a unique bond. For Joseph to leave a message asking me to find Ronald before being taken away, there had to be a significant level of trust. 

I also had a hunch that since he knew Joseph, he probably knew Alan, Lally, Frank, Laura, and the rest too.

I was itching to find out what really went down back then.

So, I decided to spill all the info and suspicions I had gathered, detailing everything from meeting Joseph to investigating Sand Village, Tony, Lally, Duke, Frank, Tom, and so on.

It had been a rough journey, with everyone being half-truthful. When they were finally ready to spill the beans, they suddenly vanished. In the end, it seemed that Frank, whom I initially investigated, might be the mastermind behind it all. 

Many of my initial leads were wrong, like looking for the child trafficking base. If I hadn't gone to Cindy's house, I wouldn't have realized that the place of evil was the old steel mill's ruins. If Leonard hadn't found Joseph's suspicious points, I wouldn't have gone to find Joseph, and Evelyn wouldn't have come to me with Joseph's message.

"Those guys," Ronald's face darkened, and he muttered.

"Can you tell me about Alan and Joseph? It's important for my investigation," I asked sincerely, suddenly remembering something. "Were you here at your stall on the day of the True Love Entertainment Club incident? Did you see Alan? Who was he with?"

Ronald had been investigating this case, so he must have seen Alan when he went to the Entertainment Club that afternoon. Knowing who Alan was with and where he was now could provide valuable information!

"I was here that day and recognized him, but he didn't seem to recognize me after all these years. He was in a hurry, and two people were waiting for him downstairs. They had an argument as soon as they met," Ronald recalled, unconsciously smiling. "Those two crybabies have grown up and become much more scheming, just like that guy."

"Frank?" I asked.

"Yeah." Ronald rubbed his face and sat on a small stool. He was about to light a cigarette but stopped when he saw me next to him. "I wondered what they were doing here. This place is a nightmare for them, and they would avoid it if they could. The only reason they would come here is..."

"Revenge," Ronald and I said at the same time.

"Exactly. That's the only reason. I was going to go up and check, but the security guard stopped me." Ronald smiled bitterly and pointed to his dirty clothes. 

"Dressed like this, I didn't look like a customer but more like someone looking for trouble. So, I called Joseph and asked him to come quickly. Joseph said he was with a leader and couldn't get away, so I called Lally. I was worried they might do something extreme."

It seemed he was in contact with both Lally and Joseph. "I guess Lally didn't answer."

Ronald nodded slowly. "Yeah, at that moment, I knew something was wrong. Shortly after, Joseph told me the whole story. The victim was an official, but he received orders to match the DNA of the body to Alan's with a 99% match. A big shot was starting to take action, targeting Laura."

Wait! Ronald didn't mention Lally, Tammy, Tom, or the others, only that a big shot was targeting Laura.

If Frank was the mastermind, Joseph would have known the situation. Or was it possible that Joseph was also present that day and they all deceived Ronald?

"Is that all you know?" To ensure the completeness of the information, I decided to confirm.

"Yeah." Ronald nodded.

"I think Joseph lied to you," I said bluntly. It wasn't Ronald's fault. Although we were investigating the same place, our leads and timelines were different.

I started investigating from the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case, following the clues provided by Lally. 

After figuring out their backgrounds, I discovered they all came from the same place, which led me to the old steel mill's child trafficking case.

Ronald, on the other hand, started with the child trafficking case, aiming directly at the suspects behind it. Joseph and the others might have only provided him with leads and had nothing to do with the child trafficking case itself. On the contrary, they were victims.

"Why do you say that?" Ronald asked.

"The True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case went to trial on the third day after the incident. You know that, right?" I said.

"Yeah." Ronald replied.

"But do you know who testified against Laura?" Seeing Ronald's puzzled expression, I continued, "Tom's adoptive mother Tammy, Lally, and Tom himself."

Ronald's face changed dramatically. He stood up abruptly, almost losing his balance, and asked in shock, "What! They want to put Laura to death? How is that possible?"

"Let me think..." Ronald paced back and forth, muttering to himself. 

Suddenly, he shouted, "Joseph was also there. That guy lied to me! They must all have been there! The victim wasn't an official; it was the Entertainment Club's owner, Douglas Campbell!"

###chapter 90 Birth Control Pills

"But why would they testify falsely in court to get Laura killed?"Ronald asked. I shrugged; this was also one of the clues I needed to investigate.

Moreover, considering the photos from the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder scene, it was particularly gruesome, with internal organs and even genitalia hanging from the ceiling. From the power outage to the discovery, the entire crime took less than half an hour, including committing the crime, setting the fire, and dismembering the body.

A terrifying thought occurred to me:

The killer might not be acting alone.

Why was there a fire? Such a high-end entertainment venue couldn't possibly lack fire prevention facilities. Moreover, the case file clearly showed alcohol residue, but this clue wasn't emphasized during the trial; instead, the focus was on the witnesses and physical evidence.

Ordinary alcoholic drinks couldn't have caused such a massive fire; it must have been something with a higher alcohol content. From setting up the scene to committing the murder and dismembering the body, one person couldn't accomplish it in such a short time.

If Lally and Tammy were employees of the Entertainment Club, they could easily set up the scene. Bob, Mike, Tom, and Tony could then commit the crime in a short time. But what about dismembering the body?

In such a short time, they needed to precisely locate the organs, and the cuts were precise, with no signs of brute force. The dismemberment was very skillful, indicating it wasn't their first time.

Only someone who legally engaged in such work could have done this. This person had to be present and have a significant grudge against the suspects.

Joseph.

The five of them carried out the murder, dismemberment, and hanging of the body, then set a fire to destroy the evidence, leaving no trace of the victim's identity.

Of course, all this is just speculation without any evidence.

Why put all the blame on Laura? Was it just because Laura acted with impunity and abused of power?

If they had such a sense of justice, why didn't they report child trafficking earlier and let society and the law handle it instead of taking matters into their own hands?

Who is this Douglas that Ronald mentioned earlier?

"Over twenty years ago, I had just started working at the police station and had just married Erica."

Ronald recalled, "One night, while on routine patrol, I got lost and ended up at an abandoned steel mill. It was an unregulated area where no one usually went. Back then, there were no maps or navigation systems, and there were no houses for miles around. I was young and embarrassed to call the station to admit I was lost, so I drove around aimlessly. Not far from a small path, I saw a child squatting under a tree. It was a scorching summer, but the child's condition was particularly strange, with black and purple lips and trembling all over. He was a boy, but his voice sounded like a girl's."

"I quickly picked him up and put him in the car, setting aside my pride, and told the captain my approximate location. I kept the phone on the entire way and rushed the child to the hospital. This child was Joseph. The doctor examined him and said he wasn't sick but had likely ingested some kind of drug."

Ronald lit a cigarette and continued slowly, "Birth control pills."

Accidental ingestion was impossible. In such a hellish place, how could he accidentally ingest such a thing? Most likely, they had been giving Joseph these pills all along.

Why would such a young child be given these pills?

"Do you know what a sex pet is?"

I was slightly stunned and nodded." Were they trying to groom sex pets from a young age? But what does that have to do with birth control pills?"

"Lumaria has a special industry. Individuals start as men but gradually become 'transgender,' with the appearance of women but the physiology of men. This isn't a disease but a form of artificial modification. From a young age, these children are given female hormones, which can be expensive. The best alternative is birth control pills, which are cheap and contain high levels of female hormones."

Ronald stared intently at the Entertainment Club building, his eyes dry and devoid of any light, like a stone sculpture, staring at it for over twenty years.

"Are you saying they gave Joseph these pills to sell him...?"

I was shocked, beyond anger. Such behavior, worse than scum, had happened here.

"Not for sale, but to customize... for certain people. But Joseph was lucky. His body produced a lot of male hormones, and the excessive intake caused a rejection reaction. They probably thought Joseph was dying and threw him out."

Ronald's face was extremely grim as he said bitterly, "That's what he later told me. The children in that place weren't orphans; they all had parents. Most of them were born in remote rural areas and sold by their parents for a few thousand dollars. When they were just starting to understand the world, they were abandoned."

So Alan, Lally, and the others were like that... Just as I was thinking, Ronald continued,

"You know about Lally. When girls grow up, they can't escape that fate. Boys... have it worse. Tom is blind in one eye, not from birth, but because it was gouged out and sold when he was locked in a room and drugged as a child."

"Some children look whole on the outside, but they might have had organs replaced when they were very young. Back then, the law wasn't well-established, and children's organs..."

"Stop."

I nearly shouted to interrupt Ronald's narrative. For Alan and the others, fate had shown no mercy, only constant torment. At that moment, I seemed to understand their obsession with revenge, their almost fanatical, reckless revenge.

They had all come from hell. Surviving was a great act of courage and luck. Revenge was a natural human instinct. Alan was like a ray of light shining into the hearts of them.

Cleansing the filth from their bodies, gently comforting them. But did he ever think that he was also scarred?

Since learning he was alive, my heart seemed to come alive. Suppressing the near-mad joy, I tried to control myself, slowly investigating, slowly searching for him, not losing my focus. But I really wanted to see him. Where was he now? Why did he disappear? Why didn't he come to see me?

Ronald's eyes were red, his voice hoarse, "I wanted to save them, but those children advised me not to come back. I told my superiors, but they ignored me and ordered me not to investigate. As a police officer, I couldn't save them, so I could only occasionally sneak them some food."

"Those children were so kind and lovely, but after a while, one of them would be missing. When I asked about it, they would avoid answering, saying they were worried about bringing trouble to me. They were only a few years old; their understanding is heartbreaking. I could only climb, keep climbing higher. One day, I would have enough power to uproot them. If they were alive, I would chase them to the ends of the earth. If they were dead, the truth would come out, and they wouldn't rest in peace!"

"But..."

Ronald looked up at the sky, tears streaming from his eyes, "When I thought I was high enough, but I realized the sky was still above me."

###chapter 91 The Fire and the Foster Father (1)

Some people uphold justice throughout their lives, taking pride in their profession;

Some people live their lives driven by hatred, living for their goals;

Justice that extends into the path of darkness will ultimately find no redemption, while the flower of hatred breeds the hope of the light of humanity.

Lally and Tony are the latter, while Ronald is the former.

This man has been chasing criminals for twenty years, enduring day and night, climbing step by step in the field of power, fighting against heaven and fate in the name of justice, with the strength of a mortal, using marriage and family as stakes, losing everything, and falling into the abyss.

He stared at the Entertainment Club, recalling the figures of the children. I have the illusion that his initial pursuit of justice might have turned into an obsession, or even hatred.

I had seen this expression before when Frank mentioned Laura, a bloody aura all over him, that ferocious expression, as if they had no emotions, like skeletons crawling out of coffins, walking the world with a mask.

The difference is, that Frank's hatred is towards others, while Ronald's hatred is towards his own helplessness in the face of fate.

"Lally is missing, Joseph has been taken away for investigation..."

Ronald squinted his eyes, smoke swirling around him, the smell of smoke wafting over to me, making me cough twice, "Having sex with a male leader... has already sown the seeds of hatred, causing them to take root and sprout?

"Let me think, let me think... among these people, the only two people who could have thought of this idea are Alan and Frank."

As he spoke, Ronald turned to look at me and asked, "Who do you think is the mastermind behind this plan?"

"What do you mean?"

I frowned and asked back, following his words.

Ronald had been acting strange since he started crying earlier, which made me more vigilant. After being in a state of high mental tension for so many years, suddenly discovering that the children he once helped had turned around and deceived him, this feeling of betrayal was naturally hard to bear.

Could it be that the arson and murder case at the Entertainment Club was orchestrated by Alan himself?

"Don't be nervous, stop your suspicions." Ronald waved his hand and explained, "Having witnessed the brink of life and death many times, my words might be a bit abrupt. I'm fine, you don't need to worry, and the question I just asked wasn't targeting Alan or the arson and murder case at the Entertainment Club."

"I was talking about Joseph... Joseph is married and has a good relationship with his wife, is that true?"

I nodded. From Evelyn's expression and description, their relationship was indeed good, otherwise, she wouldn't have almost stood at the courthouse door until her legs gave out.

"Joseph is not someone who seeks power and wealth, so the only way for him to get close to that leader is that someone arranged it."

Ronald extinguished the cigarette butt, rubbed his temples, and continued, "Alan is simple and mature; he's the leader of these kids, and always guides them, so he probably wouldn't do something like this, but Frank is a different story."

Ronald smiled strangely, "This guy has been scheming since he was a child, full of calculations, very suspicious, never easily trusting others; even me, he was always on guard. It's strange that their personalities are opposite, yet they have a very good relationship."

"Have they always had such a good relationship?"

I asked, wanting to understand why they had such a big conflict with Laura, hoping for her death, what exactly happened?

I always felt that Tammy was the most unexpected. Even if there were conflicts among them, why did Tammy get involved? Was it just because Tony's disability was directly related to Laura?

"I don't know, among these kids, I'm most familiar with Joseph and Lally. The rest were told to me by an informant." Ronald said.

"An informant?"

"Yes, you mentioned this person earlier, Sand Village George." Ronald said, sighing, "Escaping the control of the trafficking group is not easy. When Alan escaped, the old steel mill started to strengthen control. They made these kids steal things and transport drugs. If they ran away and were caught, they would be beaten to death."

"George originally wanted to adopt Alan, but Alan begged George to adopt Tom, who had just had his eyeballs removed. How to adopt? Just a word? No... George bought Tom back."

"Tom was bought back by George?"

I exclaimed, then thought, "Indeed, escaping the clutches of evil is not easy, how could those kids easily run away?"

"Yes, at that time, I was investigating the laid-off workers at the old steel mill, suspecting that they were involved. That's when I met George. He was a good man, reportedly the foreman there. At that time, kids often went to Sand Village to beg. He wanted to save them, and the first one he saved was Alan."

Alan had such a deep connection with Tony's family.

No wonder when I saw Tammy again, her eyes were so kind, so that's why.

"Alan begged George to save Tom, and it was then that George became my informant, bought Tom back, and also established contact with those people."

Ronald said, pointing in the direction of the Entertainment Club, "This is their old nest, but not the only place, otherwise it would have been discovered sooner or later. They change places every once in a while, moving around Silverlight City, which is why they haven't been discovered by others."

"Did you see clearly? What kind of people are they?"

"No." Ronald's expression was serious, shaking his head, "To buy a child, you don't go to their old nest, but arrange a place in advance, then someone brings the child over, very cautious, that person wears a mask, so when we went to pick up Tom, we didn't see the person clearly."

"So, there was a next time, this time it was a girl. Not long after, George and the little girl had an accident and both died."

I remembered that when I went to Sand Village before, the breakfast shop owner mentioned that George had adopted a little girl. The girl was playful and wild, accidentally igniting the gasoline warehouse at the old steel mill, and George died in the fire trying to save her, neither of them made it out.

"You were half right." Ronald said with a strange expression, as if he couldn't understand, "The information I got later was that it wasn't an accident."

"What!"

"George had been investigating that organization, but he was inexperienced and lacked professional tracking skills. Before long, he was targeted by those people."

###chapter 92 The Fire and the Foster Father (2)

"Although most of the children here are controlled by them, they also select a few obedient ones to manage and supervise the others. Before adopting the little girl, a boy ran to Sand Village. Guess who that boy was?"

"Douglas."

I blurted out. It was the first time I had heard this name today. But hearing Ronald say this, it became clear that some of the children, sharing the same fate, must have betrayed their original companions and sided with the organization for a better living environment or simply to survive, even if it meant harming other children in the same situation.

"Very good. Zoey mentioned that you worked at the prosecutor's office and that you were mentored by Deputy Chief Prosecutor Leonard. I believe it now. You are indeed outstanding among the police."

Ronald looked at me with admiration. "That's right. The one who betrayed his companions and sided with the enemy was Douglas. He received orders to secretly investigate Sand Village but got exposed."

"He saw Alan," I sighed.

"Yes, George's actions were completely exposed. The organization, fearing their secrets would be leaked, came up with a plan. George wanted to adopt another girl, so they sent one to him at a very low price."

"So, the little girl was an undercover sent by them to silence George, which led to the later incident where George was lured to the old steel mill and killed?"

I felt a chill. That little girl was only a few years old, yet she had such profound thoughts to deceive a man in his thirties. What kind of ideas were being instilled in children there, leading them to commit such heinous acts?

Even more terrifying, she succeeded.

"It wasn't deception. George mentioned to me that the little girl seemed fake. He recognized it at the first glance. I told him his safety was the most important and to send the girl back and halt the investigation."

Ronald looked somber. "But he said it wasn't her fault that she was controlled at such a young age. He didn't want to see her life ruined, even if it meant risking his own life to save her."

"A big fire, and overnight, everything disappeared. George died, the organization vanished, and the children fled. I was busy contacting welfare institutions to find them a place to stay. But no matter how much I asked, they refused to say who those people were or what they looked like."

Even in the face of danger, they never gave up on saving others.

George was like that, and so was Alan. Perhaps it was because of their similar nature that brought them together in Sand Village, leading to the stories that followed.

As I pondered, I suddenly wondered how Ronald knew the little girl was a trap.

The story I heard was that the girl died in the fire with George. If she was part of a plan, why would she put herself in danger?

I remembered that when I first visited Tammy's house, there was only a photo of George on the TV, not the little girl.

Most importantly, Tammy mentioned she had only two children, implying she disregarded the adopted girl. After all, she was an adopted child, so they had a parental relationship in the name. If the girl had died, why wasn't her photo next to George's memorial?

There was only one possibility, Tammy later learned the truth, and the girl didn't die.

Considering Tammy and Tony's involvement, a terrifying thought emerged in my mind.

The girl they adopted might have been Laura.

If so, the children who grew up together would harbor resentment upon discovering a traitor among them.

Tom, Tammy, and Tony's hatred for Laura would be understandable-it was a deep-seated grudge for killing their father and husband.

"Have you seen the adopted girl?"

If Ronald had seen her, it couldn't be Laura.

"No, she was there for less than half a month before the incident."

"Have you seen Laura? What is she like?"

"Yes," Ronald nodded. "A girl who cried a lot, very pretty. Her parents were from the countryside. After she was born, they had a son a few years later. They couldn't afford to raise two children, so they sold Laura when she was four. She was sold a few more times before ending up with the organization."

Ronald paused, realizing something. "Are you saying the girl George adopted was Laura?"

I nodded. "It's just a hypothesis, but it would explain why these people are targeting her."

"The logic fits, but it might be like drawing a target around an arrow."

Ronald thought carefully. "If the girl was Laura and she stayed in Sand Village for over half a month, Alan and Tom would have recognized her. And if Laura was the one who killed George, why wait over twenty years to act?"

That's true. Laura was close to Alan, Frank, Mike, and Bob in college. If she was the adopted girl, how could they have had such a good relationship?

But there were inconsistencies. Ronald's description of Laura as a child didn't match her current persona.

The Laura I knew was arrogant, and self-centered. According to Frank, she was even more ruthless in her pursuit of fame and fortune, willing to do anything and resorting to all sorts of wickedness.

It didn't align with the image of a crying little girl.

There was another thing I couldn't understand. The only reason Ronald could know the truth about this matter is that he has an informant within that organization.

There's only one possibility that his informant is not just a buyer, but also someone inside the organization.

"So you have an informant who told you the truth. This person isn't from Sand Village but from within the organization and knows the children well, right?"

"Yes. If that person were still around, the children's grudges would be clear, and we might know who the adopted girl was."

"What do you mean? Is he no longer around?"

I felt a pang of disappointment. Why was I always a step behind?

"No. He fell ill a few years ago and can't speak now. He's being cared for by one of the children he once helped. What's his name..."

"Right, Bob."

###chapter 93 On the Interpretation of Heroes

Ronald told a long story.

It was about the old steel mill, child trafficking, and the police.

From the perspective of a grassroots police officer twenty years ago, it was a story about justice and willpower. If this were a TV series, it would have ended right here.

Life was often more exciting than fiction.

He gave up on life, on marriage, on family, exhausted all his luck, and climbed to the highest place to shout, to fulfill a wish of more than twenty years, but above his head was still the sky.

Twenty years later, he fell from the heights and disappeared into the crowd. With wrinkled skin and an empty body, he numbed his failures and hardships with one cigarette after another. Even his daughter didn't know his situation.

Death was the ultimate destination for heroes; the heroic believers were cheered by the mundane. Those who fell to the mortal world never caused a ripple in others' lives.

This was also heroism, real, tragic heroism.

Heroism had never been a performance or a concept. It didn't appear in the lens; rather, it was a great quality. It was walking out of the abyss, dancing with darkness and danger, seeing through the baseness and darkness of human nature, and still singing high praises to the light of humanity.

Compassion was not giving him a piece of bread, a bottle of water, or some encouraging words; more often, it was a resonance deep in the heart with the weak, a subtle mixture of morality and humanity.

The hero melted his armor into compassion, giving annotations and practices to the rules of humanity.

Breaking free from the shackles of fate, he was not controlled by time.

Knowing there was deceit, he still walked into the sea of fire, to save that girl. It was too late to debate whether human nature is good or evil. Waving a hand, he left a vast blank, saying goodbye to the world.

Coming out of the abyss, bright and upright, he seemed to be born this way. Wherever he went, there was light. God became a boy walking in the world, whether right or wrong, everyone respected him immensely, reminisced and admired him.

George and Alan were like this.

Ronald went to another extreme; he locked himself up, took out a knife, and cut off all the weaknesses of his body, except for Zoey, where he left the last bit of warmth.

If Alan and George represented light, Ronald was the back of the light.

He was like an aging jailer, with rusty torture tools, broken iron shackles, decayed fetters, and only that knife, which he sharpened every day.

Staring at the Entertainment Club building, waiting for the final blow, it didn't matter if he died the next moment.

Before I left, I asked him why he kept staring here. Douglas was already dead, and people related to the child trafficking group couldn't possibly appear here.

He shook his head without explaining.

I asked him again, who was the protector behind this, what big figure was behind it, and at what high level.

He shook his head with a bitter expression and told me to be careful-safety first. He urged me to find Alan, and once I did, to leave Silverlight City and never come back.

I felt a strange sense of guilt. This place is like a prison, he locked himself in, with the guilt for the dead children more than twenty years ago. The one he hated most in his heart was himself.

But I couldn't do anything for him, even a little help.

I wouldn't leave Silverlight City, even if I fould Alan, I would pursue the truth to the end.

After walking a few steps, he called me back, stammering and asking, "how Zoey was doing now, and was she happy at Howard's company?"

I smiled and said gently," Zoey often talks about you, she always has you in her heart as her father. If you make her a hamburger like just now, I think she would be so happy she couldn't sleep."

Ronald sighed, said that he wouldn't see her again, and told me to let Zoey live happily and not let her get involved.

I nodded and drove home.

We talked for nearly four hours, and it was already past eight in the evening.

The story of that year became clearer. From Ronald's perspective, the past of Sand Village truly unveiled the mystery.

The old steel mill was likely first discovered by the outside world when Ronald was still a young police officer. He lost his way and found Joseph, who was abandoned by the criminal group due to excessive intake of female hormones causing physical reactions.

This also explained from another angle why Joseph looked so delicate, which was not a natural gift, but the torment of fate.

But Joseph later went back and did not accept Ronald's help.

As time went on, Ronald continued to investigate the case, and at this time, Alan should have beenthe first child to escape from the old steel mill, then lived in Sand Village with George's help. George noticed the secret of the old steel mill, met Ronald during the investigation, and then adopted Tom, who had an eye removed.

During George's investigation, he was also exposed, and soon targeted by the criminal group, which sent a five or six-year-old child, Douglas, to Sand Village to investigate him. At this time, Alan's information was also exposed; the criminal group took advantage of George's desire to save children and sold a little girl to George at a low price.

The little girl and the criminal group set up a trap to lure George to the old steel mill, where George died in a big fire, and the criminal group disappeared.

Later, Lally and Duke also escaped from the fire and went to Sand Village to live with Alan and Tom.

The remaining Frank, Joseph, Mike, Bob, and Laura were unknown.

The story of Sand Village should have a general outline here.

The key was, who was the daughter George adopted. I started to suspect it was Laura because Tammy, Tony, and Laura had no direct conflict on the surface, just the original residents of Sand Village. If Laura is the culprit who caused George's death, then all this made sense.

But Ronald objected, if the adopted girl was Laura, Alan and others wouldn't have such a good relationship with her in college, and wouldn't wait until now to act.

This was one of the doubts.

Secondly, the mastermind behind the Entertainment Club's conspiracy should be Frank; the motive to kill Douglas was obvious. Douglas was one of the children turned by the criminals, so they bullied other children. Thinking of Tom, Joseph, Lally, and even Frank's serious illness, which is related to these children, having a grudge was inevitable.

But why targeted Laura?

Ronald's words were not unreasonable. If Laura was the one who caused George's death, Alan would never be so close to Laura in college.

There was only one possibility.

Something happened in college.

###chapter 94 Breakthrough

The only people who could answer this question were the members of the University Five.

Alan disappeared, Laura was controlled, and Frank never told the truth.

But from Ronald, I got a crucial piece of information that the day Alan went to the Entertainment Club, two people were waiting for him downstairs.

Ronald could name those two people, Bob and Mike.

After the arson and murder case at the Entertainment Club, Douglas's body was burned and disguised as Alan's. Everyone set Laura up. As for Alan's current whereabouts, I thought Lally and Tony knew, but they didn't say. However, when I recalled their expressions when talking about Alan, they didn't show sadness or worry, indicating that he should be safe for now.

When Frank first met me, he cried his eyes out. He was afraid that the plan had gone wrong and Alan was dead. Later, when he learned the truth and we met at the hospital, his expression was completely different when Alan was mentioned, indirectly proving that Alan wasn't dead. At the same time, I felt that Alan wasn't with him.

So the result was obvious that Alan's whereabouts must be related to Bob and Mike.

The most unexpected discovery was that Ronald's informant at the old steel mill was now being taken care of by Bob. Although a severe illness a few years ago left him unable to speak, as long as he's alive, there would be information. Whether from Bob or Mike, we could find out what happened during their university days.

I took out my phone and looked through the information Howard had previously investigated.

Mike was an English teacher at Harmony City Community College. I remembered when I called him, his voice was particularly despondent and listless. He only got excited after knowing it was me and started talking on his own, clearly stating that he had nothing to do with this matter.

Bob was an actor in the Shadow City Drama Troupe. Besides Laura, he was the only one from their university drama club who continued to work in theater after graduation.

The difference was, when I called him, it wasn't him who answered but a woman who said Bob had just gone to sleep and hinted that I shouldn't believe everything a man said.

At first, I thought Bob frequently changed girlfriends in college and was known as a playboy. His acting talent wasn't as good as Laura's or Frank's, but the gap wasn't that big. The key was that Bob was very handsome and sociable, changing girlfriends frequently.

But now that I thought about it, I had reason to suspect that after the Entertainment Club incident, Bob went back to Shadow City the next day and went to sleep. He naturally didn't tell his girlfriend the truth, which led to this situation.

The urgent task now was to go to Shadow City to find Bob and the informant from the old steel mill, and figure out who the little girl was that caused George's death and what exactly happened during their university days.

By the time I finished packing at home, it was already nearly 10 p.m. I lay on the sofa and planned my itinerary for tomorrow.

Shadow City was southeast of Silverlight City and one of the least-known cities in the state, ranking at the bottom economically. Many people in Silverlight City didn't even know Shadow City. Shadow City was right next to Silverlight City, but it was small and built at the foot of a mountain, making it inconvenient to travel to, so few people went there.

But students of Silverlight University all knew about Shadow City. When we were in college, the Silverlight University branch campus was actually in Shadow City. Later, as Silverlight City expanded, the campus naturally became part of Silverlight City.

Due to the poor traffic conditions, driving there tomorrow would take about two hours. Silverlight City and Shadow City were separated by the north-south boundary ridge, and driving between the two cities required taking a winding mountain road and passing through several tunnels, which was very troublesome.

On my way home, I sent Bob's personal information to Ruben for help. By the time I got home, Ruben had already asked a colleague in the household registration department to find Bob's address. He didn't live in the city but in a small town, so driving there would take at least three hours.

It was better to take the high-speed train, which would take at most forty minutes. After getting off the train, I could take a taxi to the town, which would take about twenty minutes according to the navigation.

After booking a high-speed train ticket for 8 AM tomorrow, I was about to go to sleep when Zoey sent a message.

[Mrs. Smith, where did you go today? Let me guess!]

[Why aren't you asleep yet? I heard from Howard that you've been working a lot lately. Take care of yourself; your health comes first. Don't overwork yourself.]

Although I couldn't let Zoey get involved in this case, it didn't mean I had to cut ties with her. On the contrary, I had been in contact with Zoey these days. I just tried to be vague about case-related matters. Even so, Zoey could independently judge and find out that Joseph had issues.

From this, I had to marvel at the power of genetics. Zoey's work efficiency was exceptionally high, and she learned things quickly, just like her mother Erica. I had experienced Zoey's talent in law. Her talent in criminal investigation might come from her father Ronald.

[Mrs. Smith, don't say that. Mr. Martin is working me to death, making me do everything. I feel like a slave, working 24 hours a day!]

I smiled knowingly. Zoey was playing the victim again. A few days ago, Howard showed me Zoey's performance report. Her workload had increased, but it was far from overwhelming.

[Where can you find such a beautiful slave? I have seen your performance report. Your efficiency is super high. I'm starting to feel threatened!]

[Don't think I don't know. You and Mr. Martin are conspiring to keep me out of this case, right? But I still found out that Joseph has issues. How about that? Under your guidance, my skills aren't bad, right?]

This girl, when did I ever teach her anything about criminal investigation? Giving me credit for this was unfair, so I typed:

[I have to marvel at the power of genetics. I think you are like your mother, but I don't expect...]

[Don't expect me to be like my dad too, right?] Zoey sent a smiling emoji and continued: [So you went to the True Love Entertainment Club today to see my dad just for praising me, right?]

Something's off. How did Zoey know I went to the Entertainment Club area to find Ronald today?

Did Howard tell her?

As I was thinking, the sound of a Facebook video notification went off. Zoey was sending a video invitation.

###chapter 95 Zoey's Plea

A few days without seeing Zoey, she was wearing pajamas, lying on the bed facing the camera, her eyes blinking, still looking smart and mischievous.

But compared to usual, there was a noticeable fatigue in her eyes, despite her efforts to hide it with a smile. As someone who spent every day with her, I knew my apprentice very well.

"Forget about the Entertainment Club for now, why do you look so exhausted? If you can't finish your work, just pass it on to someone else. My apprentice is not someone who can be used for any job in the company. I'll go ask Howard!"

Had Howard been giving Zoey too much work lately?

This was too harsh. It was not necessary to use workload to drain Zoey's time and energy. If it didn't work out, she could be assigned some business trips to temporarily leave Silverlight City.

I turned and sent a message to Howard:

[What's going on? Why does Zoey look so exhausted? How much work did you give her?]

[What do you mean how much work? Did Zoey come to you to complain again? Your apprentice almost set my office on fire these past two days. I'm the boss, and I was so scared I didn't dare come to the office. She was talking to me about labor laws. How could I not know her workload? I gave her a vacation the day before yesterday, along with a round-trip ticket to a foreign tourist spot. I even booked the hotel. My goodness, is there any other boss like me in the world? The employee is too aggrieved, and the boss spends his own money to send the employee on a trip abroad.]

[Zoey went abroad?]

[Yes, I sent her on the plane!]

[When?]

[Last night!]

I switched back to Zoey's video interface. She was beaming, humming a song while holding an iPad and watching videos. Wasn't this background her bedroom?

Got it, Zoey flew there and then bought a ticket back.

Just to escape Howard's control.

But how did she know I went to find Ronald?

"Did you finish asking?"

Zoey leaned closer to the camera on the other side of the video, smiling ingratiatingly, probably feeling guilty.

"So you were following me yesterday."

I frowned in displeasure, not because Zoey followed me, but because Howard, Ronald, and I had agreed that Zoey should not be involved again.

"No way!" Zoey sniffed and made a funny face.

"It was the day before yesterday. I overheard your call with Mr. Martin. You said you were going home to accompany your dad. I didn't eavesdrop; Mr. Martin's voice was so loud that it was hard not to hear. So I thought, if you didn't tell me the progress, I'll find out myself."

"So, when we went to True Love Entertainment Club to find Lally, you recognized your father from a distance, didn't you?"

Zoey's expression darkened, and she said softly, "I wasn't sure at the time. When we went downstairs and took the ambulance away, I glanced at the window, and it was him. He thought he could hide by lowering his head, but I recognized him."

"That's my dad. I should be able to recognize him. He always keeps it from me, making me believe he is still the pride of the Silverlight City Criminal Investigation Team, the model for all criminal investigators in this city. He is still a legend."

Zoey's eyes turned red, tears welling up, biting her lip, she said softly, "I know, I know everything... My dad kept it from me, Mr. Martin kept it from me, my mom kept it from me, but how could I not guess?"

"The office of the captain of the state criminal investigation team has long been replaced. Fathers always think their children never grow up. A simple 'Dad is busy' is enough, thinking I wouldn't go looking for him. But I went long ago."

I was momentarily speechless, not knowing how to comfort her. After a long time, I said gently, "He has endured a lot of suffering, too many disappointments that we can't understand. I can feel that he is on the verge of collapse, facing despair, and you have become his only salvation."

"So, Mrs. Smith, I also want to investigate further. I can't let my dad's twenty years of persistence go to waste which will be a huge blow to anyone. Family, affection, status, power... He has lost too much. He is like a blade of grass in a hurricane, ready to break at any moment."

With Zoey's intelligence, she must have heard about Ronald's twenty-year pursuit of the criminal. She recognized Ronald the first time we went to the Entertainment Club but didn't know why he was there. When I told her the Entertainment Club's location was the old steel factory where children were trafficked, everything became clear.

It wasn't hard to deduce that Ronald and I were investigating the same case from different angles and times.

In other words, Zoey's keen interest in this case and her determination to get involved stemmed from her past relationship with me and Alan and her father's persistence.

But the potential danger of this case was unpredictable. We couldn't ignore the existence of danger before it arrived. Before it arrived, it was called danger; after it arrived, it was a disaster.

"Mrs. Smith, let me investigate with you... please."

Zoey pleaded again.

I was resolute this time, not softening my heart to agree. I informed Howard about Zoey's situation, asking him to keep an eye on her and not let her run around. I planned to go to Shadow City tomorrow and wouldn't be in Silverlight City for the next couple of days.

The moon rose, and after so many busy days, tonight at home was the most peaceful.

I had a premonition that this matter was nearing its end, and we would soon have answers.

The urgent task was to find Alan. I firmly believed he was still alive, just caught in an unexpected situation during Frank's planned operation.

I believed in Alan. He must have gone to mediate after suddenly receiving the news, not as a participant.

His favorite poetry collection was still on the sofa. I hadn't moved it, perhaps subconsciously feeling he was still there, but I never opened it.

It was a complex and contradictory emotion. People often oscillated between illusion and reality or deceived themselves. At that time, I knew Alan was gone, but I kept his favorite book nearby as if he were with me.

But I never opened it because I feared the memories would overwhelm me.

People always found a seemingly perfect solution, but it was still self-deception.

I opened Alan's previous notebook, where he had written poems.

"If I say I love you, I will love your past, your tantrums, your imperfections."

"If I say I love you, I will offer my heart, lungs, and all my organs to the god of love who has fallen into hell."

"If I say I love you, I will drain my blood, leaving only my skin to wrap your soul, avoiding the pursuit of death."

"If I say I love you, we will kiss passionately, tongues entwined, bodies merging, a fire dissolving sin and pain."

"We will meet eventually."

This poem itself was nothing special. I turned the page.

Just like life, or all unfortunate events, encounters, and disasters, this page of the book must be turned.

The second page was blank.

But on the back of the first page, written faintly in pencil:

Douglas.

###chapter 96 Guidance

It had been many years since I last took a train.

In my perception, there was not much difference between high-speed trains and regular trains, except for the speed.

If I was pursuing efficiency, I would choose to fly, rushing to the interview with round-trip tickets reimbursed by the company.

Otherwise, I would take the train. The sound of the wheels rubbing against the tracks had a mysterious rhythm, and it suddenly reminded me of what Alan once said, that it was the mark of time passing.

The last time I took a high-speed train was probably a few years ago when I accompanied my mom on a trip down memory lane.

At that time, my mom's health was already failing, and I vaguely felt that she didn't have much time left. She was very open about it, saying she had no regrets in her life but didn't want to be lying in bed with tubes all over her body. Instead, she kept comforting me and my dad, and Alan, who was silently standing by with red-rimmed eyes.

That night, she called me and asked if I could take some time off to accompany her to visit her hometown, the place where she spent her childhood.

My mom was a woman from Peach Blossom Town in the South. After graduating from college, she married my dad and rarely went back. When a person reached the end of their journey, they always thought of the starting point.

I was about to book plane tickets, but my mom said we should take the train back because that was how she came at first.

Considering my mom's health, I booked a sleeper berth, but most of the time, she sat on a small chair in the corridor, looking very excited, eagerly gazing at the scenery outside the window like a child on their first trip.

Peach Blossom Town in the South was beautiful, especially for someone like me who was born and raised in the North. My mom took me to her old house where she had spent her childhood. There were the lotus leaves in the pond, the small river by the street, and the fragrance of Southern breakfast wafting in the morning.

It was hard to imagine how my mom, as a Southerner, adapted to the Northern climate, with dry seasons and unbearably cold winters.

I remembered the afternoon before we left; it was overcast, with a drizzle, like a brush roughly turning the whole world into shades of gray and black.

I held an orange umbrella for my mom, and we walked shoulder to shoulder on the cobblestone-paved street.

"I don't expect it, thirty years have passed since I left. I have thought a lot on the way; it is messy and chaotic. But when I got here, I realized that my life was strung together by a thread. I have been searching for it, and when I find this thread, everything become beautiful."

"Mom, what is your thread?"

"It's you and your dad, Nancy. What about you?"

I snapped out of my memories and closed the notebook Alan had left behind.

"If I say I love you, I will love your past, your tantrums, your imperfections."

"If I say I love you, I will offer my heart, lungs, and all my organs to the god of love who has fallen into hell."

"If I say I love you, I will drain my blood, leaving only my skin to wrap around your soul, evading the pursuit of death."

"If I say I love you, we will kiss passionately, our tongues entwined, our bodies merging, a fire dissolving sin and pain."

"We will eventually meet."

This was not a love poem, nor did it have anything to do with Alan's novels. It was a guide, and it was very different from Alan's usual style and tone; it was more like written by someone else.

The organs mentioned in the poem, such as "heart" and "lungs," were almost identical to the scene where Douglas's body parts were hung from the ceiling in the Entertainment Club arson and murder case.

"Draining my blood, leaving only my skin" also matched the scene where the body was burned to a crisp.

"A fire dissolving sin and pain" referred to the fire at the Entertainment Club, but the dissolution of sin and pain here was a metaphor. As of now, it seemed that nothing had been dissolved. Tony and Lally were still missing, and Frank's revenge plan was still in motion.

From the day I saw this poem, then the photos of the scene, and received the call to identify the body, the emotional span was too great. During these two months of running around and investigating, everything was connected, and I never noticed this poem.

Perhaps I was always avoiding it, avoiding Alan's departure, locking the study, closing the bedroom door, and never going in again.

Instead, I ignored the most important clue right beside me.

Alan seemed to have anticipated this happening. He started planning early, trying to stop this terrifying revenge action. At the same time, he left a backup plan. If something happened to him, I could continue the investigation based on the clues he left, or the bodies at the Entertainment Club could lead to conclusions.

But I didn't realize this at the time. By a twist of fate, I uncovered the child trafficking in Sand Village and the old steel mill and learned about their backgrounds.

Fortunately, the information I uncovered was more in-depth, but it didn't deviate from the case itself.

I suddenly thought, if this was a guide, then the insurance policy printout placed on top of the documents when I was investigating the Sand Village demolition and brawl case in the company archives was probably put there by Alan.

I never thought in this direction, but it seemed that the only person who could enter the company and know the archive room password was Alan.

When I first came to the Silverlight City Journal, I worked day and night. Alan would bring me meals after work. At that time, I was building an electronic cloud document, putting all the case files in it. Alan helped me find information, and that was when he learned the archive room password.

I thought, "Yes, that's right." The last time Alan came to the office was just a month before the incident.

It was around early October. There was an article, and Zoey and I were working overtime on it. After we finished, Alan came to pick us up. When we got downstairs, I realized I had forgotten my keys, so Alan went up to get them. It was probably then that he put the copy of the insurance policy for Tammy in the archive room.

So, Alan had thought this far ahead. He anticipated that something might happen at the class reunion, and if I knew he was in trouble, I might overlook important clues in my panic. So, while investigating Sand Village, knowing that Tammy and Lally were giving false testimony but unable to find the relevant people, the appearance of the insurance policy led to the important clues of Tony and Tom, and Tom being Tammy's adopted son Zack.

Alan could predict this far because he already knew about this meticulous plan in advance, starting with killing Douglas and framing Laura-a strategy that killed two birds with one stone， and then having Tammy, Tom, and Lally testify, which would firmly trap Laura with the evidence.

The logic worked, but I overlooked an important issue.

They wanted to bring Laura down, but the evidence was insufficient. Laura's lawyer's defense in court was spot on.

Lally and Tammy had low education levels and might not understand the law well, but Frank, as the organizer of this plan, if he didn't understand the law, that would be unreasonable. Someone of his status would have a team of lawyers serving him.

Currently, Laura is still in custody, and it's unlikely she'll be sentenced to death.

According to the investigation, the higher-ups have started a cleanup operation, and naturally, they want to take down Laura. Frank and others have a grudge against Laura, so they naturally want to take her down too.

But if that's the case, Laura wouldn't be alive now.

Wait!

What if Frank was protecting Laura?

###chapter 97 When Did You Get Here?

I broke out in a cold sweat.

All along, I had always thought that Laura was the target of everyone's criticism.

If that were the case, Laura wouldn't have survived until now.

If it were the big shots above who wanted Laura dead, Tony, Tom, Lally, and Tammy would also want Laura dead.

But what if Frank didn't?

I heard from Howard that Frank had been plagued by illness for years, his health had always been poor, and his love life was almost non-existent. I had never heard of any women around him, and he mentioned that his health had always been bad since childhood, and he had only survived until now by relying on money.

Weakness could create sensitivity, and sensitive people often had a more delicate understanding of emotions.

Frank's words were full of hatred for Laura, a hatred that stemmed from previous feelings, showing how deep his feelings for Laura were.

This also meant that Laura was likely the only woman Frank had ever loved, and perhaps he still had feelings for her. Given his health, he might not have much time left. In his final moments, would he want Laura dead?

What if all his anger stemmed from jealousy and love?

What if the side he showed was just a facade, and he was the one who wanted to protect Laura the most?

From here, my suspicion of Frank grew. He had never lived in Sand Village, his health had always been poor, and his current financial situation naturally could keep him alive. But what about when he was a child?

Back then, the organization that trafficked children from the old steel factory disappeared overnight after a big fire, and the children scattered. Some were taken in by orphanages and welfare homes with Ronald's help, some moved into Sand Village and lived with Alan and Tom.

So, what about Frank? Where did Bob, Laura, and Mike go?

What happened during those years, and was there still contact with Alan?

All of this would have to wait until I met Bob to find out.

I glanced at the time; it was half past eight.

Only half an hour had passed, and there was still an hour and a half of travel left.

This time, I had prepared in advance. Last night, I asked Ruben to help check on Bob from the Shadow City theater troupe. He had been going to and from work without any issues recently.

Before leaving this morning, I called Bob's phone number using another phone number, and it was indeed him who answered.

I had to be cautious. Many times, at critical moments, the witnesses suddenly disappeared, causing the investigation to stall.

The sound of the high-speed train continued. The the high-speed train alternated between the tracks and tunnels, the view outside the window flickering, making me drowsy.

I happened to be sitting by the window, with no one around. It wasn't a peak time during the holidays, so it was normal for the high-speed train to have some empty seats.

I opened my phone and saw a message from Howard on Facebook:

[Stay safe. Zoey is already under my control, she can't escape... Try to come back early. Alright, Zoey is causing a fuss. I've realized she's a backstabbing snake, who only listens to you. I wasted my concern for her.]

Then, Zoey sent a message right after:

[Mrs. Smith didn't take me. I guess Mr. Martin complained about me again, saying I caused trouble with him. That's not true. I finished the work he assigned me long ago. I went to hang out with my classmates. When Mrs. Smith comes back, let's go to True Love Entertainment Club together. I want to eat a burger, the one my dad makes.]

I couldn't help but laugh. Zoey and Howard seemed like a pair of bickering father and daughter. Howard was a notable figure in Silverlight City's business world, known for his good relationships and being decisive. Once he made up his mind, he always got things done.

Except for Zoey, Howard was very troubled. When there were others in the company, Zoey would politely call him boss. But once everyone else left, Zoey would swagger into Howard's office, giving him a stern look. Howard would hold his laptop, grumbling with dissatisfaction while sitting across from her, still smiling.

"Thanks for your hard work today. What do you want to eat this afternoon? This chair of mine cost tens of thousands of dollars; it's an ergonomic chair. How about I get you one too? You're young, you can't afford to have a herniated disc. I'm old now. How about this, call me godfather, and I'll hand over the company to you in the future. Not a bad deal, right, Zoey?"

Seeing Zoey's disregard for money, Howard felt like dying. He had no choice. Erica's business was indeed bigger than his, and over the years, Howard's business in Silverlight City had been smooth sailing. His tough stance in front of Tom was partly due to Erica backing him up.

Howard didn't feel guilty, often thinking it was Erica who should feel guilty.

Regardless of how successful Erica was in business, because of their past relationship and the situation with Zoey, she and Ronald could never hold their heads high in front of Howard. Every time Howard called, it was a long lecture.

No matter how domineering Howard was outside, he couldn't say a word in front of Zoey, looking like a helpless father facing his daughter.

I had to admit that there was always someone who could handle you.

Speaking of which, I suddenly remembered Benjamin, whom I hadn't contacted in a long time. He seemed very busy lately, taking a long time to reply to messages.

A few days ago, Cindy called. She was eight months pregnant and mentioned Benjamin's recent situation. He was supposed to come back soon but got caught up in a case and had to wait a bit longer. But he would be back before the baby was born.

Thinking about this, a wave of drowsiness hit me, and I unknowingly fell asleep leaning against the window.

To be precise, it was a half-asleep, half-awake state. I could still hear the sound of the high-speed train and the background music of short videos playing on someone's phone nearby. It was a bit noisy. I frowned but didn't wake up, vaguely hearing someone nearby telling them to lower the volume, saying it was a public space.

After a while, it quieted down around me.

With my eyes closed, I could still feel the light flickering around me. My mind was out of control as if I were speeding through the wilderness with the high-speed train, heading towards an endless destination.

I wanted to wake up but didn't want to open my eyes.

I was torn between dream and reality; waking up felt like jumping out of a plane.

I fought off the natural drowsiness, worried about missing my stop, and opened my eyes, quickly checking the time:

9:50 AM.

I breathed a sigh of relief, glad I hadn't missed my stop.

The lingering drowsiness made me feel a bit disoriented, but there was a cup of coffee right in front of me.

I looked up and saw a girl sitting across from me, wearing a pink hat and sunglasses that covered half her face. She was resting her chin on one hand, gazing out the window at the passing scenery, lost in thought.

She wore a gray wool coat with a green Bohemian-style dress underneath, looking both steady and fashionable.

I sighed, shaking my head repeatedly, and took out my phone to send a message to Howard. After thinking for a moment, I decided against it.

"Zoey, when did you get here?"

###chapter 98 Brothers from Different Parents

The other party remained unmoved as if she hadn't heard anything.

But the corners of her eyes, twitching beneath the sunglasses, betrayed her emotions.

"If you don't speak, after we arrive, I'll either take you back to the company first, or have Howard drive over to pick you up, and you can go back with him tonight."

"No, Mrs. Smith, I finally managed to get out."

Zoey pouted, took off her large sunglasses, looked at me, and pushed the coffee towards me with a pitiful look. She then smiled, took out two croissants and two crescent rolls from her bag, and cheerfully handed me one.

"Mrs. Smith, I bet you didn't have breakfast. How can you skip breakfast? Mr. Martin bought these for me this morning. I packed them up, bought coffee downstairs, and rushed to the high-speed rail station. I almost missed the train, which scared me to death."

As she spoke, she patted her chest dramatically, took a few deep breaths, and her eyes kept glancing at me.

Seeing that I still hadn't spoken, she immediately raised her hand and started to promise, "Mrs. Smith, don't worry. Wherever you go, I'll follow. If you don't let me step out of the room, I'll stay in the room and won't go anywhere."

Saying this, she ran over to sit next to me, hugged my arm, and said coquettishly, "Mrs. Smith, please."

Where did Zoey learn these shameless words? Howard never did this. I vaguely pictured Ruben in my mind. He must have given her these ideas and found out about my travel plans.

This girl.

"Have you been in touch with Ruben recently?"

Zoey's eyes lit up when she heard me speak. She smiled and asked, "Why do you ask? Do you think I'm with him?"

I was taken aback for a moment, then smiled, "Not really, but those lines words now sounded like Ruben."

"No!" Zoey laughed, unwrapped a croissant, and handed it to me, explaining, "Ruben did give me this idea, and he helped me check your ticket, but we're not in a relationship."

Zoey stood up, sat across from me, and said righteously, "After deep discussions and exchanges with Ruben, we shared our life insights and respected each other's emotional views. We decided to develop a new relationship that isn't constrained by traditional romantic ties."

"You sound a bit like Howard now." I shook my head, "You rejected Ruben."

"No! We decided to become brothers from different mothers!"

I was stunned for a moment, not understanding what she meant. Then I remembered some internet jokes from recent years and shook my head with a smile. I picked up the coffee Zoey bought for me and took a few sips. The coolness went straight to my throat, and my mind cleared up a lot.

"Mrs. Smith, I'm serious. Why are you laughing? Men and women can have relationships other than romantic ones!"

Zoey was embarrassed and angry, pouting.

"Did Ruben drive you to the high-speed rail station?" I didn't respond directly.

"Yes, otherwise, my car was taken by Mr. Martin, my bank card was frozen by my mom, and I spent all my salary. They are determined not to let me out. I couldn't even get a cab, so my brother had to help me." Zoey said seriously.

No wonder Howard's Facebook said Zoey couldn't escape. They were harsh, taking her car and freezing her bank card, completely locking down her travel. But they didn't expect Ruben, the leader of Zoey's fan club, to still be helping her.

Zoey suddenly remembered something, waved her hand, and said casually, "Mrs. Smith, don't worry. I'll pay him back double when I return. I can still owe him money."

"Was Ruben still watching you before you got on the train?" I nodded and smiled, continuing to ask.

Zoey nodded.

"How did you feel?"

Zoey shook her head.

"What did you say to him?"

Zoey was taken aback, scratched her head, and said embarrassedly, "I told him to get back to work. He was standing there in his police uniform, looking like a security guard. It was quite embarrassing."

This guy forgot to change out of his uniform again during non-working hours.

Forgot it, let them be. Both of them were clueless about relationships.

Back then, Alan and I thought Benjamin wouldn't win Cindy over, but that scene at the train station suddenly opened her heart. Now, in two months, their child will be born.

Would Zoey and Ruben be like that?

I didn't know, but calling each other brothers seemed a bit far-fetched.

It was not that I was overly conservative or didn't believe in pure friendships between men and women, but it was a feeling from experience. They wouldn't end it so easily.

At 10:40 AM, the high-speed train arrived.

It seemed that this carriage wasn't very crowded. After getting off, there were still quite a few people.

Shadow City's high-speed rail station was far outside the city, and it was not very big. This was understandable, as although it had a high-speed rail, the passenger flow wasn't high, so it was normal for it to be small.

Zoey and I traveled light, without any luggage, but the crowd was too dense. We were pushed to the back of the line, and it took half an hour to get out of the station.

Outside the station, there were low stone hills all around. Looking into the distance, the mountains were layered and towering, some even reaching the sky. It was winter, and I could see a patch of white on the mountain tops. I didn't know why, I felt a sense of pressure.

It was hard to imagine that in the mountains that separated the North from the South, there was a city hidden away, forgotten by the world.

Zoey excitedly waved her fists, ready to take a cab to the town where Bob lived. She said we had to wait for him and couldn't let him escape this time.

Today was a weekday, so Bob should be at work in the theater company. If we went to the town first, I'm worried something might go wrong.

Looking at the time, I decided to take Zoey to a nearby restaurant first and order some local specialties from Shadow City.

Back in college, our freshman and sophomore campus was actually in Shadow City, far from the main campus in Silverlight City. It was later merged. Sometimes on weekends, we would gather with classmates and often order some local dishes.

Small places had their limitations, but the food retained some original purity.

Zoey kept saying how delicious the food was, much better than the pre-made dishes in Silverlight City. She insisted on bringing Howard over to try it next time.

###chapter 99 Shadow City

After finishing lunch around twelve o'clock, I checked the address of the Shadow City Theater Troupe. It would take about 10 minutes by taxi and about 20 minutes on foot.

It was also lunchtime for Bob, and with so many people around, it wasn't a good time to investigate. It wasn't urgent to find him, so I decided to wait until the afternoon work hours.

Thinking of this, I discussed it with Zoey and we decided to walk over.

Although the campus for freshmen and sophomores was in Shadow City, it was far from the city center. The current high-speed rail station was on the east side, and the campus was on the west side. Every weekend and holiday, we would rush to take the bus home.

Shadow City was originally named Trade City. It was said that there used to be a Trade Mountain here. According to the legend, the god of trade came here and saw that the local people had no concept of trade, so he taught them. To commemorate him, the city was named Trade City.

In ancient times, a politician vigorously promoted reforms, fought against slave owners, seized land, emphasized agriculture, and developed military power. He redivided administrative regions, laying a solid foundation for future unification.

Later, the king made this place his fiefdom. Most ancient reformers met tragic ends, and this politician was no exception. His body was chopped into pieces, and his entire family was killed.

Memories turned into history over time, and history took on new forms as time went by.

For that reformer, it had been over 2,000 years. In the midst of history, his contributions and fate formed an inexplicable irony. He masked the brutality of that era with courage and idealism.

For our generation of students, the four years of college passed quickly. We didn't have time to look at this place, and it was soon forgotten. Years later, when we thought of it, it was just a small city.

This city had been abandoned by time for too long. There were very few new buildings on the streets. There were a few decent buildings to decorate the city's facade, but they looked out of place.

Turning a corner from the main road into an alley, there was a steel-welded iron gate with decorative statues on both sides, eroded by rain to the point of being almost unrecognizable. From a distance, we could see two symmetrical windows with marble-painted patterns.

Going deeper, there were signs of demolition, broken bricks and tiles scattered everywhere, collapsed mud walls, and dismantled stages.

The whole city gave me a strange sense of disconnection, as if time had been captured here, chopped into three pieces, displaying the corpses of history and time.

About ten minutes later, we arrived near the Shadow City Theater Troupe. According to the navigation, it should be here, but we couldn't find the location of the troupe. We wandered around for a long time, asking people for directions, and finally saw a sign for the "Shadow City Theater Troupe" on a three-story building in a nearby courtyard.

The white sign with black letters indicated that it was still under government jurisdiction, but the sign was rusty and mottled, making the words hard to read unless you got close.

"Is this... the Shadow City Theater Troupe?" Zoey looked up, glanced around, and asked in disbelief.

Indeed, the theater troupe in the neighboring Silverlight City was funded by the local government, with a building designed by a famous domestic architect. The whole building looked like a blooming mandala flower.

In contrast, Shadow City Theater Troupe was so dilapidated, with just a three-story building and a small courtyard. Compared to the Silverlight City Theater Troupe, it seemed very shabby, but considering the state of Shadow City, it was already quite good.

An old man was on duty in the duty room, who was thin, plainly dressed, wearing black-framed glasses, with gray hair. He was lying on a rocking chair with his eyes closed, resting. There was an ashtray full of cigarette butts, a dirty water cup, and an old-style player connected to Bluetooth, playing Schubert's serenade on a loop.

"The place is a bit shabby, but the artistic atmosphere here is much stronger than that of the Silverlight City Theater Troupe. If I were the leader, I would make those guys come here," Zoey hummed.

"Hello, is Bob Moore in the company?" I knocked on the window.

The old man on duty heard someone talking, responded unhappily, and opened his eyes, seemingly displeased at being woken up from his nap.

"What Moore?" The old man on duty blinked, looking confused as if he hadn't heard clearly.

"Bob Moore," I said.

"What Bob?" The old man on duty tilted his ear, squinting as if he had hearing problems.

He didn't want to answer. He was engrossed in the serenade from the speaker. How could he not hear me?

"Bob Moore!" Zoey couldn't help but shout, throwing her credentials on the table and glaring, "Sir, the police are handling a case. Please cooperate."

The old man on duty was stunned when he saw the police badge.

Seeing Zoey's smug and cunning look, I felt helpless. She had even taken Ruben's police badge.

Ruben was bold, lending such an important item. If something went wrong and we got caught, it wouldn't be a small matter.

But I had to admit, Zoey's trick worked. The old man's attitude immediately changed. He didn't even open the badge, straightened his back, and handed it back to Zoey with both hands. Zoey quickly put it back in her bag, afraid he might get suspicious.

"Miss, hello," the old man on duty greeted formally, then lowered his voice, "Did Bob sleep with someone's daughter again, and her parents went to the police? Are you here to arrest him? It can't be a minor, right? What a scoundrel!"

He spoke with a look of anguish.

Indeed, Bob hadn't changed at all over the years, always involved in romantic affairs, even the duty officer knew.

"It's not a minor, but the girl is determined to marry him. She attempted suicide with sleeping pills a few days ago. We're here to find Bob to mediate the situation, but please keep it confidential and don't reveal our identities," Zoey whispered mysteriously, lying effortlessly, a skill taught by Howard.

The old man on duty nodded vigorously with his eyes closed, then leaned out the window and shouted towards the third floor, "Bob! Bob! Someone's looking for you!"

No response.

He, seeing no answer, looked embarrassed, glanced at us awkwardly, swallowed, cleared his throat, and shouted, "Shadow City's contemporary young artist, soul dancer, the theater troupe's only dancer, someone's looking for you!"

###chapter 100 The Dancer

Zoey, who was sipping her coffee, choked on it, amused by the string of fancy titles.

She laughed so hard she could barely catch her breath.

The old man on duty looked embarrassed, touched his nose, and said with a smile, "He gave himself all those titles. Artists are like that, aren't they? They can't live without a bit of madness. It's normal for them to be a bit exaggerated."

I smiled knowingly. Bob hadn't changed a bit over the years.

In Back college, one of his labels was "charming," and the other was "flamboyant."

He was indeed very talented at dancing and often carried himself like an artist, frequently changing his titles-sometimes he was an artist, sometimes a dancer, sometimes a singer.

Alan was also helpless with this guy back then, always smiling whenever he mentioned Bob.

I remember when we started our junior year, everyone was busy with their own things, except for him, who was enthusiastically helping the freshmen. He spotted a freshman girl and shamelessly got her phone number. Just a few days into military training, he picked some wildflowers from the roadside and, in front of the whole school, knelt on one knee,

"I saw these flowers by the roadside, and were so beautiful, just like the day I met you by chance. In our brief encounter, you added a touch of vibrancy to my dull soul, and I came alive, placing all the beautiful things related to you in front of you, including myself."

"Darling, if this isn't love, then what is?"

On the day of his confession, Alan and I were dragged along as his cheering squad. Benjamin, who had asked me to help him win over Cindy, stood there, giving a thumbs-up and shouting, "Real man!" Alan and I turned and walked away, pretending we didn't know him.

As I was reminiscing, a voice came from the window, "Show the young ones how to dance Latin! Let them come up!"

"Get lost! Watch your behavior, or Shirley Reed will skin you alive!"

The old man on duty shouted back, pointing to the third floor, and said with a smile, "Just go up the stairs, and you'll find him in the dance studio on the third floor."

The stairwell was littered with cigarette butts, and the stairs were uneven, with exposed steel and concrete, clearly an old building in disrepair.

As I reached the third floor, I could already hear the music and the rhythm.

Turning left and pushing open the door, the noisy and crowded sounds rushed in like water from a balloon.

The scene was different from what I had imagined.

There were no young, pretty girls that Bob liked. The people watching the dance were at least in their fifties or sixties, dressed in flamboyant clothes, dancing with the front man, who was Bob.

Unlike his long-haired college days, Bob now had a pompadour hairstyle with a ponytail, wore gold-rimmed glasses, and looked a bit tired, but still had that flirtatious look from over a decade ago, with a stubbly beard.

He wore a tight red backless Latin top with a deep V-neck adorned with flowers, and tight black pants. His body had started to gain weight, making the outfit somewhat mismatched.

"Yes, very good, focus on the key points and use your waist strength. Turn! Wonderful, you are like twenty-year-old angels. My goodness, you are the most talented students I've ever taught!"

He was fully engrossed in leading the dance, seemingly unaware that the door had opened. His movements were precise and expressive, like a fully bloomed black rose on the edge of a cliff.

"Mrs. Smith, I have to say, he's quite good at dancing. I don't think the people at the Silverlight City drama troupe can compare."

Zoey whispered in my ear.

I nodded. Back in college, Alan was the best at scriptwriting, Laura was the star performer, and Frank and the later freshman Joseph were the best among the boys, though still a notch below Laura in artistry.

But when it came to dancing, Bob was the best among the students, even invited by professional dance clubs outside the school.

Because of this, Laura and Bob continued to develop in this field after graduation, though Laura had become a well-known artist in the state, while Bob remained relatively unknown, working in a small drama troupe in Shadow City.

After about ten minutes, the dance practice ended, and everyone applauded. Zoey and I also clapped.

Bob, in high spirits, gave lively and precise feedback, praising them to the point of giving them goosebumps, and lightly pointing out issues, making them laugh heartily.

Zoey listened with wide eyes, amazed, "He's really wasting his talent here."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"With his skills, quick thinking, and expressive ability, he could easily earn some certificates and open a dance school in Silverlight City. He'd make much more money than here."

Zoey had a point, but why didn't he?

I was curious too. With Bob's personality, he shouldn't be content with obscurity.

As I was thinking, Bob clapped his hands, concluding the practice, "Okay, that's it for today. Make sure to practice at home. Remember, dancing is an art, an expression, not a formulaic exercise. Enjoy it! Let's shout our slogan one last time."

"Latin Senior Group Champions! We are the champions!" everyone shouted.

Then they said their goodbyes, packed up, and left.

As the crowd thinned, Bob whistled at us, ran over, and smiled,

"Two ladies, you've come to the right place for Latin dance in Shadow City. I'm the dance instructor at the Shadow City drama troupe, a national Latin dance champion, and a certified national Latin dance judge. I can tell you, other so-called teachers are just amateurs pretending to be experts after a couple of days of dancing, just to scam money..."

"Bob, do you still recognize me?"

I interrupted his self-promotion, feeling a bit disappointed at how the once-spirited young man had turned out.

Bob was stunned, looking at me with a bit of confusion. His lips trembled slightly as if he was excited, but he quickly hid it, grinning exaggeratedly and laughing,

"Nancy! Mrs. Smith!"

He opened his arms and moved to hug Zoey.

Zoey backed away in fright, "No, I'm her student. Sir, please get a grip."

Bob touched his slicked-back pompadour hairstyle and said repeatedly, "Okay."

###chapter 101 The Strange Amnesia

"Nancy, what are you doing here?"

"Could it be that you like Latin dance? Am I that famous in Silverlight City? You're my classmate, and your apprentice is here too, so I'll give you a 20% discount. You don't look a day over thirty, really. Skincare products must be expensive, right? Alan is such a great guy, always taking care of his wife."

Bob beamed, sniffed, and made an exaggerated Latin dance move, cheerfully saying,

"Latin dance isn't that hard, it's just physical work."

I instinctively felt that Bob and Howard had a habit of talking to themselves. The two of them could chat all night without taking a break.

Bob was the most lively and talkative among us. Talking to him was exhausting because he never stayed on one topic for long. I remember when voice messaging first became popular in college, each voice message could be up to sixty seconds long. Bob could send over a dozen sixty-second messages in a row, and none of them were on point.

"On the night of November 10, 2024, what were you doing at the True Love Entertainment Club in Silverlight City? What happened after you went upstairs with Alan? Is Douglas's death related to you? Where is Alan now? Tell me."

I interrupted his endless chatter and got straight to the point.

"What's this, a detective game or something?"

Bob was stunned as if he didn't understand what I was saying at all.

"The old steel mill, child trafficking, the hellish days, Frank, Lally, Laura, Mike, Tom, do you remember? Don't you want to say something?"

Zoey couldn't stand Bob's feigned ignorance any longer and started naming names, using past pain to provoke him, almost like a harsh interrogation.

"What old steel mill? I know Frank, Laura, and Mike, and with Alan and me, we were the five closest friends in college. But who are Lally and Tom? I really don't know them."

Bob looked innocent.

What did this mean?

Was he still pretending to be ignorant at this point?

Or did I make a wrong judgment? Maybe Bob wasn't one of the kids from the old steel mill. After all, most of it was speculation so far. Tom, Lally, Frank, and Joseph's identities were confirmed.

No, I had seen the group photo of the kids from the old steel mill. The kids' appearances might change a bit after ten or twenty years, but their basic looks wouldn't change.

Ronald also mentioned that he recognized Bob and Mike waiting for Alan downstairs, which proved my guess about Bob's identity was correct.

Zoey walked over, took out a photo on her phone, and almost shoved it in his face, sternly asking,

"Don't you recognize these people? When you were in hell, someone was willing to abandon his family and status just to seek justice for you. You were pitiful, your fate was tragic, but what about him? He was not only a police officer but also a father and husband. Have you ever thought about his feelings? Should the harm the world caused you be returned in full?"

Bob's eyes flickered with doubt. He stared at the photo for a long time and slowly said, "He must have been an extraordinary police officer, but I'm sorry, I really don't know him."

"You don't recognize anyone in this photo?"

Bob nodded seriously and said, "No need to joke around. I only recognize Alan, Laura, Frank, and Mike."

He pointed them out but didn't know Lally and the others.

Looking at Bob's dazed expression, it didn't seem fake, but I had a bad feeling and asked, "Do you remember where you're from?"

"I don't remember. I don't know why I forgot or when I forgot. I can't remember things from my childhood. Alan knows about this too."

Bob, who had been full of energy just now, looked downcast and continued, "It's like a dream. I only remember my college life, which was very happy. Knowing you all was great."

I felt a stir in my heart and asked, "What did Alan say at the time?"

"Alan said if I don't remember, then I don't remember. Remembering too much wasn't good. He told me not to be nervous and to relax. He said it was a gift from fate."

Bob laughed self-deprecatingly, "What kind of gift is this? Is amnesia supposed to be happiness?"

"Maybe."

Every time we got close to the truth, the person who could reveal it would disappear. This time we finally found Bob, but he couldn't remember the past.

"On November 10, were you in Silverlight City or Shadow City?"

He might not remember his childhood, but he should remember what happened on the day of the True Love Entertainment Club murder case.

"I was at the company. That night, I drank a lot with some friends and went to bed early."

This matched up. When I called Bob, his girlfriend answered.

But what did his girlfriend mean by saying a man's words can't be fully trusted?

"I called you that day, and your girlfriend answered. Didn't she tell you?"

"Girlfriend?"

Bob responded loudly, his expression exaggerated. He blinked, and seemed particularly energized by this topic,

"Nancy, you know me. My longest relationship record is less than two months. How could I bring a girl to my house? If you don't believe me, come home with me and see. We can have dinner together, I'll cook."

Zoey snorted and looked at Bob with disdain. Just now, he was deep and thoughtful, but as soon as women were mentioned, he turned into this.

Bob was strange. Even though I had enough evidence to prove he was there that day, and possibly involved, his expression just now didn't seem fake.

He couldn't remember his childhood and seemed unaware of what happened on November 10, clearly stating what he did.

When I asked about his girlfriend, his reaction was even more exaggerated. He never had a relationship longer than two months. I almost forgot that Bob was a notorious playboy in college, famous for changing girlfriends quickly. He wouldn't bring a girl home or introduce her to friends.

So who was the woman who answered the phone?

Could Bob's memory issues be related to his experiences at the old steel mill?

If his memories of the old steel mill were completely gone, the incident must have happened after the big fire. Who was he with then? Were Frank, Laura, and Mike all together?

###chapter 102 The Female Neighbor

What's even more bizarre was that he knew almost nothing about what happened on the day of the incident.

What kind of amnesia was this?

He didn't seem to be faking it, and at that point, I didn't think there was any need to keep pretending.

These people must be in contact with each other secretly. From the start of the investigation, they knew the situation, so Bob must know too. Therefore, pretending to be crazy and dumb was obviously meaningless, especially with such a flawed act.

There must be something fishy here. Since we were here, we might as well visit their home.

I also wanted to know who the woman who answered the phone was.

Bob clapped his hands and regained his usual spirit, leading the way while humming a song, taking two steps forward and one step back, swaying his round buttocks, occasionally turning back with a charming smile, making people want to kick him.

"Mrs. Smith."

Zoey whispered in my ear.

"What?"

"Do you think he's really amnesiac or faking it?" Zoey asked.

"I'm not really sure either. It all seems a bit fishy. If he's really pretending to be crazy and dumb, then it's too flawed."

Zoey nodded, looking like she wanted to say something but stopped.

I looked at Bob swaying ahead, gritting my teeth in hatred. I remembered all the things about him from college. This guy had a terrible reputation among women in college. He once pursued a girl in our dorm, and within a week, he disappeared, leaving my roommate crying for a long time.

Because of this, I didn't have a good impression of Alan either, as he often hung out with Bob in the drama club. Birds of a feather flock together, which was the natural logic.

"Although it's a bit disrespectful, this is the first time I've seen such a flamboyant and cheap man."

Zoey glared at Bob with hatred.

"I don't deny it."

Bob, walking ahead, couldn't hear our discussion. He seemed to be in a very good mood today. When he reached the gatehouse, he ran over with small steps and did an exaggerated Latin dance move in front of the old man on duty, who cooperated by blowing a kiss.

Zoey shivered in disgust, her mouth twitching uncontrollably.

I couldn't stand it either and coughed lightly.

The old man on duty noticed us and quickly composed himself, greeting us with a smile, glancing at Bob,

"Leaving already?"

He probably thought we were taking Bob to the police station for investigation.

"David Bailey, don't guess wildly. This is my college friend's wife, and this is my college friend's wife's apprentice."

Bob put his arm around David's neck and said loudly, "The usual rule, if the boss checks, just say my dad is sick again, and I have to go back to take care of him."

Hearing this, I felt relieved. Another purpose of this trip was to see the informant Ronald had at the old steel mill.

Bob mentioned forgetting his childhood, and although I temporarily believed him, I still kept an eye out and didn't mention the informant, fearing that Bob might be pretending and would alert Frank and others if he knew about my findings.

When he mentioned his father being sick, it was probably referring to the informant.

"Today, the only dance artist in Shadow City will personally cook a meal for my classmate and my classmate's apprentice."

Bob said with a dramatic tone, holding his head high.

"Get lost. Don't go to the bar tonight. Last time Shirley came to the company to hit you, but I stopped her!"

Bob frowned and raised his voice, "What Shirley? How many times have I said she's not my girlfriend, just a female neighbor? Who knows what's wrong with her, always being overly attentive, knocking on my door at midnight. Do I look like someone who would just let anyone in?"

"You become less of a person when you're casual."

Zoey made a face and responded softly.

"One moment you say Shirley is your last woman, the next you say she's not your girlfriend. I have experience; a man eventually needs a wife. Think about it, you're not young anymore."

David spat and turned back to his small room, lying on the chair to rest.

Bob stood there, looking confused, "Am I that kind of person? I've been honest with girls all these years. If I like someone, I admit it. If I don't, I don't. Do I lack the courage to admit it?"

He looked at us indignantly, seeking some recognition.

I walked out expressionlessly, and Zoey walked over with a smile,

"Of course, you're not like that."

Bob beamed and nodded, "You have a keen eye!"

"Because you are, a scumbag!"

She quickly ran ahead of me, looking at Bob, afraid he would chase her.

Unexpectedly, Bob laughed and admitted openly,

"Scumbag is not wrong."

"He's invincible," Zoey commented.

"Zoey, did you notice?" I whispered.

"What?"

"That old man on duty, David, mentioned Shirley, saying she's Bob's girlfriend. He mentioned it again just now."

I reminded her.

"Yes, but didn't he deny it? Scumbags are usually like that, Mrs. Smith, you don't know..."

Zoey said indifferently.

I shook my head. Bob's playboy reputation was well-known in college, but it didn't mean he was irresponsible. He wouldn't date multiple women at the same time. If he liked someone, he admitted it. If he didn't, he didn't. He never hid his status. However, his emotional attention span was indeed quite short.

I briefly explained Bob's usual behavior to Zoey.

"So, Mrs. Smith, what do you mean?"

Zoey was also a bit confused.

"I mean, Bob shouldn't deny Shirley as his girlfriend, nor would he keep changing his story. David must be telling the truth, and Bob's words might not be entirely false either."

At that moment, Bob turned back to the window, chatting and laughing with David, showing no signs of guilt or pretense. He waved at me, signaling to wait a moment, and took a few hundred-dollar bills from David, putting them in his pocket skillfully, indicating he often borrowed money. Although Shadow City's economy wasn't great, a social institution job shouldn't be so financially tight.

"Mrs. Smith, I'm dizzy."

Zoey was even more confused.

Bob definitely had issues. Considering the old steel mill criminals' past abuse of children, I had a vague answer in my mind.

###chapter 103 The Person Stuck in Time

Not long after, Bob drove an old car quickly out of the yard and stopped in front of Zoey and me.

According to Zoey, she wouldn't be surprised if the car exploded the next second.

Bob opened the car door, wearing sunglasses he had found somewhere, and slid out of the car like a fish. He took small steps around to the front passenger door, carefully opened it, and made a very elegant inviting gesture.

"Doesn't he look like a secret agent in a movie, waiting for the boss to get in?"

Bob grinned, showing a sunny smile. The girls didn't care about his behavior now.

Sighing at how time spares no one, this guy couldn't keep up with the times.

"The boss usually sits in the back."

With that, Zoey and I sat in the back seat.

"Doesn't it really look like it? I designed this move for a long time, incorporating elements of dance. Can you feel the mysterious power of nature, the flowing water, the lion waking up from a nap and starting to hunt..."

Sitting in the driver's seat, Bob gestured wildly as he described his off-topic thoughts, occasionally turning his head, like a big boy.

At that moment, it felt like ten years ago when we had just left the college dorm, his endless chatter. He seemed unaware of his age, but having a good mindset was indeed a way to stay young. In this regard, Bob was exceptionally gifted. Where there were women, he was always young.

"Not at all. The way you wear sunglasses makes me think of a new direction for artificial intelligence self-driving technology."

Zoey said with a smile.

"What, expanding the space in the car to hold a grand ball inside? My God, girls with long hair wearing butterfly hair clips, dressed in formal shirts, black lace skirts, white long stockings, paired with black leather shoes, the breeze blowing, the skirt edges swaying! I feel like I was born for this moment!"

Zoey was stunned, turning her head to look at me incredulously as if asking how I knew such a strange person, and he was already a 35-year-old man.

"No, Mr. Moore, I meant that in the future, blind people could also drive AI cars themselves."

As soon as she said this, Zoey regretted it a bit. It wasn't humorous anymore; it was almost a personal attack.

Before Zoey could say anything, the "victim" Bob himself leaned on the steering wheel, laughing so hard he couldn't catch his breath. After a while, he calmed down and said,

"You have a talent for drama writing. How about I introduce you to a friend? My friend is very talented, an excellent playwright, with outstanding literary skills. Let me put it this way, he will definitely be the best playwright in the country in the future. No one can surpass him. By the way, he might even become a poet."

Zoey and I exchanged a glance, and Zoey finally realized something was wrong.

The way he spoke didn't sound like a man in his thirties but like someone in their twenties still in college. This tone wasn't about his youthful state, but he really seemed to think he was in his twenties.

Alan would definitely be the best playwright in the country in the future. Alan was about the same age as him. When he graduated, he had clearly stated that he considered writing as a hobby and didn't plan to pursue it as a career. Alan had also mentioned these things to Zoey.

Most importantly, "he will definitely be the best playwright in the country in the future" was Bob's evaluation of him in college, and his tone just now was passionate and articulate as if he was saying it for the first time.

"Bob, who are you introducing?"

I asked tentatively.

"Alan, of course. You've been together for so long, you know him better than I do. It seems only men truly understand men. You're studying law, how could you understand the soul of writing."

As Bob spoke, he stepped on the gas pedal, and the car jolted before starting to move forward slowly. The engine was loud, like a green train.

My heart trembled, further confirming my suspicions. I squeezed Zoey's hand, signaling her not to ask any more questions.

Along the way, Bob complained about the decline of Shadow City and how inconvenient life was. I didn't ask any more questions.

After about half an hour, the car left the city and drove for another ten minutes or so in a town not far from the city, stopping on a small street.

Next to the street was a row of four-story buildings. The first floor was storefronts, with some restaurants and shops, and the second, third, and fourth floors were residential. These small buildings usually had only two floors, but the foundations were dug four or five floors deep. When the area developed, the owners added two more floors, creating extra space that could be rented or sold for a good profit.

But the scene in front of me seemed familiar, but I couldn't recall it immediately.

Bob didn't get out of the car. He tossed the car keys to me, smiling, "The room on the right on the third floor. Go up and open the door yourself. It's not your first time here. I'm going to buy some groceries. Although I'm a master of kitchen arts, I can't cook out of thin air."

Zoey looked at me and then at Bob, already scared by the strange conversation.

"Bob."

I was a bit nervous, pursed my lips, and smiled, "My phone is dead. What time is it now?"

"Four-thirty in the afternoon." Bob glanced at his watch, "I guess I'll be back in a few minutes. The market isn't far from here."

"What month?"

"December, almost New Year's. Nancy, are you frozen silly?"

"What year?"

"2012."

With that, the car sped away.

"Mrs. Smith, what's wrong with Bob?"

Zoey's face was pale. She hadn't said much since noticing something was wrong in the car, especially when Bob talked to her. She stammered, clearly scared.

"He's stuck in time."

"Anyway, let's go to the third floor first. We still need one last piece of evidence. If it's true, then my guess is correct."

I said, holding Zoey's hand to comfort her, "Were you scared just now?"

Zoey nodded, thought for a moment, and then shook her head, "My dad said the more bizarre it is, the closer you are to the truth. That's a good thing."

"Your dad would be proud of you."

"Mrs. Smith, the last piece of evidence you mentioned, is it my dad's informant at the old steel mill?"

As they climbed the stairs, Zoey asked.

"Not entirely. It's another person. If this person is who I think she is, then Bob's problem can be solved."

###chapter 104 Multiple Personality Disorder

The stairway entrance of this small building was generally quite narrow, somewhat like the old building where Lally lived.

However, it was much more spacious than Lally's place, wide enough for two people to go up and down the stairs simultaneously without feeling crowded.

However, the structure of this type of building design also had its advantages. It was not a commercial apartment, so there was no need to consider shared areas. The structure of one staircase for two households meant that while the outside might be a bit cramped, the space inside the apartments was actually quite large. More space meant the homeowner could make more money when selling the property.

Roughly estimating, each unit in this building was about a little over 1,000 square feet, which was actually quite large. Without considering shared areas, in Silverlight City, it would be equivalent to a large unit of about 1,500 square feet.

On the third floor, there are two units. The one on the right was Bob's place, easily recognizable because it had a banner hanging that said, Dance Artist Bob.

The door on the left was very normal, cleaned very well, just an ordinary household.

As I was about to go up and knock on the door, the door to Bob's place opened, and a young girl in her twenties came out holding a bowl. She was wearing yellow cartoon pajamas, with long hair draped over her shoulders, and I could vaguely see some blue highlights, indicating she had dyed her hair, making her look quite young and fashionable.

The girl had delicate features and good skin, especially her eyes, which seemed to speak, blinking as she glanced at Zoey and me. She didn't pay much attention, thinking we were going to the fourth floor, and was about to enter the door on the left.

"Hello."

I greeted her to stop her.

The girl stopped, turned around, blinked, and pointed at herself, "Are you calling me?"

I nodded and smiled, "Are you Bob's girlfriend, Shirley?"

Hearing the term "Bob's girlfriend," the girl couldn't hide her joy and said happily, "Yes, what can I do for you?"

"We spoke on the phone in November."

Shirley was stunned for a moment, thinking carefully, but couldn't recall the event.

"Around November 12th."

I took out my phone and checked Bob's call records, "It was around 3 or 4 in the afternoon. I called Bob, and he was probably asleep, so you answered and asked who I was, and told me not to trust men too much."

"Do you remember now?" I asked.

"No, I didn't receive your call. You must have mistaken me for someone else. If there's nothing else, please leave."

After I finished speaking, Shirley's attitude changed drastically, becoming impatient. She held the bowl in one hand and took out a key from her pocket with the other, preparing to open the door.

"On November 10, 2024, Bob didn't go to work. He wasn't in Shadow City at all during those days; he was in Silverlight City, right?"

"When he came home, he didn't tell you where he had been but went straight to sleep. You became suspicious, so when you heard a woman's voice on the phone, you were particularly alert."

"You've already remembered me, but you instinctively think my arrival is not a good thing. You fear that your happy days with Bob might be numbered, so you want me to leave, right?"

Shirley stopped, and sneered, "Are you some kind of goddess of luck, here to spread hope and luck?"

"Perhaps," I said calmly.

"Get out!"

"How can you be so rude!" Zoey couldn't stand it anymore.

"If you can't stand it, then leave. No one forced you to come here. If you don't leave, I'll call the police!"

Shirley rolled her eyes.

"If your happiness is solely based on being with Bob, isn't your happiness a bit self-deceptive?"

I observed Shirley's expression as I spoke. This was my last attempt and the most important clue of the afternoon.

Sure enough, Shirley's expression became unnatural, as if someone had stolen something from her. Her eyes started to wander, and she stammered,

"What do you know? If love isn't about being together, is it still love?"

"You're right."

I agreed with her, nodding, and then asked, "So which Bob do you like? The silent and reserved Bob, or the youthful and vibrant Bob, forever stuck in his college days?"

Shirley's face changed dramatically, looking at me in disbelief as if she were seeing a ghost.

I sighed, realizing I had guessed correctly.

"How long has this been going on? When did you and he get together?"

"You... you... who are you? What nonsense are you talking about? I don't understand what you're saying! Leave here immediately!"

Shirley instinctively took two steps back, her speech becoming incoherent.

"If this continues without intervention, he might soon become three Bobs, one with complete memories, one with college memories, and one as the so-called dance artist of Shadow City. Currently, it seems the college memories and Shadow City memories are starting to mix."

"If this goes on... he might eventually take extreme measures, possibly forgetting everything or even choosing suicide due to the mental pressure. You should be well aware of his current state and what illness he has."

"Schizophrenia, or multiple personality disorder."

As soon as I finished speaking, the bowl in Shirley's hand fell to the ground, shattering into pieces and scattering the remaining food.

Bob's place on the right was neatly organized, with the walls covered in paintings, all replicas bought online, including works by Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso, and others. This matched Bob's college interests. Someone once asked him where his dance inspiration came from, and Bob seriously said that he had seen a painting as a child and felt the lines were dynamic and graceful, with a unique rhythm, just like the movements of the body.

By the balcony, an old man sat in a wheelchair, basking in the sun. He had his back to us since we entered and seemed not to hear any sound.

It seemed he was the informant Ronald had mentioned from the old steel mill, who had been living with Bob ever since.

Shirley walked over, patted the old man's shoulder, and slowly whispered a few words in his ear, gesturing towards us, indicating that guests had arrived, friends of Bob, and asked him to sit for a while.

The old man nodded, continuing to bask in the sun, never turning around.

"Cedric Murphy had a severe stroke before. He used to be unable to speak but could hear others. Recently, even hearing has become difficult."

Shirley explained.

Ronald's information was correct. The informant was indeed ill, unable to speak, and seemed to have difficulty moving. How to question him became a big problem, and we needed to find someone to quickly ask about the past.

For now, it seemed only Bob and Shirley could help.

###chapter 105 Awakening

Shirley said that she and Bob have been together for three years.

Her home was in Shadow City. After graduating from college, she started teaching art and dance at a local elementary school. She met Bob by chance when the school's art teacher was exchanging ideas with the Shadow City Drama Troupe.

Witty, humorous, optimistic, versatile, friendly in dancing, such an excellent young man like Bob, which girl wouldn't like him?

But this time Bob was different from before. His previous relationships never lasted more than two months. This time with Shirley, it seemed like he had settled down and wanted to live a good life together.

Shirley said Bob had told her about his past. He had many girlfriends in college, but he didn't know why he would forget them from time to time as if he never knew them. He tried hard to remember them, but looking back, it seemed like it wasn't him dating them, but someone else.

At first, Shirley simply thought Bob was telling her a joke, so she listened as if it were a story. Bob said she was the first girl he hadn't completely forgotten, maybe it was luck brought by God, and he wanted to cherish it.

For Shirley at that time, it was a romantic expression.

But to me, it was a deeply emotional and unforgettable feeling, truly unforgettable. I understood why Bob kept changing girlfriends. It might be one personality at one moment and another at another moment, intersecting with each other. The memories between the two personalities wouldn't be shared, or even completely forgotten, so naturally, changing girlfriends quickly made sense.

Shirley said she gradually noticed something was wrong in the past two years. One day Bob came home, and she was lying on the bed, which startled Bob. Bob said he didn't know her and asked why she was lying on his bed. That time it caused a big commotion, even calling the police.

The next day, Bob returned to normal and called Shirley to ask where she had gone. At first, she was very angry, thinking the man had changed his heart or something.

After two or three times, Shirley understood that it wasn't Bob's fault, but his mental state had a problem. He had two personalities, one was the Bob who wanted to stay with her in Shadow City for the rest of his life, and the other was the Bob who was crazy in college, living in the past.

Finally, one day, Bob proposed to break up, saying he couldn't harm Shirley anymore. As a result, Shirley rented the house opposite Bob's.

"When you don't remember me, I am your neighbor. When you remember me, I am your lover. I will always be with you."

This was what Shirley said to Bob.

From November 8th to 11th, Bob was missing for three whole days. Shirley couldn't reach him by phone and searched all over Shadow City but couldn't find him. During that time, the drama troupe went to other cities to perform. David thought Bob went out to find women, and Shirley came to question him, making excuses for him repeatedly.

On the morning of the 12th, Bob returned home and slept on Shirley's bed for a whole day and night.

I called in the middle, and Shirley thought it was one of Bob's ex-girlfriends calling, so she made an excuse and said that men's words couldn't be fully trusted, telling me to stop thinking about contacting Bob.

Shirley asked Bob where he had been these days, but Bob didn't say, only mentioning that he had finished dealing with past matters, everything would be fine, and he was back. Shirley didn't want to continue arguing.

But unexpectedly, the condition worsened. Bob didn't want to talk to her for more than a week, and there were intertwined and confused memories between the two personalities, vaguely indicating a third personality.

At this point, Shirley realized the seriousness of the situation and started consulting doctors for treatment plans. But unless the patient came in person, how could the doctor know the specific condition just from someone else's description? Bob's identity had been switching for more than a week, and the normal Bob hadn't returned.

Then I came.

Shirley's explanation was complete. According to what Shirley said, Bob must have been present on the day of the True Love Entertainment Club incident, and he saw Alan with Mike. Moreover, it wasn't just that day; Shirley also mentioned that Bob had been missing since November 8th.

In other words, the preparation for this case might have started two days earlier.

Could it be that during this time, they contacted Alan, and Alan also noticed something unusual?

I mentioned the names of Frank and others, but Shirley said she hadn't heard of them. It seemed Bob hadn't mentioned anything about his past.

As for Bob's split personality, I estimated it might have started when he was very young, possibly after seeing or experiencing something at the old steel mill, leaving a psychological trauma. At that time, the symptoms of split personality were not obvious and might have appeared only occasionally over a long period.

In college, it only manifested as memory lapses in relationships, while everything else was normal.

But after graduating from college, in these few years, the condition suddenly worsened, and the degree of split personality accelerated, even vaguely indicating a third personality.

What happened during this time? Why did the condition worsen so quickly?

With Bob's dancing skills, as Zoey said, he was one of the best in the Silverlight City Drama Troupe. Why did he come to Shadow City? Even if Frank had been planning this, wouldn't it be more convenient to stay closer for contact and practice? Why come here?

There was only one possibility, something might be left here, or he left Silverlight City voluntarily to seek refuge. Otherwise, a young man with a bright future wouldn't come to the poorest city in the state.

I looked up at the old man basking in the sun. Could it be him?

He was Ronald's informant, holding many secrets about the old steel mill and the deteriorating relationships between Laura, Frank, and others. If he stayed in Silverlight City, he might not have survived until now.

Or there was another possibility, Frank arranged for Bob to do something here.

But with Bob's current state, he didn't remember anything from the past, only his college life. Asking him would be a waste of time.

While I was racking my brain to eliminate various possibilities, Shirley's phone rang. As soon as the call ended, Shirley rushed out of the room in a flash.

Zoey and I sensed something was wrong and quickly followed, asking what had happened.

"Bob fainted at the Farmers' Market. The police called me to go to the hospital."

"Why did he faint? Was he beaten?"

"No."

Shirley said with a bitter expression, "He argued with the vendor. One said it was 2012, and the other said it was 2024. Upon hearing the news, Bob fainted on the spot."

###chapter 106 No Applause

Bob fell.

He was holding a fish in his arms.

He fainted in a murky puddle at the Farmers' Market, surrounded by onlookers.

The fish in his arms had bright eyes, its mouth opening and closing, its tail instinctively flapping, making its last struggle.

No one called an ambulance, not because of social norms or empathy, but because they were still in shock and hadn't reacted yet.

About ten minutes earlier, Bob argued with the fish vendor.

The vendor was watching short videos on his phone and had just seen a news report that started with, "Local time, December 22, 2024, at 3 PM."

Bob heard this and came over, saying it was 2012, so how could there be news from 2024?

Before the vendor could say anything, Bob suddenly started crying and asked the vendor, "Why do you keep the fish trapped in the tank?"

The vendor thought he was joking and said, "If I don't sell the fish, how will I make money? The fish stay fresh in the tank. Dead fish aren't worth as much. How many do you want?"

Bob went crazy, grabbed a fish, and ran outside, shouting that he was going to call the police and that someone was going to die.

He cried hysterically, telling every passerby that there was a den of child traffickers ahead, a hell on earth, and begged them not to go there.

The Farmers' Market was dirty and chaotic, with uneven ground and puddles everywhere, like a big pool.

He stopped in front of a murky puddle, ignoring the onlookers and the fish vendor chasing him. He closed his eyes and fell straight to the ground.

"If I want freedom, I must first have the courage to face death."

Saying this, he fell into the puddle, hit his head on the ground, and passed out.

Many people at the Farmers' Market knew him, not because he was excellent, but because he was flamboyant and high-profile, unlike most people. For example, when he heard a piece of music at the Farmers' Market, he would start dancing gracefully, ending with applause and bowing in a dirty environment filled with rotten eggs and vegetable leaves.

He would announce loudly in the crowd that he was the best dance artist in Shadow City, a dancer, a genius born to dance.

No one truly applauded him, thinking he was a desperate internet celebrity. His graceful dance was no longer the visual focus; people looked past him, constantly searching for hidden cameras, wondering who was directing this short drama.

He would see a child and chase after the parents, asking if their child needed to learn dance, claiming he was a genius and the best choice. The parents would avoid him like the plague.

No one truly applauded him. He was a madman, a fool, an idiot who didn't know the hardships of life.

"Are you an idiot? Young man, there are better things to learn. Attention-seeking behavior won't last. You're not young anymore; why not find a stable job?"

People were used to advising others, under the guise of being helpful, while engaging in despicable acts to satisfy their dirty vanity. Their sincere advice masked their true intentions, and when they encountered the weak, their first thought was to step on them.

No one truly applauded him. Older women who wanted to learn to dance invited him to be their coach. He gladly went, not charging a penny, and returned home with a basket of eggs, staring blankly in the kitchen.

This world never lacked embellishment and praise for kindness, but it had no interest in exploring the true meaning of the words themselves.

The hospital in Shadow City was not as good as the one in Silverlight City. As the locals said, if you caught a cold and went to the hospital in Shadow City, it's one thing; but if you have a serious illness, going to the hospital was no different from staying at home and counting your heartbeats.

This was obviously an exaggeration, but it was based on actual feedback.

In the dimly lit corner of the hospital corridor, Shirley was on the phone, arguing fiercely. From her stiff tone, it seemed she was arguing with her family. She wanted to discuss borrowing some money to take Bob to a better hospital in another city for treatment.

Suddenly, she threw her phone to the ground with great force, scattering the parts everywhere.

Shirley lit a cigarette and leaned weakly against the wall, and the smoke slowly rose and dissipated in the darkness. She stared blankly ahead.

"Mrs. Smith, my mom knows some overseas psychiatrists who might be able to help."

Zoey said softly at the end of the hallway.

I sighed and said quietly, "Let's see how things go after we handle this. Let's go back and let her be alone for a while."

Zoey didn't say anything else. She knew that Bob was likely directly involved in the Entertainment Club murder case. He might have less responsibility due to his schizophrenia, but the law would eventually catch up with him.

Bob had a bandage on his head from a minor injury he got in the afternoon. He had been awake for a while, sitting silently on the hospital bed.

Shirley, worried, had him undergo a series of CT scans. The doctor said there was no major issue, but mental illnesses couldn't be detected by CT scans. They needed to be diagnosed through the patient's medical history, clinical features, and psychological tests.

"Do you want to say something?"

I handed Bob a cup of water and sat in the chair by the bed.

His lips were dry, his eyes vacant. He blinked, opened his mouth, but said nothing.

The Bob I saw at noon was energetic and passionate, just like the confident and sunny person he was in college. Now, he looked like a withered rose past its prime, with a terrible complexion and lifeless eyes, like a middle-aged man who had seen better days.

Which one was the real him? I couldn't tell. I just suddenly felt that if he could stay in his happiest memories forever, it might not be a bad thing for people like him.

"Do you remember what happened at noon?"

I asked.

Bob nodded.

"Bob, I'm really happy to see you. You always have a special aura, sunny, confident, with a pure love for dance that many people can't have. You make me a bit envious, even jealous... Even if I later sensed something was off, I mean, if I had gone through the old steel mill incident, I wouldn't have handled it as well as you did."

If it were someone else, saying this might sound sarcastic. But if you knew Bob's past, you'd understand that being immersed in dreams forever might not be a bad thing. The past was too dark, and this wasn't about escaping. Ordinary people lived ordinary lives, and the lofty ideals of morality were just empty talk.

He glanced at me, showing a hint of surprise and fear. His instinctive reaction was to avoid eye contact, like a frightened child, shrinking back unconsciously.

###chapter 107 A Child Used for Drug Testing

If your secret was discovered by someone else, what would be your reaction in the next second?

I had never seen Bob with such an expression.

He shrank back forcefully, tightening the quilt in his arms, and then looked at me with a pleading gaze. He seemed to want to smile, using the most natural expression to buffer his inner emotions or perhaps to hide once more in front of me.

He kept struggling, with no way to retreat, as behind him was a hard wall and an iron bed frame.

In the end, he closed his eyes and collapsed powerlessly onto the bed, taking a deep breath. A sorrowful, heavy sigh escaped him, like the autumn wind causing flowers to wither, like time leaving no trace, turning hair white overnight. That kind of withered emotion had no vitality at all.

"You know?"

I looked at his haggard expression, not knowing how to respond for a moment, and slowly nodded.

Bob looked up at the slightly dim light above the hospital bed. The white ceiling light now appeared somewhat yellowish, with large black spots on it, which upon closer inspection were the accumulated corpses of light-attracted insects. He stared at it blankly for a while, a flash of despair passing through his hollow eyes.

"No need to be so cautious, I was just startled earlier. Based on my experience, this normal state should last for a while, and I won't suddenly revert to my past self."

Bob gave a bitter smile, looked at me, and said softly,

"Nancy, long time no see."

"Long time no see," I responded with a smile.

Even though we had met at noon, it felt like a long time since we last saw each other. This unique way of greeting made Zoey chuckle and stick out her tongue,

"Good evening, Mr. Moore."

Bob stared at Zoey for a long time, the fear quickly fading, and nodded, "Hello, Zoey."

"Mr. Moore, do you remember what happened at noon?"

Zoey asked in surprise, and even I couldn't help but become curious. Normally, people with schizophrenia or multiple personalities didn't know what their other self did, meaning they have no memory of it. However, a small number might have some vague memories.

"A little bit, like a dream. I can hardly distinguish between illusion and reality anymore. My brain is extremely exhausted, yet it seems to subconsciously know my state. This extreme split of self will eventually cause my brain to explode."

Bob explained, taking a sip from his cup and looking at it softly,

"Sometimes, I feel like my life is like the water in this cup. I used to comfort myself by thinking that having two of me meant my life was extended, but it made me very tired. I foolishly divided the water in the cup into two halves, and even spilled half of it in the process."

He gave a bitter smile, pressing the cup against his face, quietly feeling the temperature.

"Even in such a miserable state, I still quietly feel the warmth of life. Even if I die tomorrow, though I can't control it, there is still something good. I can still enjoy a moment of peace, and I still have Shirley... that silly girl, who pretends to be strong even though she's a crybaby. I've seen many girls like that, but why can't I forget her?"

"When you meet someone you truly love, you naturally won't forget her. It won't be affected by your state or controlled by illness. You'll subconsciously remember, like breathing."

I comforted him gently.

"An excellent metaphor. If I remember correctly, it was Alan's first play script in college. His writing was still very immature back then. So, you're here to ask about Alan, right?"

Bob tilted his head and smiled as if he had returned to his confident and relaxed state. But the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes and the visible fatigue betrayed him, revealing the unbearable burden and memories.

"When did this situation start? Shirley said it wasn't this severe before. Did it worsen after graduation in Shadow City? Why didn't you stay in Silverlight City back then?"

The true culprit of the True Love Entertainment Club murder case could be narrowed down to these people. Alan's whereabouts must be known by them, but I wasn't in a hurry to ask directly.

Firstly, I was still cautious, worried that Bob might intentionally hide something. Secondly, I wanted to know what happened after graduation, what happened after they left the old steel mill.

Thirdly, Bob was the closest to Alan among their group in college. Because Bob pursued my roommate, I knew Bob even before I met Alan.

Bob half-lay down, pulling the quilt closer to himself, changing to a more comfortable position, and sighed.

"I've been at the old steel mill since I can remember. Darkness, dampness, cold, hunger, and beatings filled my childhood. I saw children beaten to death and thrown off the cliff like garbage. I was so scared, not knowing when it would be my turn. What would I do then? Run? That would only make me die faster."

"I even thought, as long as I could die comfortably, without pain, that would be good."

Bob blinked, shivering slightly under the quilt, his pupils showing instinctive panic. He swallowed and continued.

"One day, I came up with a plan. I pretended nothing had happened, desperately trying to forget the bad things. That way, I would be the happiest child in the world. Living each day happily was still a day and living in constant fear was also a day. But I found I couldn't do it. I was still very scared. Nowadays, they call it an emotional outlet."

"So, I came up with another plan. I spent half my time being happy and half my time being scared. I wanted to give myself a chance to breathe. It worked pretty well. I was in a much better state than before. Over time, I found that this state was beyond my control. I started to forget things often, my emotions were unstable. One minute I was happy, the next I was crying."

"This was my luck, I guess. They thought I was crazy, so I wasn't chosen for drug testing on children because they couldn't see the effects. I wasn't chosen for blood draws or organ sales either. They said I was a fool, and if I infected others, they would have to deal with it."

"I was uncontrollably crazy, with a dog chain around my neck, tied to the door. The children beat and bullied me, venting all their fear, hatred, and disgust on me. I slept in the mud, drank rainwater, ate mud, and even foolishly drank their urine. I vaguely had a sense that death was the only relief, death was happiness. I wanted to die so badly. It was too painful. I was constantly splitting, unable to remember the morning or forgetting the night, the two of me constantly entangled."

"Until that day, I realized that when I developed the consciousness of two selves, I had already become their test subject."

Bob gave a bitter laugh, looking at me,

"Yes, I was a child used for drug testing, for psychiatric drugs."

###chapter 108 Fangs

Bob was afraid of being beaten, afraid of being used as a test subject, and afraid of being thrown away like garbage after he died.

Such a young child, and he was already thinking that it would be better if death was painless and had no hope for life at all.

He had thought about living, just living, tried to adjust his mindset, and attempted to avoid one crisis after another, but in the end, he still got caught.

Who was behind all this, making these children test drugs, even psychiatric drugs? To ensure the stability of the drug's effects and better observe reactions, drugs were added without the children's knowledge.

What kind of people were these criminals? They were so shrewd and experienced that they could easily spot which children were on the verge of a mental breakdown, and they found Bob easily.

"Alan told me about this. He said I wasn't sick but had taken some weird drugs. As long as I stopped taking those drugs, I would get better. You should know that Alan and the rest of us have known each other since we were kids."

"Frank has always been in contact with you guys?"

I asked.

"That's right. Later, Frank kept in touch with us, but not Alan. We didn't include him in our plans; instead, we deliberately weakened our relationship with him, gradually reducing contact. Even if he called, I wouldn't answer. No matter how good a friend is, if you don't keep in touch for a long time, the relationship will fade. That's what I thought."

"Why?"

I understood why the few of them who were close in college hadn't kept in touch. I had thought it was because they were busy with work and had their own lives to live, but it turned out they had deliberately distanced themselves from Alan.

"Couldn't bear it."

Bob said succinctly, then paused and added.

"He was like the protagonist in a TV show, always able to turn danger into safety. His luck was so good, but it didn't make people jealous; it seemed like it was meant to be. Do you know how Alan saved me?"

I shook my head. I noticed that whenever these people mentioned Alan, they couldn't stop talking, constantly describing him. Psychologically, this was a form of compensatory description. When you hold something in high esteem or love it deeply, your subconscious mind felt that a simple description was too perfunctory, so you added a lot of extra details and embellishments.

"He secretly threw away the food I was supposed to eat every day and gave me all his food. He was just a few years old at the time, starving for several days. I couldn't stand it anymore and he secretly went out to beg for food, occasionally bringing some back for me."

"Was it Sand Village?"

I asked. At this point, the reason Alan went out to beg for food in Sand Village became clear.

"Yes." Bob nodded. "There were many children on psychiatric drugs at that time. I was the worst off. Alan told them to throw away their food and then secretly crawled out through a hole in the backyard to find food for them."

At that point, a smile appeared on Bob's face.

"Good people get good rewards. Alan met the Thompson family in Sand Village. George helped him escape. Before leaving, Alan said he would get us all out. Looking back now, how could that be possible? So many children, how could Alan get us all out? But I believed it, I still believe it now. Many children believed it, even chanting before they died that Alan would come to save them. Alan gave us hope to live. Not long after, Tom was taken out."

Bob's eyes were full of light, and he smiled.

"Tom was so happy when he left. He was sold, and before he left, he had a full meal. He said it was Alan who helped him. He had already lost an eye. We weren't jealous; on the contrary, we were probably happier than Tom himself because we were not only happy for him but also saw hope. Yes, Alan was right. He could definitely get us all out!"

At this point, I sighed. Not long after Tom left, George passed away.

The old steel mill discovered that George had started investigating them, so they took action decisively. They had a little girl lure George to the old steel mill that night, and a fire destroyed all the evidence and memories.

"In reality, we were too naive. The evil in this world doesn't exist without reason. Its existence is predicated on the absence of justice. We never thought about why the old steel mill was never discovered by others, why no one came to save us."

Bob said dejectedly, his eyes glancing at Zoey sitting next to me. This small action might have gone unnoticed by Zoey, but I caught it keenly.

When he recovered, from the first moment he saw Zoey, his eyes were not right, as if with a kind of fear. At first, I thought it was because he had just switched from one personality to another and was a bit unstable, but when Bob mentioned that no one came to save them, his eyes glanced at Zoey again.

He was afraid, and apprehensive, maybe because Zoey reminded him of something familiar. I suddenly remembered that Zoey said she looked like her mother, but her mother's eyes weren't as beautiful, so her eyes took after her father. I recalled Ronald, who was disguised as a street vendor near the Entertainment Club. Although he looked very tired in recent years, with very rough skin, those eyes were indeed very spirited.

But why was Bob so afraid of Ronald?

When I thought of Ronald at this moment, an inexplicable fear and dread arose from the bottom of my heart, and I couldn't help but shiver.

Bob also noticed my reaction, his face changed, and he stared at me, saying seriously,

"Have you met him?"

"Who?"

My face was very uneasy, and I asked back, glancing at Zoey beside me. I knew what Bob wanted to ask, but Zoey was right next to me. She wasn't very clear about this matter yet, especially Ronald's role in the whole case and his relationship with these children. But to what extent she knew, I wasn't sure.

So I quickly hinted to Bob to stop talking.

"Who is he?"

Zoey, who had been listening to Bob's story, stopped and turned to ask me, stunned.

"Is it Frank?"

"Yes." I glossed over it, finding an excuse, "Zoey, it's already evening, and I just remembered we haven't eaten yet. How about we go get something to eat and bring some back for Bob and Shirley?"

"Mrs. Smith, I can go down."

Zoey said, standing up and preparing to leave. After a few steps, she seemed to remember something, glanced at Bob, and then whispered in my ear a bit awkwardly.

"Mrs. Smith... can you transfer me some money? My mom froze my card."

###chapter 109 Disguise

"Zoey isn't here right now, what do you want to say?"

I asked, as Bob's expression earlier had already confirmed that he had something to say.

"Have you ever thought about why the old steel mill, although abandoned, isn't a place that no one manages? Why hasn't anyone discovered it for so long?"

Bob glanced in the direction of the hospital room door a couple of times, making sure Zoey wasn't around, then leaned in and lowered his voice.

"I found out that True Love Entertainment Club is the site of the old steel mill. But before that, I had come to the Entertainment Club to investigate Tammy and Lally. The location here is very good, the fork in the road leading to the Entertainment Club seems like it was built specifically for it. The background of the boss behind the Entertainment Club must be very significant."

I recalled seriously.

"That's right, keep talking."

Bob didn't say much, just let me continue.

I stared at Bob, and said seriously,

"I want you to tell the truth, is Douglas's death related to you? During the planning and execution stages by Frank, were you, Lally, Tammy, Tony, Tom, Mike, and Joseph deeply involved, or were you just witnesses?"

Bob's face turned heavy, he shook his head with a bitter smile, and sighed,

"It doesn't matter... everyone will die sooner or later, but I don't want you to be used as a pawn."

"What do you mean?" I vaguely felt something was wrong.

"After you investigated Tammy, Lally, Frank, Tony, and Tom, who gave you the clue to come to Shadow City to find me?"

Bob rubbed his face, took a deep breath, and said,

"It was that cop, right? The righteous cop. Zoey's eyes are so much like his, I noticed it at first glance. That look in his eyes from my memory, it's terrifying... If I'm not mistaken, Zoey should be his daughter. I don't know why her last name is Taylor, but it all seems arranged. The bad things the father did, let the daughter investigate, it's the most fitting punishment."

I suddenly stood up, looking at Bob in disbelief!

Ronald?

His eyes were red, and tears streamed down his cheeks, but the corners of his mouth turned up, and the curve gradually widened. He opened his mouth and laughed, with a hint of glee, a sense of narrowly escaping death. Gradually, there was a bit of arrogance and madness in his laughter!

"Bob, the Entertainment Club murder case is related to you, don't think..."

I looked at him in disbelief, I couldn't believe, or dare not believe, that Ronald was involved in all this. I had just seen him a few days ago, his patience, persistence, demeanor, and what Howard told me, most importantly, he was Zoey's father!

I never doubted him.

"What do you think? Why is the old steel mill like hell on earth, why hasn't anyone discovered such a damned place, how big of a protection umbrella is behind it to make the police ignore it?"

"He said he discovered it by accident..."

I widened my eyes, muttering; I thought of another possibility.

"Discovered by accident? Is there such a coincidence? Silverlight City is so big, there are so many police, and he just happened to discover it?"

Bob sneered repeatedly, his eyes flashing with hatred, muttering,

"You probably don't know, the old steel mill was originally under his jurisdiction. If he didn't report it, who would discover it? Do you think George didn't report it? When the police went there, there was nothing, no evidence left, why... think about it?"

"Because he tipped off the old steel mill, Nancy! He was lying from the beginning, this man would stop at nothing for a promotion. Why was George discovered by the people at the old steel mill? Because it was all his setup, he approached George as a cop, let that bastard Douglas contact Sand Village... it was all him! It was him!"

Bob almost screamed hysterically.

"What justice, what a bastard cop, what dignity does he have to say he represents justice? He's just a power-hungry, status-obsessed bastard! George died, the old steel mill was gone, and the kids who could run all ran. When Alan and Tom came over, there was nothing left, just ruins."

Ronald had close ties with the people at the old steel mill.

I couldn't believe it, or rather, without sufficient evidence, it was hard for me to determine Ronald's actions, even if Bob in front of me said it. But strictly speaking, Bob was a mental patient, should I believe him?

Bob looked at my indecisive eyes and smiled miserably.

"Nancy, Alan went to Sand Village, Tom followed, and later the old steel mill set up George to be killed. Do you know where we kids went after the fire?"

Ronald had mentioned to me that after the fire, many kids disappeared, and the ones he could find were sent to nearby orphanages and welfare homes.

"Let me guess, if I were Ronald, how would I say it to establish a righteous cop image in front of you."

Bob's eyes filled with tears, he looked up pretending to think, responded, and sneered,

"He would definitely say many orphans disappeared, he couldn't let George down, couldn't let those poor kids down, he would spare no effort to find them and send them to orphanages and welfare homes, right? The records of these institutions are very strictly sealed; even if you look for them, you won't find much. And you don't know their exact names, over twenty years, so many kids in and out of orphanages, you can't find them."

I was stunned and nodded.

"Yes, he did a good deed, he indeed sent some kids to the orphanage, but soon, those kids all died, because the ones sent were already failed drug test subjects or kids whose organs were removed and were dying. At that time, the newspaper even praised Ronald, but the case itself was different. He perfectly hid all the key clues, just turned this case into rescuing unidentified homeless children, and even after the kids died, he pretended to mourn them."

"No one knew, Ronald had been in the police force for less than two years at that time, and because of this, he was promoted to team leader."

Saying this, Bob spat heavily, disdainfully.

"That fire, Laura, Joseph, Frank, Mike, and I ran out. We didn't expect him to be waiting at the intersection, smoking. He seemed to know we would come this way. I'll never forget that scene. Thinking about it now, he was only in his twenties, covered in blood, blood dripping from his clothes and hair, and Douglas was sitting on a few heads, smiling and giving Ronald a massage."

"Douglas?"

Wasn't Douglas the one who betrayed these kids, how did he get involved with Ronald?

###chapter 110 The Cause of George's Death

"He is inherently a bad person. It was he who secretly drugged Joseph. To save himself from disaster, he sold out other children to have their organs removed. He even sold Tom, resulting in Tom losing an eye. Frank's current condition is also because he volunteered Frank for drug testing, claiming Frank had a good body... But we never expected that this bastard's schemes would go this far. He was Ronald's inside man, selling out everyone at the old steel mill!"

"Who would have thought that a seven or eight-year-old child could sit on a pile of corpses, unfazed, and even smiling? And all of this was explained by one sentence from Ronald."

Bob roared with infinite hatred, so angry that he began to cry uncontrollably.

"What did he say?"

"I avenged you all. From now on, you are my people!"

Avenge... Avenge what?

Did it mean that Ronald took advantage of the fire at the old steel mill, colluding with Douglas to kill all the involved personnel?

What Bob just expressed was that Ronald knew about the old steel mill's activities but didn't report them, acting as an accomplice. To prevent the mill's secrets from leaking, he even killed George, making it seem like he did it to take all the credit for himself.

But why did he personally kill these people?

It didn't make sense. After the fire, Ronald personally killed the head of the old steel mill and told the children he avenged them. Why? If he was obsessed with power and status, wouldn't this be a better opportunity to showcase his abilities?

Imagine if this case were exposed, Ronald would undoubtedly be hailed as a hero in the police force. Such a big case would have a significant impact, and it would be a great achievement on his record, likely leading to a higher position than just a squad leader.

I suddenly thought, could the fire itself have been Ronald's plan?

Because he knew that such a meticulous plan, once it had a small flaw, would be like a sandbag with a hole. As the sand leaked out, the hole would get bigger and bigger, and eventually, the sand would pour out like a waterfall, burying him.

He chose to replace the sandbag when it started to crack, discarding all the original sand.

In other words, Douglas's visit to Sand Village was likely arranged by Ronald, and the girl George adopted was also arranged by Ronald.

I recalled carefully that Ronald said there was an informant in the old steel mill who passed information to him. He kept hinting that Alan might be with Bob. This informant knew who the girl George adopted was. The only purpose was to make me come to find Bob or that former informant.

If I'm not mistaken that informant who was possible to hold crucial evidence against Ronald. Ronald couldn't go himself, so he sent me.

I asked. "Bob, the old man Cedric in your house, he's not your biological father, is he?"

Bob responded. "No, he was the only cook at the old steel mill and the only good person there. If it weren't for him, we kids might have died long ago. I was grateful for his help, so after graduating from college and getting a job, I took care of him."

"What is his relationship with Ronald?"

This was the key question and my last test. If Bob lied about this, it would prove that everything he said was a setup to complicate the case.

If Bob knew about Cedric's relationship with Ronald, it would mean Bob was telling the truth. The relationship between me, Bob, and Ronald would be that I communicated with both of them, but Ronald and Bob had no direct contact.

Otherwise, Ronald wouldn't have hinted for me to find this person.

"He was Ronald's informant. He thought Ronald, as a cop, could save these poor kids. Little did he know, Ronald was just using him to monitor the other members of the old steel mill and report their every move."

"He and George were both good people. You know, George once sneaked into the old steel mill. I didn't expect the two of them to know each other. George was his squad leader, and he was a worker at the mill. They talked for a long time, saying we should trust Ronald and that he would save us. They encouraged us to hold on."

"Not long after, Tom left. Shortly after that, the old steel mill discovered his contact with outsiders and almost beat him to death. He didn't give up Ronald and George's names. Who knew..."

Bob spoke without any change in expression, and he knew the old man's identity, so it seemed Bob was telling the truth.

Things became clear. Ronald lied to me. He did find Joseph, but after learning about the situation, he didn't report it to the police. Instead, he observed the situation through George and Bob's foster father, becoming familiar with the children at the old steel mill.

But he didn't take action. According to Bob, Ronald was more like a protector of the old steel mill. Even after the mill's activities were exposed, he set up George's murder.

But this explanation didn't hold because, after the fire, Ronald killed all the related members of the old steel mill overnight. This showed he wasn't protecting the mill.

There was another possibility that he received an order from someone who could offer him something better. If an accident occurred, he was to eliminate everyone involved. Who gave him this order, and what deal did they make?

Bob didn't mention this. He was still hiding something from me.

"I investigated in Sand Village. George's cause of death was a fire. He died trying to save his adopted daughter. Now it seems it was Ronald's setup. First, he sent Douglas, who was discovered by George. Then he sent another little girl, using George's compassion to make him willingly walk into the fire."

I said slowly, looking at Bob with a questioning gaze.

"Yes, on the surface, George's death seemed like the old steel mill's doing, but it was Ronald's plan."

Bob sighed, his face pale, and said with lingering fear, "I only figured this out later."

"Who was that little girl, and where did she go?"

I stared at Bob and said seriously, "She was also from the orphanage. I don't believe you didn't know her."

"She died in that fire."

Bob's eyes wandered, looking elsewhere.

"And there were so many kids at the old steel mill. I was a madman with few friends, just Alan, Frank, Lally, and a few others."

He was lying!

###chapter 111 Frank's Top Lawyer

I didn't directly expose his lies.

It seemed that Ronald also intended to hide the fact that the little girl was involved in George's death.

I vaguely felt that this girl was somehow connected to Laura.

What I could confirm now was that Frank had no intention of killing Laura. He might have a mix of love and hate, but no murderous intent.

Think about it, Laura was charming and sociable, thriving in high society and among high-ranking officials. Was it because of her high emotional intelligence, stunning beauty, or unparalleled charisma?

For ordinary people, these might be enough, but for the upper class, these might not even be an entry ticket. No one stayed young and beautiful forever, but there would always be young and beautiful people.

No matter how well Laura did, now that she was over thirty, she couldn't compete with younger girls. No matter how stunning she was, she would eventually age.

What if Laura had some vague connection to the old steel mill incident?

If she, like Douglas, was a child turned by the old steel mill, and then collaborated with Ronald and connected with the big shots behind the scenes, everything seemed to fall into place.

Now that the truth was out, the big shots were eager to cut ties and had Laura imprisoned and trialed. Meanwhile, Tammy, Tony, Lally, Tom, and others were attacking Laura, just as the big shots planned, so they were in a hurry to sentence Laura to death.

Unexpectedly, the evidence was full of holes, and Laura's attorney, Scott, easily left the jury speechless.

Logically, Tammy, Lally, Tom, and Tony all wanted to kill Laura, which must be due to deep hatred. Laura, who also came from the old steel mill, I couldn't imagine any other possibility.

So, logically, Laura should have been executed or died unnaturally long ago. Why was she still in custody?

Who was protecting Laura? I could only think of Frank, who had feelings for Laura, still could forget her, and used hatred as a disguise to numb himself and deceive others.

Scott?

Suddenly, I realized I had overlooked this key person from the beginning.

As long as I found out if he had any connection with Frank, then this clue could confirm that Frank was protecting Laura.

I took out my phone and quickly sent a message to Howard on Facebook:

[Howard, can I still trust you now?]

Howard must have noticed Ronald's actions over the years and must have helped him cover them up.

Almost instantly, Howard replied:

[Yes.]

[I asked you to find Ronald, and Zoey is with you now. That's the biggest trust.]

I sighed and replied:

[Ronald might not be as good as we thought.]

After a while, Howard replied:

[Yes.]

It seemed that Joseph's reason for asking me to find Ronald was not just about Alan's whereabouts. I misunderstood that.

Now that I thought about it, Howard knew I was going to find Bob and Zoey's mom, Erica, one to impound the car and the other to freeze the bank card to restrict Zoey's travel. The reason was not just for safety but to prevent Zoey from knowing the truth.

[Help me check Scott and see how much his law firm collaborates with Frank.]

[No need to check. Frank's top lawyer, everyone in the legal circle knows. What's up?]

Sure enough!

[Guess who the defense attorney for Laura, the defendant in the November Entertainment Club arson and murder case, is?]

I quickly replied.

[Scott? No... Frank, he...]

After a while, Howard sent another message:

[It doesn't matter anymore. No matter what, Zoey must not know about Ronald. I need you to promise me that.]

[Okay.]

Now, the general outline of the Entertainment Club arson and murder case could be determined.

The big shots were indeed starting to close the net, but they didn't act on Laura first. They were waiting for an opportunity.

Frank's target in the Entertainment Club arson and murder case was not Laura but Douglas. Whether Laura's presence at the Entertainment Club was intentional or accidental, I didn't know yet. But recalling the case, did Laura see Alan at that time?

If it was Alan, then there might have been two people in the room at the time of the incident, Alan and Douglas.

If not, then Laura must have seen Douglas. She said so in court to hide the plan to kill Douglas, but she didn't expect some people to turn against her.

The most plausible guess was that Frank and others planned to kill Douglas at the Entertainment Club, and arranged for Douglas to wait in a private room. Alan knew about the plan and went ahead to stop it but failed. The plan succeeded, but a variable appeared. The original plan was to destroy the body, making DNA unmeasurable, and the scene was destroyed. The Entertainment Club's power was cut, eliminating all camera footage. Frank had everything planned outside, with waiters Lally and Tammy as insiders. Douglas, being notorious, wouldn't dare to make a big deal out of it even if discovered. It was almost a perfect murder plan.

But then, Tammy, Lally, Tom, and Tony jumped out, turning as witnesses to accuse Laura of being the murderer, wanting to kill Laura. The big shots didn't expect such a timely opportunity and immediately used special procedures to expedite the case. Frank, eager to save Laura, quickly sent his top lawyer, Scott, to the rescue. Frank used all his connections to fight against the high-ups, which was why Laura had been in custody for so long without being released.

And precisely because of this, Frank and Tom, Tony, Lally, and others were not on the same page. Frank wanted to kill Douglas, while the others wanted to use Frank's plan to punish Laura.

If this guess was correct, then Lally, Tony, and Joseph wanted to tell me the truth behind the case and that Alan was not dead could be reasonably understood.

They were never united, just using each other.

But why didn't Frank tell me these things?

Alan not being dead and the hidden truth behind this case, what was Frank's purpose in hiding these?

"Bob, I'm asking you seriously one last time. I hope you answer truthfully, or I really can't help you."

"Okay."

"What role did you play in this case?"

"I don't know."

###chapter 112 Danger Lurks Everywhere

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"It's not that I don't want to say," Bob shook his head helplessly, "During those days in Silverlight City, I was very unstable, constantly forgetting things. That night of the big fire, I was so scared that I remembered the fire at the steel mill over twenty years ago and passed out."

"Passed out?" I frowned, feeling that Bob hadn't explained things clearly.

"But... in my memory, Douglas's death had nothing to do with me, but I did see him," Bob added, trying to distance himself from the situation.

"Ronald told me he saw you and Mike meeting Alan outside the Entertainment Club. Is that true?"

"Ronald was outside?" Bob was stunned and asked back.

"Yes, that's what he said."

Bob's eyes flickered, and he murmured, "Maybe we didn't notice. I did see Alan that night, but not downstairs. It should have been a coincidence. I don't remember telling Alan about it. He must have found out somehow and came to stop us."

Who could have told Alan about this?

Lally, Tony, Tammy, or Tom?

I thought it was impossible. Given their feelings for Alan, they would never tell him about such illegal activities.

The person who told Alan must have wanted to involve him and even eliminate him to remove any future threats. That must be an enemy.

So it could only be Douglas or Ronald.

"What is your stance on Frank's plan to kill Douglas? Do you think Douglas deserved to die?" I asked suddenly.

"If it were someone else standing in front of me today, I would firmly tell them that I believe in the law and justice. What Frank did has nothing to do with me. I even tried to persuade Frank to forget his hatred and look forward to a better life," Bob said with a self-mocking smile, looking at me.

"Everyone ate at the same table and slept on the same bed. We should have been brothers who shared both joys and hardships, and he swore he would stand with us. But unexpectedly, he was the first to betray us first. If it weren't for him, would I have become who I am today? Tom had one of his eyes forcibly gouged out in a dark room for organ transplantation; he has been afraid of the dark for the rest of his life. What did he do wrong? If it weren't for him, Lally wouldn't have escaped from Sand Village only to be controlled and violated by this bastard. To control Lally, he even went so far as to get Duke addicted to drugs... He has done so many terrible things, harming nearly everyone. A person like him deserves to be tortured a thousand times and die a thousand deaths!"

His expression was ferocious, his eyes red, breathing heavily, his chest heaving. Finally, he sighed, deflating like a balloon about to burst, and slumped down.

"But I... don't want to do it. I don't want to kill him. I finally broke free and wanted to live peacefully with Shirley. This is God's gift to me. I've suffered enough and don't want to carry hatred anymore. I want freedom."

"But if someone wants to kill him, I won't stop them," Bob said seriously.

Breaking free... freedom?

Bob's tone seemed off. I felt that his talk of breaking free and gaining freedom wasn't about the old steel mill.

Just as I was about to ask, the phone rang. It was Leonard.

"Hello? Nancy, where are you?" Leonard's voice was urgent as if something important had happened.

"I'm in Shadow City. What's wrong, Leonard?"

"Benjamin had a car accident on his way back to Silverlight City. He just got out of surgery. You need to be careful and maybe stay away for now!"

Benjamin injured? A car accident?

Impossible. The chances of a police car accident were very low unless...

"Has the operation already started? How is Benjamin now? Who's with him? Don't tell Cindy yet; she's about to have a baby and can't be shocked!"

I stayed calm, thinking of Cindy first. Pregnant women couldn't have emotional fluctuations before and after childbirth. If she got shocked, it could cause premature birth or severe bleeding, which would be irreversible!

"Cindy doesn't know yet. Her mom made an excuse to come over. Benjamin's parents and his apprentice Ruben are here too. I suspect the operation has started, and they wanted to eliminate Benjamin. The doctor said Benjamin had several knife wounds from the past two months."

Leonard sounded relieved knowing I wasn't in Silverlight City and continued, "Benjamin might have been living a life-and-death situation recently. They want to eliminate everyone involved in the case. Benjamin told me he knew what was going on and would reveal everything when he returned. The other side must have known and tried to kill him on his way back!"

I glanced at Bob, who was listening intently.

"I understand."

"Also!" Leonard suddenly remembered something, "Don't hang up, Nancy. Are you in Shadow City to find Bob?"

"Yes."

"Find him and hide or leave town as soon as possible!"

"Why?"

"Mike died yesterday."

"What!" I exclaimed, my mind buzzing.

"Who killed him?"

I asked sadly, not because another key witness was gone, but because Mike was the closest to Alan among the five.

"We haven't found out yet. Mike was shot while jogging in the park. A GLOCK17 was found about 1000 feet from the scene, likely a police gun, but all serial numbers and markings were removed, so we can't trace it."

"Is Frank in Silverlight City these days? Did you find any clues on Mike?"

I immediately thought of Frank. Based on my judgment, these people weren't on the same side as Frank. He might have killed them to prevent them from revealing the truth.

"We can't be sure, but Mike had an unsent message on his phone, addressed to you."

"What?"

[Alan isn't dead. He's being controlled by Frank.]

###chapter 113 The Great Fire

"Then go to Frank's house quickly!"

I finally heard the exact whereabouts of Alan. He was not dead; he was under Frank's control. It felt like the tension in my heart was about to snap, a piercing pain that made me lose my sanity, and I shouted into the phone.

"Nancy, it's crucial to stay patient at times like this. We're investigating Frank. As I mentioned earlier, we searched his house thoroughly yesterday, even using sonic detectors and life detectors to check hidden rooms, but we found nothing. I don't think Frank would keep Alan at his house. You might want to ask Bob again."

"Remember, be safe! You must stay safe!"

With that, Leonard hung up the phone.

I stared at Bob, seriously saying,

"I have no patience left. Tell me, are you still in contact with Frank?"

Bob shook his head, "No more phone calls."

"You must be responsible for your words and actions. What you say now could lead to a wrong judgment. We were college classmates, and you and Alan have been through life and death together. I don't want any more accidents."

I sighed deeply, feeling lost. My eyes inexplicably hot after blinking, tears started to fall.

Alan's whereabouts had thrown me into turmoil, and then there was the news of Mike's murder. Among our college friends, Mike was the most honest and straightforward. He would blush to his ears when talking to girls. He was steady, and diligent, and always dreamed of becoming a teacher after graduation, living a stable life.

He was sensitive and cautious, always carrying a hearing aid due to congenital hearing loss. To look normal, he followed the trend, wearing an earphone in one ear and hiding the hearing aid's main unit in his pants pocket, looking like a boy listening to music. Thinking back, the congenital hearing loss might have been a lie, probably due to abuse at the old steel mill.

He was kind-hearted and compassionate. Among college boys, his tear ducts were more active than girls'. He couldn't bear sad stories or see classmates in trouble. He had little money, relying on part-time jobs during vacations and school grants. Whenever he heard about school donations, he would cry and donate a few hundred dollars, leaving just enough for his meals.

Whenever I had a fight with Alan, he would find me on the playground, bringing a cup of juice, quietly placing it beside me, sitting with me for a long time, and softly saying.

"Alan said he knows he was wrong. Do you want to forgive him, or can you two not make me the middleman next time?"

Now, the boy who liked wearing plaid shirts, and faded jeans, thin and clean, had left this world, dying yesterday.

Today, the sun rose and set as usual, and the world remained unchanged.

"Mike was murdered last night."

"Bob, what else are you hiding from me? You need to tell me. Lally is missing, Tony is missing, and now Mike is dead. I don't want you to be next."

Tears streamed down my face as I shook the despondent Bob's shoulders.

After a while, Bob hoarsely said,

"Okay, I'll tell you... That day, we planned to kill not only Douglas but also..."

Suddenly, the hospital room door was flung open!

Shirley rushed in, seemingly having kicked something. Looking down, it was a packed dinner.

I suddenly remembered, why hadn't Zoey come back yet?

She left the dinner at the door without coming in; she must have heard something!

Damn! She knew about Ronald's identity!

"Bob! Something's wrong! Someone from the first floor just called, the house is on fire!"

Shirley shouted!

Bob jumped out of bed and rushed out the door!

Things got worse! Cedric from the old steel mill was still at the house!

The house was fine in the afternoon, and there were no flammable or explosive materials stored around. How could it suddenly catch fire?

Ronald!

I finally understood it wasn't Frank who killed Mike, it was Ronald!

And Leonard mentioned on the phone that it was a police gun. I thought it was a framing trick, but Ronald used a police gun to shoot!

This man was completely insane!

Killing Cedric from the old steel mill was understandable, but why killed Mike?

I couldn't think too much, quickly following Bob and Shirley, and calling Zoey, but no one answered.

At that moment, my heart was in complete chaos. I had no idea what foolish thing Zoey might do next.

[Zoey, don't do anything foolish. No matter what happens, I'm here for you. You're not just my apprentice; I've always seen you as a little sister. Zoey, be good, call me back. It's dangerous outside. Even if you just send a message, I'm worried about you!]

After sending the message, I had already reached the hospital's ground floor. Bob and Shirley had hailed a cab. Just then, another cab came by, and I quickly flagged it down.

"Where to?"

"Follow that car in front, catch up with them! Wherever they go, we go. You can keep the extra money, and if it's not enough, I'll make up for it!"

I said, throwing the driver $100. The driver didn't ask anything, it was late at night, and there were few cars in town. He stepped on the gas, speeding toward Bob and Shirley's direction.

During the ride, Zoey still hadn't replied. I couldn't wait any longer and called Howard.

"Howard, I'm sorry, Zoey found out about Ronald. She's missing now, and I can't reach her. Do you have any connections in Shadow City? Please ask someone to find her. Ronald is crazy. He killed Mike yesterday and came to Shadow City today to kill the witness from the old steel mill who has evidence of his crimes!"

"It's okay, now's not the time for self-blame. Zoey would have found out sooner or later. I guess Zoey went to find Ronald. Wherever Ronald is, Zoey will be there. Find Ronald, and you'll find Zoey!"

Howard's voice was steady, but he was starting to speak incoherently, trying to stay calm.

If Zoey went to find Ronald, which was good. Ronald must be near Bob's house, maybe even inside, preparing to kill Cedric!

That meant Zoey hadn't been gone long, at least since hearing about Mike's murder, she immediately thought the killer was Ronald and went to Bob's house first!

"I understand. Don't worry, I'll find her!"

###chapter 114 The Truth

When we were about 1,000 feet away from Bob's house, we saw a bright red glow coming from a room on the third floor.

Thick smoke was billowing out of the windows, accompanied by flames greedily licking the outer walls. The air conditioning ducts had already been destroyed, and the fire seemed to be spreading towards the roof.

From a distance, it looked like a piece of meat stained with fresh blood, rotting and corroding in this winter.

A crowd had already gathered below. The taxi in front stopped, and Bob shouted "Dad!" without any hesitation. He dashed through the crowd and rushed towards the third floor, with Shirley following closely behind.

The driver stopped the car, craned his neck to look at the flames, and shouted, "Damn, whose house is on fire? There must be someone inside, why hasn't anyone called the fire department?"

I didn't have time to chat with him; the $100 fare was enough.

I opened the car door, rushed through the crowd, and followed the two into the building.

The fire hadn't spread to the lower floors yet. Ignoring the people around me, I heard noises from above, indicating that Bob had already started breaking down the door. I quickly climbed the stairs, taking three or four steps at a time, heading towards the third floor.

As soon as I reached the third floor, Bob forcefully broke down the door and stumbled inside due to the inertia.

"Dad!" Bob cried out, his voice choked with sobs.

I hurried in after him and realized something was wrong. Only the balcony in the living room was on fire, with a pile of clothes and gasoline creating the illusion of a large fire, but the entire living room was empty, and there was no sign of a fire elsewhere.

Bob searched every room but couldn't find Cedric.

We had been tricked!

This was a trap to lure us here!

"Quick, it's a trap!"

I shouted, turning to leave.

Suddenly, the door to Shirley's room on the right opened halfway, and a lifeless Cedric, slumped in a wheelchair, appeared at the door.

I was genuinely startled. The last time we saw Cedric, he had his back to us, so we didn't see his face.

Eighty percent of his face was burned, leaving only his eyes and forehead unscathed. It must have been an old injury from a severe burn, with the skin and fat on his face shriveled and covered in tiny holes. Anyone seeing it for the first time would be horrified, especially at night.

No wonder he had his back to us that day.

Was it an old injury from the fire at the old steel mill?

I wondered to myself.

"Too late... the opportunity has already been given to you."

Unlike before, Ronald, who was usually covered in grease, was now dressed in clean sportswear. He pushed the wheelchair slowly out of the room.

"Ms. Johnson, hello." Ronald greeted me with a smile.

"Ronald! You despicable, untrustworthy scoundrel, let my dad go!"

Bob roared, ready to charge forward, but Ronald's right hand slowly moved the gun to Cedric's temple.

"Sometimes I wonder, which one is the real you? The one crushed by life, living like a dog in Shadow City, or the once arrogant, self-proclaimed genius you?"

Ronald sighed twice, shaking his head as he looked at Bob.

"Neither of you listens, and I don't like disobedient children."

"I wasn't disobedient!" Bob cried, "Please let us go. Ever since we left the old steel mill, I've done everything you asked. We've made you so much money. You promised not to bother us anymore, and I wouldn't leave Shadow City."

Ronald looked at Bob with pity and sighed.

"Disobedient child, you're still arguing."

His voice was incredibly gentle, his face showing reluctance like a father patiently reasoning with a wayward son. But at this moment, it sounded like the voice of a devil.

"Frank's little scheme, inciting you to kill Douglas, and you went along with it? Douglas was such an obedient child, and now he's dead. It was just a bit of childish mischief, wasn't it? If he was dead, then so be it. I said back then, the grudges were settled!"

Ronald said sternly, his eyes flashing with ferocity.

"Douglas was a bastard, a motherless child. He was worse than a bastard!" Bob glared at Ronald, speaking viciously. I could even hear the grinding of his teeth.

"Disobedient, huh? Tell me, did Tom die? No, he didn't. Isn't he the number one person in Silverlight City? He's made a lot of money over the years, and I've helped a lot. Did Frank die? No, he didn't. He even thought of opposing me."

Ronald sighed deeply, shaking his head at Bob.

"You all don't realize, if it weren't for me, you'd be dead long ago. I'm your savior. I've spent so much effort nurturing you. But never mind, young people these days don't like to hear this. Douglas is dead, and you all are fighting among yourselves, trying to kill Laura. Frank is doing everything to protect Laura. Seeing your incompetence makes me feel sad. Laura killed George back then, yes, I instructed her. I also suggested to deceive the kids from Sand Village. Now, Bob, tell me why?"

Bob's eyes were filled with fear. He was terrified of the person in front of him, trembling uncontrollably and shaking his head instinctively.

"Wasn't it for your unity and friendship? I even took care of the kids from Sand Village for your sake."

Ronald frowned, looking disappointed. He took a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, took a deep drag, and pointed at Bob.

"But you and Mike, I'm very disappointed."

"I've been thinking, how did they suddenly know that Laura was the one who killed George? It's impossible. Only Laura, Douglas, and I knew. After much thought, I realized there was one more person who knew. Ms. Johnson, my daughter's mentor, can you guess who it is?"

I said coldly. "You don't deserve to be Zoey's father."

"Look, Bob, you two are classmates. Look at Ms. Johnson, then look at yourself."

Ronald pointed at me, then at Bob, looking disappointed.

"Ms. Johnson hit my weak spot with just one sentence. But... it doesn't matter. Ms. Johnson, your criminal investigation talent isn't as good as my daughter's, but your logical reasoning ability far surpasses Zoey's. Leonard couldn't keep you in the prosecutor's office back then, which was a loss for the office and his incompetence."

"Back to the point, Ms. Johnson, can you guess why they knew Laura was the one who killed George? Who told them?"

"George didn't die."

I stared at Ronald, sneering.

"You didn't expect that the one who died was the cook. George didn't die; he's sitting in the wheelchair right now."

###chapter 115 Substitute for Death

Ronald clapped his hands in appreciation.

"Remarkable! Impressive!"

"I've been thinking about this for over two months before I figured it out, and you got it in just a moment or an instant?"

"Tell me quickly, this matter is very important to me. I have to admit, you are definitely qualified to be my daughter's mentor. Howard's judgment was right. If I were Howard, I would have chosen you without hesitation, and I would have introduced you even earlier!"

Ronald was dignified, like a leader publicly praising outstanding workers at a meeting.

"Firstly, I have seen a photo of George from over twenty years ago. Although his face was burned, his eyes still bear some resemblance. However, since it's an old photo from over twenty years ago when George was still young, we can't conclude from this alone."

"Yes, makes sense, go on," Ronald said.

"Secondly, Bob recalled the incident where you deceived George and Cedric back then. I paid special attention to two details. The first detail is that George and the cook Cedric knew each other; they were both employees at the old steel mill, and George was his foreman. The second detail is that when the old steel mill discovered Cedric was in contact with the outside world, they almost beat Cedric to death, but he still didn't give up George."

"What can you deduce from this?" Ronald asked with a frown.

"You... still don't understand George. In your perception, people have no emotions. George is just a brainless, enthusiastic fool."

I looked at Ronald's puzzled expression and sneered.

"In your eyes, perhaps only power and status can earn people's respect and recognition."

"Isn't it? Could it be Frank and Tom, or Howard's pursuit of money?" Ronald sneered disdainfully.

"Giving up power for money is a mistake almost everyone in this city makes. Money is like the villa Frank bought in Starlight Rivers District, with a shelf life of only a few decades. Power is like ancient stone buildings that can stand for hundreds or even thousands of years. Even if they are damaged, like the Delphi Temple, or even if they disappear, like the legend of Atlantis, people still talk about them with great interest and continue to pursue them. Do you understand? In this world, only power matters, and all beings will crawl at your feet!"

"You are wrong. George is uneducated, and never went to college; he is just a worker. Yet this worker earned everyone's recognition in the factory. He proved his fairness and selflessness through his actions, winning everyone's trust. Even after he disappeared from Sand Village for over twenty years, people still remember his goodness. Such a remarkable character will inevitably inspire others to sacrifice for him. Or rather, the cook who died for George did so not for George himself, but for the light of humanity, for kindness, friendship, nobility, goodness, optimism, confidence, and so on. These are the purest and most noble qualities of being human, and they are eternal."

"George had it, my husband Alan had it, and they influenced Tony, Lally, Tom, Joseph, and others. But you don't, because you don't understand."

Ronald was silent for a long time, then nodded with difficulty.

"Nancy, I don't agree with your viewpoint, but I respect your right to express it and acknowledge its rationality. However, this is a base, vulgar, and fragile human weakness. You need to understand that your reasoning is acceptable. Continue, what is the third point?"

"The third point is the hint you just gave me. Laura is the girl who tried to kill George back then. I guessed this. You had Laura deceive others and conceal this matter. So, the ones who know the truth are you, Laura, and Douglas, the three suspects. It's a very simple logic, in a case, those who know the details are not only the suspects but also the victim. Since the suspects didn't speak, the one who did must be the victim."

"Combining the above two points, I can easily guess that this person is George himself."

I looked at Ronald's thoughtful expression and felt a wave of sadness. How heartless could this person be? I continued.

"So, the reason you killed Mike and Bob is not because Frank planned to kill Douglas, nor for the infighting among those kids back then. You don't care whether Laura lives or dies, nor who wants to kill Laura or protect her. On the contrary, if they did well, you would be very pleased with your teaching. Am I right?"

"Correct. If it weren't for Alan's interference, Frank would have been my best disciple. But Frank always resented Alan, wondering why every step he took couldn't escape Alan's predictions. You and Alan are indeed a perfect match."

Ronald laughed bitterly.

"Because Frank could never let go of his hatred, while Alan could. When a person is deeply obsessed, their potential is most stimulated, but also when they are most vulnerable. Alan seized on this point."

I didn't know how Alan intervened, but from his guidance, I understood that he had known about Frank's schemes from the beginning. He hid clues in the Silverlight City Journal's archives and the notes he left for me.

Without his guidance, I wouldn't have investigated this far.

"So, the real reason you killed Mike and Bob is because they knew it was Cedric who died back then, not George. And the two of them should have been in frequent contact. At this time, George told them about the incident where he was framed. One of them told Tony, Tom, and others the truth. However..."

I glanced at Bob and said lightly.

"These two also wanted to use someone else's hand to kill Laura, so they only told the real culprit but didn't reveal that George was still alive. As for the reason, it's easy to guess."

"I initially wondered how a seven or eight-year-old child like Douglas could have the power to plan this and harm all the other children one by one. Then, considering Laura's behavior and the incident of framing George, I suddenly understood. The children who betrayed the oath of sharing weal and woe and advancing and retreating together were not just Douglas, but also Laura."

Bob trembled violently, his face pale, looking at me in disbelief.

It seemed I guessed right again.

"And you, Ronald, have been covering for Laura, not exposing her identity. The reason is also easy to guess. You believe in power and have a strong desire for control. Douglas and the others have a grudge against each other, so they can't play together. Even if they appear harmonious in front of you, they probably hate each other behind your back. You fear losing control over the children, so you planted another pawn, which is Laura."

###chapter 116 He Wants Your Life

"You placed Laura among them, the college five, such a beautiful friendship. Have you seen their photos from college? Their smiles were so bright. These kids with turbulent destinies actually went to college and started a new ###chapter in their lives. Maybe even Laura believed in the so-called friendship at that moment."

"In this regard, you were successful. Not only did you monitor Mike, Bob, and Frank, but you also indirectly controlled Alan, who had already run away. These kids will never escape your control. But you didn't expect that George didn't die and Laura's identity was exposed."

"Douglas's death doesn't matter to you. What you care about is Mike and Bob's concealment from you, and the fact that the witness to your numerous crimes is still alive. Therefore, you are restless, even willing to take risks and act personally."

I faced Ronald without fear, looking him straight in the eye. At that moment, I didn't need to have any fear, even if he had a gun. I knew that someone like Ronald, who had a strong desire for control and extreme confidence in his ability to manage everything, wouldn't be angry about the truth being revealed. On the contrary, he would be quite excited.

Howard once said that Ronald was a genius in their law class. Not only was he excellent in law, but he also self-studied criminal investigation, being well-versed in almost every aspect. In his junior year, he assisted the city's criminal investigation team in solving a major case in Silverlight City, gaining great fame. After graduating from college, he joined the police force.

For ordinary people, problems were a headache. For geniuses, problems made them ecstatic. There was an almost fanatical attribute in their genes, where every adventure was a huge dopamine stimulus for them.

Ronald was even more so. He wasn't worried that anyone could take him down, but he longed for someone who could truly understand him.

He grinned excitedly, continuously tapping the wheelchair armrest, his eyes shining. After a while, he finally said, "Very good, Nancy, I said you are very good, but your analysis and speculation are still a bit off. I came to find Bob, to see my old friend, which is correct. Wanting to kill the two of them is also correct. But Mike, it's not just that. I originally thought that even if Mike had ten times the courage, he wouldn't dare to do such a thing!"

His face became extremely ferocious, ready to say something.

"Benjamin."I interrupted him without hesitation.

Ronald's expression became unnatural. He looked at me with a bit of surprise, thought for a moment, and suddenly realized, muttering, "So that's it."

I added, "Benjamin is the captain of the city's criminal investigation team and you are the deputy captain of the state's criminal investigation team. A transfer order sent him to go for training out of town. He was supposed to return in about half a month, but it was delayed until these past few days. Leonard said that the state police department hadn't issued any more transfer orders. That's when I started to wonder, where exactly did Benjamin go. Why did he have a car accident before even entering Silverlight City? No need to think, it must have been arranged by you."

As I spoke, I took out my phone and pulled up Benjamin's call and transaction records that were sent to me while I was in the car.

From early December until now, for more than half a month, Benjamin was not in the South but in Harmony City, where Mike was. I also pulled up all the phone numbers related to Harmony City from Benjamin's call records.

Except for the takeout numbers, the remaining four numbers all belonged to one person, Mike.

I showed Ronald the screenshots on my phone page by page and said in a deep voice, "The reason you were desperate to kill Mike was not because he exposed Laura's identity but because he told Benjamin everything about you!"

"Just like you said next to the Entertainment Club, Benjamin disguising himself as an undercover cop was foolish, but his criminal investigation skills were top-notch. If there was no transfer order, Benjamin would have had to return to Silverlight City to report. If the transfer order didn't come from the state police department, who else would have the authority to bypass the state police department and directly order the Silverlight City police department to investigate? You deceived Howard. You weren't truly demoted. I don't know who is backing you, but now you are not safe either, Ronald."

I took a deep breath and my palms were already sweaty. I had said so much analysis, not to show off, and my guesses might not be correct, but my goal was to break Ronald's psychological defense.

What a joke, I even felt a bit overconfident. Ronald was a seasoned criminal investigator, rising from the grassroots to the position of deputy captain of the state's criminal investigation team. How could I break such a psychological defense?

But there was no other way. If I called the police now, the bullet would go through my head before the call connected.

What worried me even more was that Zoey wasn't nearby. Ronald shouldn't be crazy enough to harm his own daughter. I could only silently pray.

"There's more." Seeing Ronald not speaking, I decided to attack again.

.

He said, "What else?"

Ronald, deep in thought, raised an eyebrow, looked at me playfully, and nodded, signaling me to continue.

I was very nervous. He was extremely confident in his backers. My previous analysis hadn't had much effect on him. In a moment of inspiration, I suddenly thought of his fatal weakness.

I added, "Your control over the years has also collapsed."

He replied, "Go on."

"In the letter Lally left me, she mentioned that the revenge had been taken. Now it seems that it was Douglas who was killed, and Laura is also in prison, probably not coming out. I suspect those leaders, your backers, want to kill Laura, but Frank is protecting her. But then I wondered, where did Frank get such power to contend with big figures?" I spoke lightly and looked at Ronald, observing his subtle expressions to make appropriate judgments.

"He doesn't have much money left and the money he uses to sustain himself is being spent on maintaining connections. It's a bottomless pit. You kids, one by one, have no patience." Ronald smiled, shaking his head in lament.

I replied, "Coincidentally, I initially thought so too. But now, I have a new idea."

I smirked. For someone as confident as Ronald, I felt genuine displeasure and said softly, "I just thought of it. The ones who know all your secrets are not just Mike, but also the other kids you brought up. They wouldn't dare to defy you, but I'm not sure about Frank. With his status, it's not hard for him to reach the upper echelons of Silverlight City or even the big figures in the state. What if... Frank betrayed you?"

Ronald's eye twitched slightly, a hint of dread flashing through. I caught this subtle expression.

It worked!

He said, "Your speculation is a bit far-fetched, Ms. Johnson."

I replied, "No, I have solid evidence."

I smiled, recalling the text message Tony sent me. Everything matched up now, and I said happily, "Tony sent me a text before he disappeared, saying these people are all crazy. These people must include Frank. What does crazy mean? Now it seems Douglas was also killed. The people at the old steel mill were killed by you over twenty years ago. So why would he go crazy?"

I looked deeply at Ronald and said slowly," Frank wants your life... Mr. Carter."

###chapter 117 I'm Not as Good as You

He continued, "Children always think about overthrowing adults as if their lives would be complete if they did."

Ronald shook his head helplessly and sighed, "Frank has been very scheming since he was a child. Sometimes, even I don't know what he's thinking. But then again, children are just children. What they think about is nothing more than what they gain and what they lose, doing meaningless addition and subtraction. They will always look up to me, fearing me as they would fear a deity, and that's enough."

The black muzzle of the gun slowly moved away from George's head, like a black-mouthed snake searching for its next prey, and slowly, it aimed at me.

Ronald's hand was very steady, the muzzle didn't shake at all. Despite his years in the workplace, he hadn't forgotten the basics of being a criminal detective. The moment he pulled the trigger, I would close my eyes forever.

In my thirty-plus years of life, I've encountered many crises. But this time, facing the muzzle of the gun, I truly felt the terror of a life-and-death moment. The subconscious fear surged like a tide. I tried to adjust my breathing to calm my heartbeat.

Clenching my fists tightly, sweat had already seeped through my fingers. My thumb's nail dug into my index finger's joint, using the sharp pain to dispel fear and maintain rationality. Unexpectedly, the sweat made it too slippery, and my thumb exerted too much force, cutting the joint of my index finger.

A sharp pain instantly brought me back to my senses. The next second, George, who was slumped in the wheelchair, suddenly brightened his eyes and stood up quickly. He turned around, grabbed Ronald's right hand holding the gun with one hand, and pushed him back with the other.

Ronald never expected that George, who had been paralyzed for so long, could suddenly attack, and he didn't react in time.

They fell to the ground with a thud.

It seemed like the sound of bones breaking, accompanied by a painful groan.

George closed his eyes, his face pale, sweat dripping from his forehead, his lips trembling slightly, "Stubborn man, old friend, after more than twenty years, this counts as a hug."

"Run!"A hoarse shout came from George's throat.

"Dad!"

"Mr. Thompson!"

Bob and I shouted in unison.

Before the words were finished, a gunshot rang out, and a bullet hole appeared about 0.1 feet from my foot.

Ronald shouted, "Adults are talking, kids shouldn't interrupt, and definitely shouldn't sneak out to play."

Ronald shook the gun in his hand, coughed a few times, and said slowly, "Don't guess, the one with the broken bone isn't me, it's my old friend here. His rib hit the gun muzzle, I haven't fired yet. Ms. Johnson, don't you think I'm too soft-hearted?"

Ronald tilted his head and looked at me, continuing, "I don't know why, but I feel a special connection when talking to you. If I had another chance, maybe I should have gone to Silverlight University Law School when you graduated, and taken you under my wing before Leonard did. Would the outcome be different? Then you could be Zoey's mentor, and I would be completely at ease."

"When people face a dead end, they often think a lot." I wasn't afraid at all and retorted.

Ronald smiled without saying anything, propped himself up with his left arm, and kicked George aside.

George spat out a mouthful of blood, half leaning against the door, clutching his chest and gasping for breath, his eyes fixed on Ronald. That look was like a hunter staring at the beast that killed him, with no fear, only endless hatred and unwillingness.

His skin was more wrinkled, the burned skin gathered together, and new skin could vaguely be seen.

A fake mask?

Just as I was thinking, Ronald noticed it too, paused, tilted his head to look at George's face, then laughed, and suddenly tore off George's mask!

George's true face was revealed before me. After more than twenty years, he was no longer the young and strong man in the photo at Tammy's house in Sand Village. In his sixties, his cheeks were sunken, his face full of wrinkles, his hair gray, and even age spots had appeared. But his eyes were as bright as in the photo.

Ronald lit a cigarette, took a couple of puffs, and handed it over. George hesitated, then reached out to take it. Ronald then lit another cigarette for himself.

For a moment, it was a strange scene. Two old men sitting on the ground, one leaning against the doorpost, the other against the door as if they were old friends who hadn't seen each other for years due to many grievances. Soon, smoke surrounded them, and they smoked in silence, occasionally coughing.

Ronald said, "Back then, you asked me if you were fit to be a cop, such a naive question."

Ronald squinted and smiled, "I was surprised that a man in his thirties still dreamed like a hot-blooded teenager. But it turns out, you do have a bit of a cop in you."

George replied, "And you?"

George coughed violently, blood continuously oozing from his mouth. Bob cried heart-wrenchingly, wanting to come over, but George stopped him.

"Me?"

Ronald paused, thought seriously for a moment, and sighed, "I'm not as good as you."

George said, "In what way?"

Ronald continued, "Just the fact that you fooled me, I'm not as good as you. You and Bob, Mike, did you plan all this long ago, waiting for today's chance for revenge? I remember now, that Frank said you were sick. No, it wasn't you, I thought it was that silly cook Cedric. I thought it was Laura's doing, she was afraid you'd expose her identity, so she made you completely paralyzed, unable to speak."

Ronald lightly punched George, like an old friend meeting, not too hard, somewhat jokingly, "You old guy, I thought you were really dead, never expected you could hide for so many years without a word. This patience, you'd make a good criminal detective."

George replied, "You..."

George coughed a few times, his face paler, his eyes starting to dim. I vaguely felt something was wrong. A broken rib shouldn't cause this situation; instead, it should cause intense pain and leave him drenched in sweat. But George looked like a dying old man, his voice much weaker.

After catching his breath for a while, he continued, "You, too ambitious. Back then, you were under thirty, just started working, and had great potential. But you cared too much about fame and fortune, felt ostracized by the police force, and your father-in-law looked down on you. You often came to me for a drink."

What? George and Ronald were that close, even to the point of confiding in each other!

No wonder Tony and Tom always wanted me to leave Silverlight City. It was because Ronald had been controlling them. Ronald was like a deity, so they didn't dare to defy him.

###chapter 118 Dad, Stop

However, what shocked me even more was yet to come.

"Your dorm mate, your good friend, Howard? Didn't he drink a few times with us too? I heard he's doing quite well now. And your wife, even more impressive, she has a daughter."

He glanced at me intentionally or unintentionally, his eyes full of kindness.

He continued, "If you hadn't made that one wrong decision back then, how great it would be. Wouldn't I be able to share in your glory?"

As he spoke, he habitually lifted his arm holding a cigarette, his eyes occasionally looking at the stairs as if he was waiting for something.

Ronald lowered his head in silence, gently wiping his gun, which was shiny and dark, reflecting a dim light. After a long time, he said sadly, "When did you find out? Was it that time with Douglas?"

George replied, "No, it was a bit earlier."

The cigarette in George's hand went out. He extended his right hand to hold a cigarette. Ronald, sensing his cue, lit a cigarette and passed it to him."

The cigarette was lit and wisps of smoke slowly rose into the air. George took the cigarette but didn't smoke it; instead, he watched as the glowing tip gradually consumed the white paper. After a moment of silence, he flicked the ash and finally spoke.

"It should have been the day Joseph came out of the hospital. I regret telling you about the old steel mill. I admit I had selfish motives, thinking I could help you make a big achievement. In the future, whether in the police force or with your father-in-law, you could hold your head high."

That day at a snack stall near the Entertainment Club, Ronald said he had accidentally met Joseph and saved him. Little did I know it was George who first discovered the old steel mill and had become familiar with the kids there before telling Ronald about it.

I looked at Ronald coldly. This person's mind was truly terrifying to the extreme. He not only wanted to change history but also intended to kill his benefactor, George.

George added, "I contacted Tom for a long time, but the old steel mill wouldn't let him go. But when you came, things became much easier. At that time, I was more certain that you had a connection with the old steel mill. Later, with Douglas and Laura, I had already seen that those two had problems, but you kept suggesting I adopt them. At that time, I knew you had bad intentions."

I couldn't help but ask. "Mr. Thompson, you knew it was a trap, so why did you still go?"

"Nancy, Alan's wife, you're great. My godson has good taste, and I'm very satisfied."

George looked at me and laughed, nodding in satisfaction, "You already know the answer to that question. Alan will tell you in the future."

Alan should know that George was not dead, which meant Alan had always known that Laura was one of the masterminds behind framing George. But why didn't he bring it up?

George noticed my expression, coughed twice, and said softly, "Don't blame him."

Don't blame him. What should I blame Alan for? For not telling me about his painful memories, or for not letting me face the storms with him, or for not contacting me after he disappeared? This journey was so dangerous. If it were me, I wouldn't have told Alan either.

I just wanted him to live safely, and I already guessed where Alan was.

I shook my head and choked up, "I never blamed him."

George responded, his face getting worse, and blood started to seep from his hand pressing on his chest.

A small knife was stuck in George's chest. The moment he fell, Ronald reacted, pulled out a small knife, and stabbed it straight in. The sound of bone cracking earlier was the sound of the knife breaking through the bone!

George no longer had the strength to press on his chest and his left hand hung weakly. Blood slowly flowed from his chest, staining the ground. His eyes glazed over, his mind unclear. He relied entirely on willpower to hold on, occasionally looking at the staircase with difficulty.

It seemed like he was waiting for something.

George said, "Ronald,  I was very angry when I found out about it back then. But later, I thought that you were so young and making a mistake was inevitable. You wanted to use my feelings for the kids to kill me. But that day, the person I really wanted to save was you. I wanted to expose you face to face. Come back with me..."

George's breath gradually weakened, his chest heaving violently. He breathed heavily, his mouth moving as if trying to speak, but in the end, he couldn't manage to say the last few words.

Ronald suddenly looked up, staring at George in disbelief.

Bob shouted "Dad," disregarding the gun in Ronald's hand, and rushed to George, pressing hard on the wound to slow the bleeding.

Bob shouted, "Nancy, call for help!"

Ronald responded, "Don't move!"

Ronald's gun was pointed straight at me, his finger already on the trigger.

He said, "After twenty years, listening to George's teachings again is quite nice. People live to pursue something. You seek integrity and a clear conscience, and I give you for that. But what about what I want? Who will provide that for me?"

Ronald stood up, his eyes red, and sighed deeply, saying slowly, "Power, status, and fame are what I pursue, but not entirely. What I want most in this life is to have everything under my control. If I want someone to live, they live. If I want them to die, they die. This feeling, you can't understand. Alright, enough time has been delayed. Your reinforcements won't come, Ms. Johnson. The police and fire department won't be coming today. You don't need to wait anymore."

Footsteps came from the floor below, moving quickly, seemingly heading straight for the fourth floor.

Ronald's face changed slightly as if he had thought of something. He glared at George, and his finger on the trigger slowly pressed down.

The moment the trigger bent down, it felt like someone pushed me hard, causing me to fall to the ground.

"Dad!"Zoey cried.

This cry was filled with fragility, grievance, hatred, and helplessness. Zoey stood in front of me, arms outstretched, blocking me like a wall.

"Zoey!"Ronald and I shouted in unison!

I grabbed Zoey's shoulders, turned her around, and wrapped her in my arms, my back facing Ronald.

"I'm sorry, Mrs. Smith. I'm sorry, everyone. It's all my fault. It's my mistake." Zoey lay on my shoulder, crying loudly.

"It's not your fault."

I comforted her softly. She was filled with self-blame and guilt, and also utter despair. She never expected that the mastermind behind the major case spanning over twenty years was her deeply respected and admired father.

At that moment, her world collapsed.

###chapter 119 Who Have You Become? Alan

The dim room.

The ceiling was so low that you could touch it by reaching up.

The walls were covered with special cotton layers, providing soundproofing and preventing those trapped inside from committing suicide.

A vertically placed bed and a horizontally positioned table had already filled the room.

The light was dim, making it hard to see inside the room. To be precise, it was difficult to make out the situation inside this "box".

Here, it seemed as if the air had stopped circulating. The cramped, small space felt stifling, making it hard to breathe.

A hand groped around in the darkness for the switch and gently pressed it.

The dim yellow light illuminated the table.

On the table, there was a neatly arranged stack of books, a fountain pen with its cap on, an old green desk lamp, and a pile of manuscript paper densely covered with writing.

A person's shadow was cast on the manuscript paper. His hair was a mess; it looked like he hadn't had a haircut in a while.

Slender, long fingers picked up the fountain pen and unscrewed the cap. The pen tip danced on the manuscript paper, the handwriting lively and flowing like silk, exuding a sense of life.

"December 23, 2024, weather unknown."

"However, a few days ago, the temperature suddenly dropped, and I woke up several times at night from the cold. I guess in a couple of days, the snow will start falling in Silverlight City."

"In previous years, around New Year's, Silverlight City always had heavy snow. Even though the north is dry and has little precipitation throughout the year, it always snows a bit. The heavy snow would fall for days, covering time and history, but it couldn't cover our longing, the aroma of home-cooked meals, and the loneliness between heaven and earth..."

At that point, the pen tip paused, a light sigh was heard, and then continued writing.

"For the past two months, I've been restless at night, often dreaming of Nancy. She looks at me and cries continuously as if all the times Nancy cried in her life were seen in my dreams. I feel heartbroken, guilty, and powerless, and can only cry with her."

Tears soaked the manuscript paper, the pen tip trembled slightly, and after a long time, continued writing.

"I had anticipated a bad outcome, but I didn't expect it to come so quickly. Actually, during that time, Nancy had already noticed my abnormal behavior. She didn't ask out of trust, and I didn't say anything because I wanted to find the right opportunity to tell Nancy about the old steel mill, about my childhood and friends."

The sound of a door opening was heard.

The pen tip stopped, the cap was put back on, and the pen was gently placed on the edge of the table.

Frank slowly wheeled in, looking more haggard. He was so thin that he seemed little more than skin and bones. In his thirties, his hair was already gray, and his face was devoid of any color as if it had been dusted with frost.

The only thing that hadn't changed was his eyes, which had sunken into his gaunt sockets, appearing even more eerie and intimidating.

He stared at the man sitting in the chair. His dark, deep eyes blinked, and he remained silent. After a moment, the man turned and smiled at him.

"You're here, Frank."

Frank was taken aback. During this period, the man had always had his back to him, never turning around. Why was he now taking the initiative to greet him?

He was a bit surprised, and a warm feeling arose in his heart. The man was a friend who had gone through thick and thin with him at the old steel mill during their childhood. Those four years in college were their happiest years. He was the one who told him the meaning of life and pulled him back from the brink of suicide.

Frank felt a bit emotional. The man in front of him had remained the same for over twenty years. He wasn't particularly good-looking, to be honest. In terms of features, he was neither as delicate as Joseph nor as dashing as Bob, not even as good-looking as himself. Among the group of kids, he was extremely ordinary, as ordinary as could be.

He has a gentle expression and eyes as calm as a lake. Despite being confined in this dark, sunless room, he had not only maintained his will but had also remained full of vitality. Frank felt a surge of jealousy.

"Do you hate me?"Frank rubbed his face, glanced around the room, and suddenly asked.

"Why would I hate you?" The man was taken aback, not understanding why Frank would ask such a question.

Frank frowned, raised his hand to point at the room, and leaned forward. He didn't know where the anger came from andsaid sharply,"I've kept you locked up here for nearly two months, and you don't hate me?"

The man replied, "There's a bed, a table and chairs, a lamp. You even prepared books, paper, and a pen. You know my hobbies and my preference for a quiet life. This place is the quietest, and you even added soundproofing cotton. Why should I hate you?"

The man smiled and said seriously, "Frank, if I hated you, I would be heartless."

Frank sneered, "You're implying that I'm heartless."

"Why would you think that?" The man shook his head, his eyes dimming. "Among our friends, in some ways, no one understands each other better than we do. At least, that's what I used to think."

Frank said, "That's true."

With a beep, the electric wheelchair slowly moved forward and stopped beside the man. Frank was half-lay in the wheelchair, adjusted to a more comfortable position. He looked at the man, and suddenly laughed, "We've never really talked like this. When we were kids, we thought about how to get enough to eat, how to avoid beatings, and how to escape those strange abuses. Later, you were in Sand Village, and I was in Shadow City. We mostly communicated through letters because phone calls were too expensive. We contacted each other a few times a year, mostly feeling lucky to have survived. Of course, my days in Shadow City weren't that great either."

Frank paused, took a long breath, his eyes shining, and continued, "We agreed to apply to the same university. If it weren't for Douglas misleading Duke, Lally would have smoothly finished his studies. In the end, it was Duke who was useless!"

Mentioning Duke, Frank snorted, and the man nodded in agreement, "I agree with that."

Frank continued, "In college, we had fun in the opera club and were full of hope for the future. But I always felt that feeling was fake, unreal, something intangible. It was merely depicted through words and emotions and just a fantasy born from an excess of youthful hormones, like deceiving ourselves, like a stage play. You wrote so many scripts, but did you become a screenwriter? Did you become the person you wanted to be, Alan?"

Frank tilted his head to look at Alan.

Alan replied, "No, after graduating from college, I became a civil servant, working honestly in Silverlight City, living an ordinary life."

###chapter 120 Love and Hate

Frank added, "I couldn't understand when you said you didn't want to be a screenwriter and wanted to find a regular job. Your talent shouldn't be wasted at the Forestry Bureau. You are an excellent spiritual leader, but being a spiritual leader and a leader are different. You are not suited to be a leader, even Nancy is more suitable than you. So, I can't understand what your purpose is. To get a salary? To work? To just get by?"

Frank had been in business for many years and had seen all kinds of people. He was confident in his ability to judge people and had a masterful grasp of human nature. He could even tell a person's character from an unintentional small gesture.

But he couldn't understand Alan and why he did that.

Carrying so much hatred and repression, he should be like a spring compressed to the extreme, bursting out with earth-shattering power, not living the life of a minor character.

Fate didn't give him the chance to be ordinary. He couldn't just lie there motionless, wasting his life like a useless person.

Frank continued, "I thought you would become a great screenwriter, a famous writer, with your name known throughout Silverlight City and even nationwide. You would be the prodigy of this era, a brilliant star in the history of literature. You always remember the past shame and disgrace!"

Frank became more and more excited, clenching his fist tightly. His jaw clenched and his face contorted as he said, "Then, you would take back everything that fate took from you! Every single thing, with interest!"

As soon as he finished speaking, Frank started coughing violently. Perhaps it was due to his excessive emotions, his pale face flushed with some color, but it was not a sign of health. On the contrary, it seemed he was really nearing the end of his life.

He had started coughing up blood.

Alan's face was full of sorrow and pity as he watched his old friend suffer, his heart aching.

Alan asked, "Stopped the medication?"

Frank coughed and nodded shakily, and it took him a while to catch his breath and speak smoothly again.

Alan said, "Frank... stop it, there's still a chance to turn back. The murder case at the Entertainment Club, there's still a chance for everything."

Frank retorted, "What are you talking about? Surrender? Who? Me? Why should I surrender?"

Frank said incredulously, pointing at Alan and then at his chest, his eyes wide open.

Frank shouted, "You, me, Tom, Joseph, Lally, Laura, Bob, Duke, and Mike who was killed a few days ago, what did we do wrong? Why were we born without parents, why did we live in the old steel mill being sold like goods? We are human beings!"

"Did those people ever give us a chance? When we begged, when we cried, when Tom had an eye gouged out and screamed, when Bob was tied up like a dog for drug testing, when Lally was gang-raped by a group of men, when Duke was lured into drug addiction, did they ever show any mercy?"

"Mercy... forget it... Alan, you've read too many books and become foolish. Even being a good person has its limits. Open your eyes and look, this is a world where the strong prey on the weak. Your so-called love and peace, your so-called mercy, will only get you eaten! Haven't you learned enough from your experiences?"

"Why should we let them go? Forgiving them is God's business, I'm responsible for sending them to meet God!"

Frank looked at Alan incredulously as if he was meeting him for the first time today. How could words like forgiveness and forgetfulness come out of his mouth? He wanted to stand up and grab Alan by the collar and beat him up, just like when they were young.

But he couldn't get up. He was a cripple, a dying man. But he knew that the flames of hatred would consume all evil. He didn't care whether it would backfire on him.

Alan said calmly, "They're already dead, we've seen their heads."

Frank replied, "They're dead, but what about Ronald and the people behind him? Do you think the old steel mill was blatantly operating in the suburbs without anyone noticing? That area was under Ronald's jurisdiction when he was a cop. Ronald had long been in cahoots with these people. What help? Someone thought that the old steel mill was no longer important, so Ronald killed those people."

Frank added, "How did George die? Laura was only seven or eight years old back then, just trying to survive. What did she do wrong? Why do these people only know shallow revenge and not look at the real evil in this world!"

Frank waved his fists, baring his teeth in the wheelchair like an old wolf about to die.

Alan said, "Hatred can blind you, and so can love. Frank, when Laura and Douglas cooperated with Ronald to frame Mr. Thompson, didn't you know?"

Alan slowly closed his eyes and continued, "You knew that you always liked sticking to Laura since you were young. When talking to us, you couldn't go three sentences without mentioning Laura. You haven't given up that naive love for over twenty years."

"Back then, to frame Mr. Thompson, Douglas went first, then Laura. It was Ronald's test for them. Laura won and lured Mr. Thompson over, didn't she?"

"Laura hid the fact that she framed Mr. Thompson from everyone. Everyone thought it was Douglas, and you naturally believed your plan could continue. Douglas was killed in the fire, and you had arranged witnesses and prepared all the testimonies. Everyone's alibis were confirmed, leaving no loopholes. But you didn't expect Tony, Mrs. Thompson, Tom, and Lally to change their minds and report Laura."

Frank trembled with anger, his face gradually becoming contorted, gritting his teeth. "It's all because of you! You told them about Laura!"

"Frank..."Alan was about to say something but was interrupted by Frank.

Frank shouted, "Shut up! What do you know? How much suffering Laura endured, how much pain she went through. Do you think she wanted to become what she is today?"

Frank pointed at Alan, his lips trembling, his face twitching, and shouted with a sobbing voice.

"We were more miserable in Shadow City than in the old steel mill! You ran away, free and easy, and now you come here pretending to be a good person! Ronald didn't save us, he trained us to become what he wanted. Tom and I desperately learned to make money, and Laura learned to dance and perform, not as a hobby, not as a talent, but to serve those people. Do you know that? Joseph's estrogen medication never stopped until it ruined his body! What do you know? Looking at you makes me want to puke! Pretending to be a righteous person!"

###chapter 121 Anyone in the World Can Love Laura, Except Douglas!

The man in his thirties was sobbing uncontrollably. He choked up and forcefully poked his chest.

Frank shouted, "I! Frank! Personally handed Laura over to others for their amusement. What could I do? I was just a teenager. Have you ever heard the most heart-wrenching cry? We couldn't defy Ronald. I could only endure, step by step. From that moment, I knew the world had collapsed. This world wouldn't get better. All the evils were clawing at me, and I was powerless to change anything!"

"Ronald finally ascended to his high position, like a vampire draining our blood! That day, I understood that power and wealth were the only ways to self-redemption!"

"I worked desperately hard, tried to please Ronald, studied and made money. I wanted to be a big shot. I wanted everyone to take me seriously. I wanted the person I love to live freely forever, without fearing any power. If she wanted to live in a stage play, then she would live! I would do everything for her. If she wanted to be a queen, then she would be! She could do everything she wanted. Whatever she wanted to get, it was what she deserved!"

"I want freedom, I want power, I want to return the pain I experienced to this world tenfold. I want this world to be buried with me! Ronald must die! Even if Jesus comes, it won't change my mind!"

Sitting in the flames of hatred for a long time, the burning pain made him no longer numb, always keeping him awake. One day, he exhausted all his blood and tears.

Frank continued, "I'm really afraid of dying. Things are not done yet. I can't die, but I don't want to live either. Every day when I open my eyes, the memories of the past gnaw at me like evil spirits. I'm tired of this world... What should I do?"

Alan lowered his head and said nothing.

Frank said, "A long time ago, you said, it doesn't matter what the world is like, what matters is how the world looks in your eyes. I took it as the truth of life. Whenever I was in pain, I would think of your words. Would it be better if I looked at the world from a different perspective?"

Frank slumped in his wheelchair as if the words he just said had exhausted all his energy. He stared blankly at the ceiling, the tear stains at the corners of his eyes already dry. He slowly lowered his head, looked at Alan, and said firmly, "You are wrong. The world is right there. It is already rotten to the core. What I need to do is to hold a funeral for this world and welcome the arrival of a new world!"

The room fell into silence, so quiet that even a pin drop could be heard.

Frank, like a dead man, slumped in his wheelchair motionless, his slightly heaving chest indicating that there was still a breath of life. Alan, who hadn't spoken for a long time, stared blankly at the corner of the wall, his eyes red. He wiped his tears intermittently and occasionally let out a sigh.

Alan said in a deep voice, "I'm sorry, Frank. Bob and Mike had mentioned your experiences in Shadow City more than once. The period in Shadow City was not much different from the old steel mill. It seemed like you were free, you could go to school, had a place to live, and could eat well, but Ronald's control over you became increasingly extreme."

Frank retorted, "So what did you do? Write a few letters, say some lukewarm words, and Mike, Bob, and even Laura believe you? I really don't know why. What kind of magic do you have that makes everyone lean towards you?"

Frank glanced at Alan and sneered. "I was the one charging ahead, I was the one making plans, I was the one busy with work after graduation. They had no gratitude, only memories of you. Lally and Tom, fine, you lived together for a long time. But why Bob, Mike, and Laura?"

Alan replied, "You're jealous. I have no feelings for Laura."

Hearing Laura's name, Frank's eyes twitched, not hiding his jealousy and anger at all.

Frank continued, "That's right, I'm jealous of you! Why does everyone listen to you, but not care about what I say? Alan, do you think you're so great? You couldn't win fights as a kid, always the last to grab things. If it weren't for me helping you, you would have been beaten to death long ago. After graduation, you hid in your little nest like a dog, drinking coffee, and reading newspapers and your poems all day. Why? Why does everyone like you, but what about me? Has anyone ever acknowledged me?"

"Where did I go wrong? I led everyone in revenge. Tom wanted to go into business, and I helped him with all my might, but in the end, he conspired with Tammy, Lally, and Tony to harm Laura behind my back?"

"Yes, Laura is guilty, but isn't Ronald the main culprit? A few years ago, when I was making this plan, Tony and Tom spent money to buy insurance for Tammy. To compensate, I also put money in, but Tom didn't even look at it and said no! He dared to refuse me! Why? Because of you!"

"That bastard Duke would have died from drug addiction if I hadn't helped him. Lally is such a good girl, I can now give her a decent job. After two years of training, I can even give her a company. She said she didn't want it. Why? Also because of you!"

"Laura... Laura always thought of you. Even when I was with her, I knew she still thought of you. No matter what she did later, I accepted it completely as long as it made her happy. Even if she slept with other men, I wouldn't hesitate. But I couldn't accept that she thought of you!"

"Tell me, Alan, compared to you, what am I lacking? Ability, money, power, you can have them all. Tell me."

Frank stared at Alan with an almost pleading look and grabbed his arm tightly.

"Frank, you are becoming more and more like Ronald." Alan looked at Frank's almost crazy actions with sadness and said tremblingly.

Frank was stunned for a moment as if he had thought of something and said no more.

Alan continued, "I always thought that you were stronger than me. Or rather, we shouldn't talk about strength between us. You have been competitive since childhood and have many ideas, not showing your emotions on your face. Maybe that's why Ronald chose you among so many children."

"It hasn't been easy for us to come this far. You are the most successful among us. How could the brothers and sisters not be grateful or acknowledge you? But Frank, you only said what you were willing to say."

"Frank, Joseph is already married. Why did you place him with a big shot in the state? This wasn't Ronald's idea, but yours. That high-ranking official was your tool to bring down Ronald, wasn't he?"

"The investor behind the Sand Village demolition case is Laura, that's true. But who are the shareholders behind Laura? You knew that Tony's family lived in Sand Village. The Thompson family once did you a favor. To please Laura, you organized thugs to cause trouble, making Tony lose his ability to have children. This can't be ended with just a word of compensation. You and Laura owe the Thompson family a lot."

"When you sent Joseph, did you think about how you felt when you sent Laura? You didn't. You only thought that Joseph did what he was supposed to do. When you secretly ordered the demolition of Sand Village, you didn't think about the difficulties of the Thompson family because you thought no one would know about it."

Frank's eyes widened, shaking his head slightly, looking at Alan in disbelief.

Frank said, "No... no... how do you know... all these years you've been investigating me. I understand now. No wonder Nancy could investigate all the way. You arranged it in advance. You gave her the hints. Alan, you're so scheming!"

Alan replied, "Frank, using the word 'scheming' on me makes me very sad."

Alan added, "Douglas was greedy, insidious, cunning, and brutal. He was bad, but he was sincere to Laura. Did you kill Douglas for revenge or for Laura?"

Frank started laughing, the laughter growing louder, almost maniacal!

Frank sneered, "What is sincerity? That poem?"

"If I say I love you, I will love your past, your unreasonable behavior, your flaws."

"If I say I love you, I will offer my heart, lungs, and all my organs to the god of love who has fallen into hell."

"If I say I love you, I will drain my blood, leaving only my skin to wrap your soul, avoiding the pursuit of death."

"If I say I love you, you and I will kiss passionately, tongues entwined, bodies merging, a fire dissolving sin and pain."

"We will eventually meet."

"Haha, does he deserve it? Alan, let me tell you, this poem was given to Laura by Douglas. How he wrote it is how he died!"

Alan's face changed dramatically, staring at Frank in a daze.

Alan asked, "You did it?"

Frank replied, "No... you wouldn't guess who."

Frank laughed even more happily, then said seriously, "Anyone in the world can love Laura, except Douglas!"

###chapter 122 Fatal Weakness

Shadow City.

Ronald ultimately did not fire the gun. The moment Zoey shouted "Dad," his hand holding the gun slowly lowered.

I had imagined what Ronald's expression would be when Zoey appeared. Would it be the terror of owing Zoey, or the guilt of a father whose image had collapsed?

None of that.

It was the love of a father for his daughter, the unbearable feeling of being in the same city but not seeing each other for years, or the panic of being discovered by his daughter for who he really was. It was like when a father suddenly raised his voice and scared his child, then quickly came over to gently comfort them.

In short, the moment Ronald saw Zoey, it was as if he saw her suddenly return home. With his eager eyes and gentle smile, as he threw the cigarette butt on the ground, he smiled and said, "Zoey, you're here. Don't worry, this has nothing to do with you. You are my daughter."

Ronald quickly calmed down and looked at Zoey for a long time.

He smiled and said, "I understand. Nancy won't die. She is your mentor. Your growth today is largely due to her, so she won't die. George is an old friend of mine. He didn't die over twenty years ago, maybe it's fate. Whether he lives or dies today depends on his luck. Bob, you are my adopted son. Do you acknowledge this?"

Bob showed a hint of fear, hesitated for a moment, and slowly nodded.

Ronald continued, "Good. Let me ask you, in the arson and murder case at the True Love Entertainment Club in November, do you know where Frank was and what his purpose was?"

Bob didn't speak. Somehow, he found the courage to straighten his chest and looked directly at Ronald with a resolute expression.

He didn't speak, but the meaning was clear.

Ronald said, "Alright, I misjudged you."

Ronald looked at Bob with a half-smile, not knowing what he was thinking, and said, "Among you all, you were the most timid since childhood, but I appreciate your attitude today. Like a man. Are you certain that because my daughter is here, I won't dare to shoot?"

Bob shook his head and said, "No, you would shoot at any time. No one in this world can threaten you."

Ronald turned his head and listened, sighed, and looked at Zoey across from him. She never came over, no longer like before, giving him a big hug when they met. He felt a pang of loss and sighed, "I also thought I would be like that, but I didn't expect things to change."

As he spoke, his lowered hand slowly rose, the gun pointed directly at Bob.

Bob remained unmoved, without a trace of fear on his face, in contrast to earlier. He faced Ronald calmly as if he was facing his destiny.

"Do you hate me?" Ronald suddenly asked.

It seemed like a very childish and somewhat shameless question. Ronald thought the harm he caused to these kids at the old steel mill was worse, but this question suddenly made Bob silent.

Bob replied, "It's a shallow question. If I say I hate you, without you, we would all be dead, either starved or overdosed. There would be no good outcome."

"But if I say I don't hate you, then we are just animals, not humans. You made us live the way you wanted, under the guise of nurturing and gratitude, stripping us of our right to choose. We are like vessels for your will and values, more like puppets with strings in your hands. I hate this feeling, and so does everyone else."

Ronald lowered his eyes, listening carefully. After a while, he responded.

Then he put the gun away and looked at Zoey with deep affection.

He said, "Zoey. Promise me one thing, you must live on your own, not depend on others, and not be used by others. For example, this time, you were actually used by your mother and Howard. Even though they meant well for you, as your father, I still feel angry. Not because they set me up, but because they tricked you into doing something impure."

I frowned slightly, glanced at Zoey, thought for a moment, and roughly understood what was going on.

"A few days ago, I called Howard and told him not to get you out of Silverlight City no matter what.  I knew that Howard took your car and Erica froze your bank card. But now I realize, they did it for me to see. They know you too well. You would definitely follow and see this scene. Thus, my fatal weakness would be exposed."

Sure enough, I was right.

Howard and Erica, one took the car, the other froze the bank card. The more excessive their actions, the more they attracted Zoey, forcing her to come to Shadow City to find me. After finding me, she would inevitably discover Ronald's true nature.

They knew that no one in this world could truly defeat Ronald, but there was one person who could instantly collapse all his carefully laid plans over the years.

That person was his daughter, Zoey.

The daughter who didn't share his last name, who lived in the same city but hadn't seen him for years, became the only remaining part of his humanity.

"Whenever you want to settle accounts, come find me. I also want to see how far you've grown." Ronald threw down a sentence and went downstairs without looking back.

Bob was drenched in sweat as if he had gone through a life-and-death struggle. He steadied himself and hurriedly ran over to check on the barely conscious George.

Fortunately, the knife was small and not long, and the place it was inserted was some distance from George's heart. Even so, the elderly George couldn't bear it, his consciousness gradually fading; no matter how much he was called, he didn't respond.

I held Zoey's hand while quickly calling the hospital.

Fortunately, the hospital was not far from here, and the ambulance arrived in less than ten minutes.

Including the accompanying doctors and nurses, there were clearly not enough seats for all of us. Bob and Shirley went with George to the hospital first, and Zoey and I took a cab to follow closely behind.

Since Ronald left, Zoey's state was a bit off.

She didn't react like other girls, after seeing their hero-like father turn into a ruthless killer, and felt a huge psychological gap, unbearable pain, and emotional breakdown.

Nor did she, as usual, argue logically, continuously analyzing the details of the case and sharing her thoughts, after all, it was her biological father.

She didn't stay silent, nor was she like a wooden person, slow to grasp things. When assisting the doctors in carrying George, she always ran to the front, constantly thanking the doctors and nurses, and begging them to save George.

When the doctor saw Zoey not getting in the car, he asked, "Isn't your daughter coming?"

###chapter 123 Atonement

"Nancy, are you hungry? I'll go get you something to eat."

"Nancy, were you scared just now?"

In the taxi, Zoey kept asking, almost incessantly.

Zoey felt deeply guilty; she felt she owed everyone and took all of Ronald's mistakes upon herself.

I looked at her, my heart aching.

"Nancy, is Alan... also my dad..."

She stopped halfway, turned around, and looked out the window.

She had already started to choke up, her shoulders trembling slightly.

I replied, "It's not your fault, Zoey."

"It's not your fault. He is him, and you are you. It's different. You can be in pain, disappointed, sad, and even cry to vent, but you don't need to, nor should you, take his mistakes upon yourself."

I placed my hand on her shoulder and patted it gently. Her shoulders trembled even more.

She must have been in tears, but she didn't want me to see it. In this situation, she really wanted to be alone for a while but couldn't.

Zoey said, "When I was little, I rarely saw him. He came home very late. I asked my mom where Dad was, and she said he was out catching bad guys. So I waited until he came back and put the little red flower the school awarded me on his chest, saying, 'Dad, you're awesome.' I still remember how happy he was when he hugged me. He was really happy, and he wore it on his chest every time he came home."

"As I grew older, my parents divorced. I didn't understand what divorce meant at the time. Mr. Martin said it was the end of their relationship, and they would use the time they spent in their relationship to love me even more. From then on, I would receive two New Year gifts every year."

"Mr. Martin was good at talking and comforting me, but I knew I no longer had a home. My parents were always busy, and I hated the fake smiles of the nannies they hired. I felt they were all bought with money, and I didn't like it. I wanted to live at Mr. Martin's house, but I always felt that my own home was better. From the day they divorced, my home in my heart was gone, like a building that should have collapsed long ago, collapsing completely when I was eight."

Zoey spoke with increasing sobs, her back to me, constantly wiping her tears.

She continued, "I try to think positively, Nancy. I'm an optimistic person. Mr. Martin said he was raising a daughter for my parents and that I should just call him dad. I strongly opposed it, not because I didn't have feelings for Mr. Martin. On the contrary, I would blur the line between these two men even more. Mr. Martin became more like my dad, while my dad became a familiar yet strange uncle. I couldn't betray my dad. I used to be Zoey Carter, but after my parents divorced, my mom made me change my last name to Taylor. My opposition was ineffective, and it was forcibly changed. Now, even the father-daughter relationship is gradually being lost. I feel guilty and reluctant towards him in my heart."

"Nancy, in my heart, he is a hero, a real man who has walked through fire and water without fear, who has solved big cases with his own skills step by step. I really miss him. I call him from time to time, but he's always busy. He says a few words and then hangs up. I know he loves me in his heart. I've thought it through. I'll earn money seriously. He probably hasn't saved much for retirement. I'll buy him a house, cook for him from time to time, and make up for everything I owe him."

Zoey spoke while crying. How could she not understand that coming to Shadow City was a deliberate arrangement by Howard and Erica?

Should she hate them? This wasn't about smearing Ronald but letting Zoey see the scene, seeing Ronald's ferocity, his disregard for life, and his madness.

Bob was right; no one in this world could make Ronald truly compromise. A young man withoutbackground had worked his way up to the state police department. No one could change his unwavering determination, and his desire for power.Except for his daughter.

The moment his daughter appeared, his hand holding the gun relaxed.

This was his only weakness.

Ronald didn't know that, but Howard and Erica did. So even at the risk, they entrusted Zoey to me. Only Zoey could stop him.

Just like Ronald told Zoey, never rely on anyone, never let anyone use her, even with good intentions.

Because, at that moment, Ronald realized that it was all Howard and Erica's plan.

However, Howard and Erica hoped he would let go of his obsession and stop the killing.

But Ronald's understanding was anger at being manipulated. I was a bit worried about Howard's situation.

At that moment, my phone rang. Howard had sent a message:

[Nancy, I'm sorry.]

It seemed Ronald had already contacted Howard.

[Why apologize?]

I fully understood. This was the real reason Howard was so invested in this case from the beginning. He and Erica might have known about Ronald's various actions long ago. They even knew from the start that Ronald was behind the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case.

He couldn't persuade Ronald, and it was impossible to send him to prison because of their relationship and Zoey, as well as Ronald's status. He could only help me and guide me to uncover the truth.

I wouldn't blame Howard for hiding these things. On the contrary, I was very grateful to him. In this world, no one was obligated to help you. If someone helped you, it was a favor, but not a duty. He always acted out of goodwill, not for any other purpose.

Howard replied concisely:

[Zoey, Shadow City.]

I sighed and replied:

[Only Zoey can stop Ronald in this world. Be careful over there. Ronald probably won't appreciate it.]

[Got it.]

The ones who should be most heartbroken were Howard and Erica. One was her biological mother, and the other was, in a sense, another father to Zoey. With so many years of feelings, they took such a big risk to let Zoey stop her biological father. From the moment Zoey got on the train, their hearts had been tense.

From another perspective, they did it for Ronald too.

This was the bond between the three of them.

Unfortunately, Ronald never thought of this, and perhaps he never would.

Zoey's appearance only pressed the pause button. It didn't mean Ronald wouldn't wake up again. I had a feeling Ronald wouldn't let this go easily.

###chapter 124 Arrested

When we were almost at the hospital, Leonard called.

He sounded very anxious, asking where I was and if I had encountered Ronald.

I briefly told him what had happened that day. He let out a long sigh on the other end of the line, fell silent, and then told me some big internal news.

This afternoon, the news came that the state Public Security Department Minister had been taken in for questioning. It was still an internal investigation, but if there wasn't solid evidence, they wouldn't have made such a big move.

One of the charges against him was participating in child trafficking over twenty years ago. This wasn't just about being a protector of criminal organizations; he was actually involved.

At that time, he wasn't the state Public Security Department Minister yet, just the deputy director of the Silverlight City Public Security Bureau, and Ronald was his direct subordinate.

The strangest part was, when I asked who reported him, I instinctively thought of Frank, Tom, and others, but Leonard said that the anonymous report was actually sent by Ronald three years ago. The evidence was very clear, and he had completely removed himself from the situation.

If nothing unexpected happened, Ronald would be the best candidate for the next state Public Security Department Minister. He was a renowned criminal investigation expert nationwide.

But something unexpected did happen. Someone reported Ronald anonymously a few months ago.

The state prosecutor's technical department traced the IP address of the anonymous report email to the Silverlight City Forestry Bureau.

Not long after, another anonymous report about Ronald appeared, and the IP address was traced to Frank's house.

These two reports were not made public but were secretly investigated by the state prosecutor's office. Recently, some information was released, making Ronald feel uneasy. Because of this, he attempted to assassinate Benjamin several times without success and then caused a car accident before Benjamin entered Silverlight City, intending to kill him.

At the same time, he went to Shadow City to kill Mike and then came to kill Bob. Unexpectedly, George, whom he had intended to kill, was still alive.

Initially, he thought Mike and Bob had exposed the secret and wanted to kill them, but it turned out that all the children from back then seemed to have come together to challenge him.

Of course, this was nothing to him. After so many years of planning, as long as he pulled the trigger, he could eliminate Bob and George, the key figures.

But he never expected Zoey to appear.

She was the turning point in all of this. Ronald's ex-wife and best friend used his biological daughter as a bet to stop him.

But from his expression, there was no sign of panic. Even the reason he stopped was very much in line with his style as if it was all a divine gift. He was like a god, with others' lives and deaths in his hands.

He stopped, but that didn't mean he was giving up.

It was far from over.

The taxi stopped at the hospital entrance. I called Bob to ask for the location of the operating room and hurried up with Zoey.

Bob was sitting outside the operating room. Shirley was holding his arm and constantly comforted him.

When he saw us coming, Bob stood up with red eyes, opening his mouth but not knowing what to say.

From what I knew of him, he probably wanted to say that he hadn't told me George was still alive. After all, he knew I had found Tony's family in Sand Village and knew about the relationship between the Thompson family and Alan.

"How is it?" I asked.

Bob said gloomily. "He was sent into the operating room. The wound was treated simply in the car. The knife didn't hit the heart, but based on the bleeding, the doctor suspects bone fragments might have pierced an organ. But we'll have to wait for the doctor's final conclusion."

I continued, "What about you?"

I looked at Bob. He had walked on the edge of life and death today, and I was worried about his mental state. We couldn't afford any more problems now.

Bob shook his head, took a deep breath, and said calmly, "I'm fine. No more avoiding it. Let's face it directly while I'm still sane."

He glanced at Zoey and said sincerely, "Don't blame yourself. This has nothing to do with you. He is he, and you are you. You don't need to feel this way. Besides, if it weren't for you, we might all be dead now."

Zoey forced a smile and secretly wiped her tears. "Thank you, Mr. Moore."

Bob waved his hand, signaling us to sit down and wait for news.

Not long after, the doctor came out of the operating room.

"The patient's condition is good. Although there was a lot of bleeding, fortunately, the heart, liver, and lungs were not damaged. It was just arterial bleeding, which has been stopped. However, considering the patient's age and the significant blood loss, he is still in a coma and may need some time to recuperate."

The doctor took off his mask and wiped his sweat, clearly relieved.

"How long until he wakes up?"I asked quickly.

Anna had forced Tammy to drink pesticide, leaving her in a coma for over half a month, and I was worried George might be the same.

The doctor replied, "If he's lucky, by tomorrow morning. However, the patient needs to rest and can't have too much emotional stress. If you want to talk to him, I suggest waiting a while."

The doctor looked at me, probably thinking this injury wasn't accidental, but as a doctor, he didn't ask more, assuming I was a police officer, so he explained patiently.

As soon as he finished speaking, George was wheeled out and transferred to the intensive care unit.

Family members weren't allowed in the ICU, so we could only wait outside.

Too much had happened that day. It was already around 2 AM, and none of us had eaten all day. Bob asked Shirley to see if there was anything to eat around the hospital.

Zoey wanted to go with Shirley, but I stopped her. Since we knew some things, there was no need to avoid them. As Bob said, what needed to be faced would eventually have to be faced. If we hid forever, this matter would never be resolved.

"Bob, tell me about what happened in Shadow City. Earlier, I heard Ronald say he was your foster father. What does that mean? What's the relationship between you all? There's no need to hide anything now. Ronald's backer has been taken away for investigation."

I said, also sharing the information Leonard had told me on the phone.

This was to encourage him and give him the confidence to tell the truth. I needed to make it clear that Ronald was now at a dead end, with no way out.

###chapter 125 Howard's Suspicion

Bob replied, "What do you want to hear?"

Bob leaned against the corner of the wall, staring blankly at the ceiling with empty, despairing eyes. He chuckled a few times and murmured, "My life is full of failures, or even calling it a failure is a huge compliment. How should I put it? I thought that over twenty years ago the leash around my neck had been taken off. But it turns out, the leash has always been around my neck."

He continued, "I have two selves, like night and day. During the day, the sun is scorching, passionate, and full of endless energy. That optimism and passion make others think I'm a fool, but that version of me doesn't care about others' opinions at all. Dance is me, and I am dance. Following the rhythm of the music, like the lines of a painting. I am showcasing, I am flaunting, I am rebelling against the mundane life and the mediocre people."

"If my daytime self sees the whole world as a stage, then my nighttime self is like a lonely ghost crawling out of a grave in the wilderness. I fear the light. My heart is so small, like the size of a pigeon egg, unable to bear anything. I am sensitive and fragile. Even the slightest thing can depress me for a long time. On the bustling streets, I feel terrified. I am like a bug trampled by wild beasts in the forest. They don't care about me at all, but I desperately build a ridiculous nest, hiding in fear..."

Two such split personalities, like two completely opposite people forcibly pieced together into one, pulling back and forth between excitement and despair. It was already lucky that he hadn't gone mad.

I had researched schizophrenia, and it was very likely to continue splitting until the patient can no longer distinguish between reality and dreams, unable to tell who they really were, and eventually choosing suicide under the mental collapse.

"Mrs. Smith... Mr. Moore."

Zoey pursed her lips, glanced at me, and softly said, "My mom knows a famous psychiatrist abroad. After this is over, I'll help you get in touch. You will definitely get better..."

Bob was about to say something, but I stopped him.

"It's settled then, Bob. This is also Zoey's kind gesture, so just accept it."

I looked at Zoey and nodded.

Bob smiled bitterly. "We'll talk about it later. As for the details of the Entertainment Club murder case, to be honest, I can't remember. I might even end up in jail."

I said slowly. "No, I always feel that the person who did it shouldn't be you."

The victim of the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case had been confirmed as Douglas. Frank wanted to kill Douglas, and Tony, Tammy, Lally, and Tom were targeting Laura, while Frank was also trying to protect Laura. The motive was very clear.

Frank, Laura, Bob, Mike, Tom, and Joseph wanted to kill Douglas for revenge. The plan was carried out in an orderly manner, and after the Entertainment Club fire, Douglas was killed, and his organs were dissected and hung in a private room for a short time.

The killer had to kill Douglas in a short time and needed to be extremely skilled in dissection, extracting all the organs within minutes and hanging them in the room. From the dissection of the body, the wounds were smooth, without mistakes, indicating that the killer was likely someone proficient in anatomy.

The most reasonable guess for this person was Joseph.

Moreover, there was another doubt. Joseph was a forensic pathologist for the court. On a day when all police forensic pathologists were on duty and had no work arrangements, it was unreasonable to temporarily assign a court forensic pathologist to the police station for an autopsy.

More importantly, why did Joseph, knowing the deceased was not Alan, still conclude in the autopsy report that it was Alan, hiding Douglas's identity?

Now that I thought about it, there were two reasons.

First, Alan was already detained by Frank at that time. He came to hint to me that there was a problem with the case, leading me to gradually uncover the truth of the past;

Second, declaring Alan dead was also to confuse Ronald, in a sense, protecting Alan.

This fully indicated that Joseph and Ronald were definitely not on the same side. At least in this matter, Joseph had his ideas.

So, this reduced the likelihood of Joseph being the one who acted. Then who could be the one who killed Douglas?

Could it be someone else present?

It's unlikely. Tammy and Tony had no direct conflict with Douglas. Tom was the adopted son of Tammy and George. Douglas harmed Tom back then, locking him in a dark room and gouging out one of his eyes, causing Tom to fear the dark even now.

But... this didn't seem enough for Tammy and Lally to kill Douglas.

I couldn't figure it out. I didn't know what happened, but one thing was certain. These people did not follow Frank's plan. Instead, after Douglas's death, they all turned their attention to Laura.

So what was Frank's real purpose? Tony's text said Frank went mad, and the revenge was not over. At that time, I guessed Frank might be launching a counterattack against the old forces of the old steel mill. Later, I gradually found out that the people from the old steel mill had long been killed by Ronald, and Ronald continued to control these children in Shadow City.

From the moment I saw Ronald today, I suddenly understood that Frank's real target might be Ronald.

Ronald was still setting up a stall near the Entertainment Club that day if nothing went wrong.

But Frank had an alibi because I asked Howard to check on Frank at that time, and he said Frank was still abroad that day and only returned to Silverlight City the day after Alan's incident.

Howard and Frank had a very good relationship. At the same time, Howard and Ronald were very close, while Frank and Ronald had an unresolvable hatred.

I subconsciously glanced at Zoey, and a very terrifying thought emerged in my mind.

The news that Frank was not in Silverlight City might be false. Howard intentionally hid it. This matter might also had an unclear relationship with Howard.

Because with such a big plan, Frank couldn't possibly control it remotely.

With his character and hatred for Ronald, if he didn't kill Ronald himself, what would be the point of dragging his half-dead body?

"Bob, you forgot whether you acted or not. Do you still remember where Frank was at that time?" I asked suddenly.

Bob nodded and said in a deep voice, "He was always there. He was the one who led this matter and notified each of us."

"What did he mainly do that day?" I asked.

Bob replied, "Persuading Alan, stalling him, not letting him intervene."

###chapter 126 Rebellion

"Hold him back?" I asked in surprise. 

It seemed my suspicion was correct; when Frank planned the True Love Entertainment Club murder, he didn't include Alan and kept it a secret from him.

He replied, "Yes, Alan somehow found out about it."

Bob opened his mouth, his eyes flickering with doubt as if this was unexpected to him. He continued, "This was very unexpected. From what happened that night, it seemed like he had known about it for a long time."

I asked, "Could it be that someone among you leaked the information, like Lally, Tony, or Tom?"

Lally, Tony, and Tom clearly had deeper feelings for Alan. From our previous conversations, their admiration for Alan was evident. Their goal this time wasn't Douglas but for Laura.

Bob replied, "No. Anyone could have told Alan, except those few."

Bob shook his head and said solemnly, "If they had told him, given Alan's status in their eyes, the plan would have been stopped before it even started. This is a matter of life and death, and any mistake could land them in prison. They definitely wouldn't have told him. Besides, their ultimate target was Laura, not Douglas..."

"What happened next? What was Alan's attitude? What did he say?" I asked urgently.

Bob said, "I can't remember."

Bob held his head, looking pained. It seemed the incident in November had caused him great distress.

Bob added, "I only remember Frank loudly asking who told Alan. He couldn't stop Alan. Alan seemed very anxious to find Laura, and it looked like they argued. I really can't remember what happened after that."

Why was Frank so angry that Alan knew about this? Was it because he didn't want Alan to know, or did Frank feel betrayed?

Who could have told him?

On the other hand, could it be that Alan knew them well enough to figure out the plan during their conversations?

That didn't make sense. I didn't see them at my wedding with Alan, and in the ten years we've been married, Alan never mentioned their names. Alan's social life was quite simple; he came home after work every day and informed me of any plans in advance. It was unlikely they had any contact.

Moreover, Tony mentioned that after Alan got married, he rarely contacted them. They all hoped Alan could start anew, live the life he wanted, and leave behind the nightmares of his childhood.

"What about Joseph? How much do you know about him?" I asked.

Joseph was the first to reveal the case to me. He was the one who initially misidentified Douglas's body as Alan's. I suspected Alan might have had contact with him.

"Joseph?"

Bob was taken aback and said, "That's possible. Among us, Joseph seemed the most gentle and easy to talk to. We even suspected he had taken too much estrogen, affecting his personality. He hid it well. Back at the old steel mill, he was younger than us and not as familiar. It wasn't until we got to Shadow City that we got to know him better."

"He continued taking estrogen in Shadow City until he was 18 and saw no effect, so he stopped," Bob added, his voice tinged with admiration.

Indeed, on the night of the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder, the Joseph I saw was different from the youthful, delicate boy in college. He had gained some weight, cut his hair into a Butch Cut, wore a black jacket, and smoked a cigarette, looking like a weathered middle-aged man.

The Sand Village group had one idea, Frank had another, and Joseph had his own. These people seemed close, but they each had their plans.

What was Joseph's plan? Why did he endure a relationship with the leader without speaking out?

When he asked me to find Ronald, I initially thought he wanted to reveal the truth through Ronald. But in reality, he wanted me to see the truth behind Ronald.

When I first learned Ronald was the mastermind, I suspected Joseph. Did he want me to see Ronald's true nature or help Ronald uncover Bob's secrets?

But I believed that each of these former children had a seed of rebellion planted in their hearts.

Rebellion against Ronald's control as a "foster father," the fate imposed on them, and their own painful experiences. Whether it was Tony, Lally, Tom, or Bob, or the crazy Frank and Laura, they each tried to change their circumstances through their efforts. They sought revenge and release, almost to the point of obsession and madness. This was a form of silent rebellion.

Joseph was no different.

"Tell me about your experiences in Shadow City." I took a deep breath and said slowly.

I had already warned Howard to be more careful. Whether Howard and Frank were in cahoots was no longer important. Ronald was already at the end of his rope and would surely launch a fierce counterattack. Frank was definitely waiting for him.

Alan's current whereabouts were surely under Frank's control.

But one thing I couldn't figure out. Why had Ronald been lurking around the Entertainment Club for years, watching that small building? Why didn't he go inside?

What was in the Entertainment Club that made him so fearful?

Bob said, "Shadow City, it's like a graveyard for time-desolate, remote, bleak, and closed off. The people inside seemed content, living peacefully as if they were living in another world. Outsiders seemed to have forgotten this small city. Many didn't even know Shadow City existed. When a place is too far removed from memory, evil quietly grows."

"On the night of the old steel mill fire, we were on our way to Sand Village to find Alan when Ronald stopped us. He was smoking at the roadside. I'll never forget that scene. After the fire, we were ecstatic. It was an opportunity given by fate. Frank quickly devised an escape plan and route. Only then did I realize he had been planning the escape route for a long time. We unanimously decided to go to Sand Village to find Alan and Tom."

###chapter 127 Viper

Bob said, "But Frank objected."

"Why?" I asked.

Bob continued, "Frank said at the time that if so many people went to Sand Village, it would cause too much commotion and easily attract attention."

I asked, "But you were the victims, why would you be discovered?"

Bob replied, "You're right, we were thinking the same thing at the time, but as the situation grew more intense, we decided to run first. Unexpectedly, Ronald seemed to know exactly where we were going and was waiting for us. It was the first time I felt powerless. When you clearly see the light of hope, it turns out to be the flickering of the devil's cigarette."

"We broke down. Joseph, who was a few years younger than us, collapsed on the ground and started crying. When he cried, all of us kids started crying. It was not only because we lost our freedom, but also because of Ronald's bloody appearance and those severed heads, which was terrifying."

The oldest of them was no more than ten years old. Just when they thought the years of torment were about to end and they were about to gain freedom, they fell into another cage.

This cage was no less than the old steel factory.

"What about Laura and Frank? How did they react?"

"What about Laura and Frank? How did they react?" I asked as these two were the most crucial among the kids. Their reactions to such a drastic change were directly related to the root of the conflict between Frank and Ronald.

Bob looked at me with some surprise, seemingly taken aback by my question.

"Frank and Laura didn't cry. Now that I think about it, I really admire Frank. A ten-year-old kid with such composure is indeed remarkable. No wonder he achieved great things later."

"They didn't cry?" I was surprised.

Bob replied, "No."

Bob shook his head and squinted his eyes, speaking slowly,"Frank stood in front of Laura and only said one word: 'Conditions.' I was still a kid then, and didn't even understand what 'conditions' meant. He could protect Laura behind him without asking why or begging for mercy, and he knew that Ronald waiting for us was premeditated. To be honest, every time I recall this, I feel a bit scared..."

I asked, "Why?"

Bob added, "I seemed to see another Ronald."

Bob looked at me with empty eyes and murmured, "When Frank said that word, Ronald threw away his cigarette. He looked at Frank as if he had found a treasure, rushed over, grabbed Frank's shoulder, and said: 'I see hatred and endurance in your eyes. That's what I value most about you. You are like another me. Of course, don't do this to me again, just this once.'"

Not only from what Bob just said but also from Ronald's own words, it was clear that he had an unusual admiration for Frank as if he were a disciple he had trained or a masterpiece he had created.

Bob continued, "He said he would take us to change our own destiny, where no one would bully us, no one would oppress us, and we would gain freedom. Freedom, what a long topic. It's been thirty years, and I still haven't figured it out."

In a trance, he seemed to have aged decades, his voice squeezing out from his throat.

"Our fate left one cage, and a few minutes later, we were shackled again. We had no choice but to entrust our fate to him. He gave us food and didn't let us freeze to death by the roadside. That was his grace. According to his plan, he shaped us into what he wanted, making us his tools to create his world. Were we bricks? Or sacrifices? I don't know..."

"Frank went into business to provide Ronald with influence in the business world. Tom went into financial investment, laundering the money Ronald embezzled. Joseph was constantly given female hormones by Ronald, who originally planned to turn Joseph into a complete plaything. When that failed, he had Joseph start learning anatomy to infiltrate the police, prosecution, and court systems from another angle."

"It sounds foolish and naive, but Frank achieved it step by step, or rather, we did!"

Bob hung his head, his nails subconsciously scratching the wall, his body pressed tightly against it. His lips were tightly pursed, then painfully opening as if he was tearing open a scabbed wound.

He was deeply resistant to these memories.

I said calmly, "It seems like you forgot to mention some people."

I didn't soften and let him stop recalling. Time was running out, and Ronald, driven to desperation, would surely launch a frenzied counterattack. I needed to quickly understand this information. Who was the real mastermind behind the Entertainment Club murder case? These things weighed heavily on Bob's mind and could be one of the triggers for his schizophrenia. If he didn't face it bravely, his condition might worsen.

Just like he told Ronald today, he would no longer run away; he would face it.

Bob replied, "Me? Mike and I were the most useless. We were very stupid and often got beaten. We didn't have the talents of Frank or Tom. We couldn't keep up with academic subjects, and we couldn't grasp even the basic concepts and accounts of business and finance. Mike was honest and did all the chores in our room. I was more lively, or maybe my mental state was already unstable, sometimes low, sometimes high. Once, when I saw Laura dancing, I joined in. I liked dancing, I liked art. Ronald said I should go dance with Laura."

"Dancing became my only spiritual solace. No matter how strong Ronald's control was, no matter what he did to us, every time I danced, I felt happy, forgetting everything, immersed in the world of the role, unable to extricate myself, even unable to distinguish between myself and the role."

Bob smiled slightly, looking a bit better than before.

"What about Laura?" I pressed on, as Bob seemed to deliberately avoid talking about Laura.

Bob added, "Laura... she's a viper."

"She's very beautiful, exceptionally beautiful. In the eyes of others, such beauty overshadowed everything else. If she bit you unintentionally, you would die instantly from the poison. Ronald said that only Laura and I had real artistic talent, but even artistic talent has levels. I had the talent of an ordinary person, while Laura defined the concept of talent. She was a lunatic, completely merging the roles in dramas with herself."

"Ronald had her sleep with men, and she went with a smile. She even came back excitedly talking about the wild excitement of sleeping with old men. Frank secretly wiped his tears, but she ignored it."

"So, Frank trained her to be a socialite?"

I asked with a frown, having experienced Laura's madness myself.

Bob replied, "No."

Bob shook his head with a bitter smile and said softly, "If she were a socialite, I wouldn't describe her as a viper. Laura was trained as a model for a special assassin. Over the years, who knows how many people have died at her hands."

###chapter 128 Friends and Competition

Bob continued, "I find it hard to imagine that someone like Laura exists in this world. People are shallow, or perhaps human nature is so, especially men. From a young age, they can't help but chat more with pretty girls. This is what I've observed. Even boys in elementary school feel proud to have a pretty girl as their deskmate."

"Douglas is like that. He's cruel, greedy, and moody. He's like the violent side of Ronald, showing no mercy to anyone. But from the moment he first saw Laura, he kept trying to please her, leaving the last bit of his humanity with her. No matter how much Laura disliked or teased him, he would just laugh foolishly. He hasn't changed since childhood."

"Frank is the same, though different from Douglas. He is more reserved, but his eyes don't lie. He really likes Laura, to the point of being jealous of everyone around her."

Bob slowly recalled.

"Frank said that he and Laura were together in college. Could the reason for their breakup be Douglas?"

I remembered Frank telling me about this. Perhaps the motive for killing Douglas wasn't just Ronald; there might be personal feelings involved.

Bob added, "They were indeed together in college. As for the reason, even though we were close, we didn't really know. We just made a fuss and asked Frank to treat us to a meal. As for the reason for their breakup, I have no idea. But after they broke up, our small group didn't fall apart. Their relationship remained the same as before. As for Douglas..."

Bob frowned, shook his head, and said, "Frank couldn't have been jealous of Douglas emotionally."

I asked, "Why?"

Bob replied, "Because Frank and Laura never saw him as a person. Or rather, Douglas himself thought he was Ronald's dog. He was proud of it because a dog with a master can bite people at will, while a dog without a master can only scavenge in the streets. He said this himself, not me."

I was stunned. Strictly speaking, I had never met Douglas in person. I could only get a rough idea of him from bits and pieces. But the madness he exuded was somewhat similar to Laura's.

Bob looked at me deeply and said slowly, "The only person Frank truly cared about or was jealous of, from beginning to end, was Alan."

What did that mean?

Could Alan and Laura have had an emotional entanglement?

It was impossible. If they did, Alan would have told me. Besides, in college, Alan and Laura were just good friends. With Alan's personality, it was impossible for him to like Laura.

Bob said, "Nothing happened."

Bob seemed to know what I was thinking. He smiled, shook his head, and said, "I was just thinking, when Alan announced he was with you, we discussed privately why Alan liked you. I couldn't figure it out, and Mike didn't know either. Laura did some digging about you, but after learning about you, she didn't say anything. Instead, Frank was the first to answer."

I asked, "What did Frank say?"

Bob replied, "He said that Alan has withdrawn from the competition."

As he spoke, Bob laughed first. Only when recalling college did he have a smile on his face, looking slightly relaxed.

He smiled, "It's true that Frank and Alan had a good relationship, but Frank always saw Alan as his competitor. He was extremely competitive. Even though they weren't in the same major in college, Frank compared his grades with Alan's. When we joined the drama club, Alan was the playwright, and Frank secretly competed with him, trying to make his roles stand out more."

That did sound like Frank.

If he weren't extremely competitive, he wouldn't have come this far. As the domestic general manager of a foreign company, he was much stronger than the chairman of a company in Silverlight City, like Howard.

"Alan wouldn't like Laura. Frank must be overthinking it," I said.

Bob's expression was a bit strange when he talked about college. He touched his nose, nodded, and said, "That's true, but Laura's attitude towards Alan is indeed puzzling. How should I put it? It's not romantic love. It's more like Laura might poison everyone, even Frank, without hesitation. But she would never harm Alan."

I remembered Laura's words during the trial.

"Ladies and gentlemen, a bond of life and death, a resonance of souls. Why would I kill, and in such a cruel way?"

"Ladies and gentlemen, he is the best playwright, the poet who understands me, the enlightener of my acting path. Alan is the perfect man in my life. Why would I kill?"

"Ladies and gentlemen, I struggle with fate, I am at odds with the world, but I always hold tenderness for Alan."

I couldn't understand it either and murmured, "Why?"

Laura was almost a replica of Douglas. Why was she so gentle and even reverent towards Alan?

Bob said, "I don't know."

Bob shook his head, his eyes darkening slightly.

He sighed and said, "But Frank has always been bothered by this. Don't be fooled by his usual magnanimity. In reality, he's very petty in this regard. No matter how good his relationship with Alan is, according to his words, friendship is friendship, competition is competition. Alan is my best friend, a comrade who would take a bullet for me, but that doesn't stop him from being my rival."

He continued, "And that's always been the case. Before Alan left the old steel mill, Frank competed with him in everything. In that environment, the two of them tried their best to make things better for us. They were like leaders. Frank was sharp, good at reading people, and articulate, so he was closer to the people at the old steel mill. Just like Douglas and Laura in the shadows, some chose to betray and stand on the opposite side. Some were openly outstanding and talented, drifting between us and the old steel mill. Sometimes we didn't even know which side they were on. They always aimed for maximum benefit, like Frank."

"Alan was different. From his appearance, he wasn't particularly outstanding, nor was he as eloquent as Frank. In the eyes of the people at the old steel mill, he was just an ordinary person. But to us kids, his kindness and optimism were so precious. As long as he was there, we weren't afraid of anything. As long as he was there, things would get better."

"Frank and Alan were from completely different worlds, but they had a special bond. However, I know that Frank often had a fire in his heart. He wanted to prove that he was our leader and he could do better than Alan."

###chapter 129 Confrontation

"No matter if it's our small team or the folks at the old steel mill, Frank's actions are driven by our shared struggles and his rivalry with Alan. Maybe he knows deep down that Laura's feelings for Alan aren't romantic, but there's something missing in his heart that money can't fill," Bob said.

So, there was another layer to Alan and Frank's relationship. They were friends and brothers in times of hardship. At the same time, Frank might have seen Alan as a lifelong rival, even though he had far surpassed Alan in societal terms.

Alan was just a low-level clerk at the Silverlight City Forestry Bureau, while Frank had achieved financial freedom over the past decade. Frank couldn't move on, not just to surpass Alan, because of an inner void that wealth and status couldn't fill.

For people like them, life must have been long and torturous. Lally, Bob, and Mike chose to jump ship and start over, while Frank, like a lonely captain, carried his hatred and mission, watching his crew leave one by one, crashing into the reefs of fate.

"I've been thinking about something," I suddenly remembered and asked, "This Entertainment Club is located in the city center, which is also the site of the old steel mill. I've always suspected that the land rights for the old steel mill and the Entertainment Club are owned by the same person. The club hasn't been open for many years, and given the current situation in Silverlight City, it's unrealistic to buy a piece of land in the city center with such convenient transportation, almost as if the roads were built specifically for the club."

Bob looked at me with a hint of surprise in his eyes. "Why do you ask?"

"The owner of the Entertainment Club is Douglas, and Ronald is behind him. But why does Ronald always set up a stall at the club's entrance and never go inside? What is he afraid of? This should be his territory."

"You don't know?" Bob was taken aback.

"What do you mean? What should I know?" I asked.

Bob replied, "You don't know? The owner of the Entertainment Club is Douglas, but the major shareholder behind it is Frank."

What! Frank was the real boss behind the Entertainment Club?

Bob saw my shocked expression and nodded, continuing, "This happened in the past two years. I thought you knew. Douglas was running the club, dealing drugs, and engaging in prostitution, making a lot of money but also causing a lot of trouble. Ronald cleaned up many of those messes. Eventually, Ronald couldn't stand it anymore and had Frank take over."

Bob sneered and said, "Frank would rather see him dead than deal with this mess, but he couldn't go against Ronald's orders. So, he bought the club's shares under the guise of an investment. Officially, it's his, but Douglas still manages the day-to-day operations."

"Duke is using drugs, and I saw many young girls coming out of the club around one in the afternoon. The drug dealing and prostitution haven't stopped; they've become even more rampant," I responded.

"Exactly, you noticed too," Bob nodded and continued, "Frank doesn't care. He even encourages Douglas to be bolder, hoping Douglas will self-destruct."

"I see. My guess was right. The real target that day at the Entertainment Club wasn't Douglas; it was Ronald. Frank's desire to kill Ronald was something the other side had long known. The only way to force Ronald inside was through coercion."

I looked at Bob and said calmly, "Do you remember now?"

Bob frowned, thought seriously, and shook his head. "No, but I can guess. The only way to force Ronald inside is through coercion. Using Douglas to coerce Ronald into coming in. The real purpose of the arson and murder at True Love Entertainment Club was Ronald, but Ronald didn't come in. Frank was too naive in this step."

I looked at Bob's determined yet confused expression. The events he had experienced were split into another person's memory due to his dual personality, like a bystander observing and thinking. This pathological detachment from oneself was a form of sorrow and pain.

If he recalled everything, the combination of memories would be like two puzzle pieces fitting together. One side was the extremely self-assured Bob, and the other was the extremely negative and despondent Bob. As he saw his friends, who had shared hardships, fall apart, he wondered how deep this self-split would go.

"Nancy, what's wrong? Why did you stop halfway?" Bob asked with concern, his voice low. "Have you been too tired these days? Maybe you should rest early. A lot has happened today."

I shook my head, sighed, and looked at Zoey, who hadn't spoken for a while. She was clearly exhausted. Zoey had been the most tired after a day of running around, and the emotional blow she had suffered made it remarkable that she had held on this long. After all, she was still an intern in her senior year, not yet graduated, and wouldn't officially graduate until July 2025.

"Sit down, we've all had a long day," I said.

Zoey yawned quietly and obediently sat next to me. Bob hesitated, then squatted in the corner, away from the light, as if the darkness brought him some comfort.

I frowned. Bob didn't seem quite right.

"Are you okay?" I asked.

"Nothing, just tired. I don't want to sit. Squatting like this is more comfortable. Before college, in Shadow City, I often squatted in the corner, daydreaming. Let's continue. Your analysis makes sense. Ronald is stationed at the Entertainment Club because he's afraid. He's afraid that once he goes in, he won't come out."

Bob focused and analyzed carefully, then looked at me and muttered, "Would Ronald be afraid of Frank?"

I shook my head and instinctively glanced at Bob. "Of course not. Although it sounds inappropriate, Ronald practically raised you. He knows you inside out and is confident he can control you. From my brief interactions with Ronald, he's arrogant, ambitious and highly controlling. But he's missing one thing."

"What?" Bob's eyes lit up.

"A rival," I said seriously.

###chapter 130 Fight for survival

Ronald wasn't just ambitious; he was a thrill-seeker, always craving more control and excitement.

Guys like him never doubt their abilities or smarts. They think they've got everything under control. That was how Ronald, starting from scratch, climbed his way up to head the state police department's criminal investigation team. Next up? Deputy governor. That would be a real game-changer for him.

People with that kind of inner strength were often pretty empty inside. They were lonely and needed a worthy opponent to get their kicks. This opponent should be someone they see as perfect, someone they desire, who could challenge them but wasn't completely under their thumb.

Frank was the perfect choice.

Ronald was like a crafty old hunter, rich and carefree, but he couldn't let his hunting rifle gather dust or lose his passion for the chase. So, he started raising some fierce beasts to challenge himself.

To him, it was all just a game.

He wasn't scared of Frank, so he didn't hesitate to enter the True Love Entertainment Club. He was waiting to see what surprises Frank could throw his way.

In the dull monotony of life, these little thrills and passions were what kept him going.

I was absolutely certain about Ronald's character. In many past cases, the reasons for many suspects' crimes weren't emotional or financial disputes; they were simply seeking thrills.

When I met Ronald for the second time, he still had that unshakable confidence. He put on a great act to trick me into coming to Shadow City to investigate Bob, running errands for him to check on Cedric, who survived the old steel mill, while steering my thoughts in the wrong direction.

But he was wrong.

He saw himself as the father of these kids, thinking he had everything under control. Even when Frank threatened Douglas, he didn't flinch. To him, it didn't hurt much, and he could easily find another.

He didn't see Joseph's betrayal coming. I had reason to suspect that when Joseph mentioned Ronald's name to me, it wasn't to have me investigate Ronald for the truth but to tell me that Ronald had significant issues.

Bob and Mike also turned on him. He had conspired with Laura and Douglas to frame George, thinking George had died at his hands. But Cedric died in George's place, and George survived, being taken care of by Bob and Mike in Shadow City.

These weren't enough to pose a fundamental threat to Ronald, making him personally kill Mike and then come to Shadow City to kill Bob. This was completely out of control for him, a desperate move. What caused such a significant upheaval?

Only one name: Frank.

"What does Ronald think of Laura? And how does he view Douglas pursuing Laura?"

I suddenly thought of something that could tie everything together.

"Ronald and Laura?" Bob blinked, rubbed his temples, and looked up, thinking. "Nothing special, same attitude as the rest of us. He just holds Frank in higher regard."

I continued, "And what about Douglas pursuing Laura?"

Douglas pursuing Laura wasn't a big deal, but I suddenly thought, why was there such a rush to convict Laura? Tony, Tammy, Lally, and Tom only added fuel to the fire because Laura was directly involved in George's case, but they couldn't directly make it happen.

Ronald seemed to be the real force behind wanting Laura dead.

What was the motivation behind it? Douglas was so loyal to Ronald. Could Douglas's death have impacted Ronald deeply?

"Ronald doesn't care about these things." Bob shook his head and continued, "He only cares about order, or the ethics under his father identity. We all have to obey him, and Frank is the best among us, the oldest. We kids should look up to Frank as our elder brother."

"What do you think?"

"We're helpless against Ronald. As for Frank... honestly, we respect him. Whether in personal feelings or abilities, Frank is stronger than us. At the old steel mill, he and Alan helped us a lot. We genuinely recognize him as our elder brother."

"And Laura?"

"She seems indifferent to all this. Frank treats her better..."

"I'm thinking, why was Ronald so eager to convict Laura quickly? It doesn't seem related to Douglas's death. There's only one possibility: it's still because of Frank."

"What do you mean?" Bob frowned, puzzled. He really couldn't remember anything.

"Considering your understanding of Laura, I don't think she would do anything against Ronald, or she has no interest in such matters. Ronald's actions were merely to increase the difficulty of Frank's so-called game, forcing Frank to protect Laura and do more things that would thrill him."

Bob said, "But Frank truly miscalculated."

I looked at Bob's dazed expression and smiled. "He thought you were puppets, controlled at his will. He overlooked the key aspect of human nature. In a way, he really was like a father figure, thinking he controlled his children's fate, not realizing that having such a thought already doomed him to failure."

"Why?" Bob asked, confused.

"Freedom, independence." I said seriously.

Bob was stunned, thinking for a long time, then nodded thoughtfully.

"So, if I'm not mistaken, the reason Ronald, who was always in control and confident, suddenly lost control, personally killing Mike and coming to Shadow City to find you, had nothing to do with you, Mike, or even George. It was because his most fatal flaw was exposed. What is his fatal flaw?"

Bob listened to me, then glanced at Zoey, who was already asleep, resting her head on my shoulder.

Zoey had fallen asleep at some point, breathing evenly and deeply. She had really gone through too many changes in just one day.

"No one would dare harm Zoey. Otherwise, not only Ronald but all of us would go crazy."

"If I'm not mistaken, it should be Howard and Frank."

###chapter 131 George Wakes Up

This couldn't all be a coincidence.

With Howard and Zoey's mom Erica's influence, if they really wanted to stop her, there was no way Zoey would have made it to Shadow City. Yet, here she was.

Howard, with his shrewd way of handling things, why did he deliberately reveal so much about Ronald?

And when Zoey found out about Joseph, Howard's furious phone call to Ronald, slamming the table and cursing-thinking back, it wasn't because it was dangerous. Quite the opposite, Howard was angry because Ronald had thrown his own daughter into the web he had woven.

Ronald's madness deepened, driving him to commit irrational acts of rage, including silencing others through murder.

All of this undoubtedly had Howard's involvement behind the scenes. Whether Erica was involved was still unclear.

But one thing was certain: Howard kept things from me. He only mentioned his good relationship with Frank but didn't say they had teamed up to set Ronald up.

I had a bold theory that ties everything together.

Howard knew about Ronald's activities early on. He might have known Frank for a long time and, with Erica's help, gave Frank significant support. This not only allowed Frank's career to skyrocket within a decade of graduating but also gave him the resources to investigate Ronald thoroughly and deliver a fatal blow.

By the time Ronald realized what was happening, it was too late.

Especially when he saw Zoey in Shadow City, he must have understood everything.

He chose to leave, not because he was confident in controlling everything, but because he had entered a stage of relentless revenge.

That night, Bob and Shirley decided to stay in the hospital with George, finding a bed nearby to sleep.

The hospital was short on beds, so I woke Zoey and found a hotel nearby. Before leaving, I checked with the nurse on duty about George's condition and confirmed that he should wake up by morning if there were no complications.

Zoey was quiet today, falling asleep after saying only a few words. I checked the time-it was around 2 AM. I quickly tidied up and went to sleep.

I slept soundly and woke up around 6 or 7 AM. Zoey was already up and preparing breakfast.

"Mrs. Smith, Mr. Martin must have known about my dad's... situation for a long time, right?" Zoey asked hesitantly while drinking her milk.

"Probably," I nodded, not saying much.

"Is my dad... really that evil? His situation, Mr. Martin and my mom have always known, right? Sorry, Mrs. Smith, I shouldn't ask such stupid questions. I know the answers, but..."

Zoey's eyes were red, and she wiped away tears. She was very smart and knew that if Howard and Erica really wanted to trap her, she wouldn't have made it to Shadow City. 

Erica realized that the only way to stop Ronald's killing spree was for his daughter Zoey to appear before him.

"Zoey, everyone makes their own choices, and they must face the consequences, whether good or bad. This applies to adults and even children. No one can change that. No matter how evil your father is, that's society's judgment. As a father, he protected you, and I think that makes him a good father. He loves you." I patted Zoey's head gently.

"I understand," Zoey sighed, not saying anything more. Since I've known her, I've rarely seen her sigh. In that moment, she seemed to grow up a lot.

Growing up was always painful, but fate had been especially cruel to Zoey.

After breakfast, we hurried to the hospital. On the way, Bob called to say George had woken up.

Zoey and I were thrilled. We stopped at a fruit market to buy some fruit and then took a cab to the hospital.

At the hospital room, Bob had just finished feeding George some oatmeal. George looked in good spirits. When he saw me, his eyes lit up, and he waved enthusiastically.

"Nancy? Come here, let me take a good look at Alan's wife!"

"Mr. Thompson, hello," I greeted with a smile. It seemed he wasn't seriously hurt, waking up after just one night. I led Zoey into the room.

Zoey looked a bit uneasy. She bowed deeply to George and sincerely said, "I'm sorry."

George was taken aback, looked at Zoey carefully, then laughed and waved his hand, pulling Zoey to sit by the bed.

"You're Ronald's daughter, right? You do look a bit like him, but you're much prettier. You take after your mother, Erica, if I remember correctly."

"You know my mom?" Zoey asked, surprised.

"Not really. I've seen her photo. Ronald showed it to me."

George's eyes flickered as he looked at Zoey and sighed.

"Don't blame yourself. This has nothing to do with you. You don't need to apologize for your father. Even he doesn't need to apologize to me. This was his choice. His inferiority and arrogance led him to self-destruction. Howard and I tried to stop him many times, but it was no use. This was his fate."

Howard? I didn't expect Howard to be so deeply involved in this old case from over twenty years ago.

"Can you tell us about what happened back then?" I asked.

"Dad, the doctor said you shouldn't talk too much. Let's rest for a bit..." Bob interrupted, covering George with a blanket and giving me a meaningful look.

I realized he was right. George had just woken up and shouldn't be thinking too much, especially about the past. If his emotions got stirred up and his health worsened, it wouldn't be worth it.

George, in a way, was like a father to Alan, watching him grow up. Their personalities were very similar. As Alan's wife, I naturally wanted to treat George well.

George glared at Bob and smacked him on the head.

"I'm talking to Alan's wife. What's it to you? Why do you look so down? Are you sick again? Where's the Shadow City contemporary artist, the soul dancer, the theater troupe's only dancer? Can you bring him back? And Nancy is your sister-in-law, you know that, right?"

Bob laughed awkwardly. How could such a heavy topic like split personalities sound so light coming from George? He stammered, "Dad, whether I can bring him back isn't up to me. And I know Nancy is my sister-in-law."

I smiled. George's awakening had improved Bob's mood significantly. He was talking more and sounded more like his old self from college.

###chapter 132 Inferiority and Transcendence (1)

"You won't believe it, but Ronald's actually super insecure and shy."

George took the water Bob handed him, sipped it, and winced a bit. His wound must still hurt. I was about to say something, but George smiled and shook his head, letting me know he was okay.

"He's got the smarts, the strategy, and the resources of a natural-born schemer."

I quickly shared my thoughts on Ronald.

George's wrinkled face, framed by silver hair, had eyes that sparkled as he looked at me. He nodded and smiled approvingly.

"You're right on the money. Alan's got a good eye, and that makes me happy. But any extreme personality is shaped by their environment and experiences. Behavioral psychology suggests that environment is key in shaping one's personality."

I was surprised. Behavioral psychology, a theory proposed by psychologists like John Watson in the last century, was familiar to those in law or criminal investigation. But George, from what I knew, was just a steel mill worker. How could he know this?

Seeing my expression, George chuckled. "Bob mentioned you've been investigating this case. You've tracked it from Sand Village all the way here. That's no small feat. You've met Ronald, so you probably know a bit about me from him. Yeah, I've read some psychology books and even thought about becoming a cop or helping the police. Ronald always thought I was naive and ridiculous."

I remembered Ronald mentioning that when George was young, the foreman of the old steel mill's production team asked if he could become a cop. There was a hint of mockery in his words, or maybe he found it naive and laughable. I didn't say anything. That burning sense of justice and pursuit of ideals, embodied in the police profession, is noble, not something to be ridiculed.

"Let me think."

George looked up, blinking, with a smile on his face, as if genuinely reminiscing about an old friend. He didn't seem to mind that he was in the hospital because of Ronald, who had come to kill him.

"I actually met Ronald in '97, but he probably got to know me around '99. We drank together many times. Oh, and Howard, your boss, the founder of the Silverlight City Legal Journal."

At this, George smiled and gave me a deep look.

I smiled slightly.

George seemed surprised. "You figured it out?"

"Yeah, from the moment Zoey came to Shadow City, I had a hunch. Howard and Erica had their reasons. They had many ways to keep Zoey in check. Her coming here meant Howard and Erica knew about Ronald. I figured they had no choice but to send Zoey to stop him. Plus, the detailed records of the Sand Village demolition brawl in our Silverlight City Journal archives and the relationship between Howard and Frank suggested some connection between you three. But I didn't expect it to go back so far."

"Very good, very impressive. Alan's judgment is spot on. My Alan found a good wife." George looked at me with admiration, nodding in approval.

"I met Ronald when I went to the Sand Village police station to handle employee residency paperwork. I happened to see him at a phone booth, crying while talking to his family. He said the company people bullied him for being from the countryside. His girlfriend wanted to get married, but he had no money. When he visited her family last week, they didn't treat him well."

George laughed, habitually reaching into his pocket for a cigarette, then remembered he was in a hospital and a patient. He pursed his lips and continued.

"Young people should get married around that time. The pressure of work and marriage isn't just on today's youth; it was the same for us. In the old phone booth, everyone could hear the conversation. I happened to overhear Ronald's father mentioned they were poor and couldn't match up to the wealthier city folks. He told Ronald to come back to the village and be a teacher after graduation, emphasizing that their family couldn't afford to buy him a house in the city. He questioned why Ronald insisted on making a name for himself in the city, wondering if that was truly where he belonged. Something like that."

I was silent. Ronald had such an experience.

"I've seen this many times. Most young people who couldn't make it in the city went back to the village to get married. But Ronald he would make a mark in the city and prove himself to Erica's parents. After hanging up, he wiped his tears and angrily returned to the police station."

That determination marked a turning point for Ronald. It was the impulsive words of someone born into humble beginnings, but it sealed his fate. His distorted views would inevitably lead him into the abyss.

"Those two years, I often saw Ronald patrolling around Sand Village. He embraced his role as a cop. He was passionate and dedicated. I really thought he was a good young man, full of enthusiasm, with a loud voice, standing tall and straight in his spotless uniform. That was probably the best time of his life. Then came the old steel mill incident. There's something you might not know. I don't think Ronald would have told you, and Howard never mentioned it either."

George interrupted his reminiscence suddenly.

"What is it?" I asked.

George frowned, a look of sorrow flowing through his wrinkled face. He sighed deeply, glanced at Bob and me, then at Zoey, seeming hesitant.

"Mr. Thompson, please go ahead. Whatever my father did, there should be a conclusion. As his daughter, I won't be biased. You don't need to consider my feelings. I... I really want to know what happened back then." Zoey said resolutely, though a hint of sadness flashed in her eyes.

"Alright." George nodded, hesitated for a moment, then slowly said, "Actually... the old steel mill case was already solved back then."

###chapter 133 Inferiority and Transcendence (2)

"What!"

Zoey and I shouted together, our eyes wide with disbelief as we stared at George. We couldn't believe the news he had just dropped on us.

All this time, we thought this was a cold case, with everyone involved taken out by Ronald years ago. But now, it turns out the case has been solved?

I couldn't wrap my head around it. When I thought back on the timeline and key players, everything seemed so blurry, like trying to see through fog. Over the past twenty years, so many pieces of information got tangled up. I had been so focused on individual fates that I missed the bigger picture.

Looking back, George wasn't just a friendly, upright former foreman from the old steel mill. Howard wasn't just a concerned friend of Ronald. The deep connections between George, Howard, Ronald, and the old steel mill were way more complicated than I had imagined.

George seemed unfazed by our reaction. He sighed and confirmed, "Yep, the case has been solved. Our investigation revealed that the people involved in the old steel mill's criminal activities were closely connected to the then-chief of police, now the state police commissioner, Riley Harvey"

That made sense. The old steel mill's rampant child trafficking and organ trade went unnoticed not just because they were well-hidden, but because the local police chief was protecting them. Even if someone discovered their activities, it would never get out.

"But this never made the news. When I looked through the records, the history of the old steel mill just stopped at its relocation," I said.

"History only shows what it wants you to see. Maybe that time, we played the role of history's creators, whether by chance or by necessity," George replied.

"After we figured it out, we were all excited. I borrowed an old camera from the mill and secretly took a lot of photos. Howard, just starting his law practice, used all his savings to prepare a lawsuit. He wanted justice for the children and to help his friend Ronald. If this came to light, Ronald would get the credit, which would be crucial for his career," George said, his eyes sparkling as if reliving those intense, passionate days. It was a time of pure, fervent action for justice and friendship.

George smiled, but his eyes glistened with tears. Knowing the mastermind behind the case and seeing it quietly suppressed, I realized how Ronald had reached his current position.

Some said life was full of infinite possibilities, but more often than not, it felt like a set of predetermined tracks-something closer to fate. Changing your destiny might require the ultimate sacrifice, including your conscience.

"Then Ronald betrayed you," I said solemnly.

George hesitated, his eyes avoiding mine. Finally, he sighed and said, "Betrayal is a heavy word. He didn't betray us; he betrayed his own conscience. In my memory, it was a grand, miraculous time. A laid-off factory worker, a frustrated cop, and a budding lawyer-three unrelated people brought together by fate, united for the children of the old steel mill, for justice, for a hopeful world..."

"We planned to report it together, but he didn't show up. Instead, our evidence was dismissed for being insufficient. When I checked the bag, everything had been switched. At that moment, I knew Ronald's choice. I was reprimanded at the factory, and Howard lost his job and couldn't work as a lawyer anymore," George said wistfully.

"What did Ronald say?" I asked.

"He said he would make it up to us," Howard replied calmly. "At a dinner, he confessed everything to Riley, the police chief, taking all the blame himself."

"It looked like an apology, but he was using you as leverage to get close to Riley," I said, holding Zoey's hand as her expression darkened.

"Not exactly," George shook his head. "He did tamper with the evidence, but he didn't mention us to Riley. Maybe it was his way of compensating himself. We drank together many times, and he always said he wanted to be a good cop, to climb to the top, to make Erica's parents proud, to make everyone respect him."

"I believed him. Soon after, he went from a regular cop to the head of the detective squad, solving major cases in the city. He proved himself when given the chance. He helped Howard find cases, and Howard's career improved. That was his way of making amends," George said, smiling bitterly.

"I still believed him then, thinking he was navigating the situation for everyone's benefit. If Riley found out, we would have been in serious trouble. Ronald swore he was doing it for us and the children, but we couldn't touch the powerful interests behind it," George continued, pausing to look at his hands, the lines like the tangled threads of fate.

"But after he said those words, I stopped believing him. I knew his ambition wouldn't stop there. Pandora's box was open, and it wouldn't close. I wanted to save the children and him... You know the rest," George said, glancing at Zoey.

"After the fire at the old steel mill, I survived. Howard was doing well in Silverlight City's legal circles, partly thanks to Ronald. But the day after the fire, Howard quit his job and never practiced law again. Not long after, Erica, pregnant, married Ronald," George said.

"Mr. Thompson, do you hate him?" Zoey asked, her voice filled with complex emotions.

###chapter 134 Acquittal (1)

"Hate?"

George looked at Zoey, genuinely surprised, like the question had never crossed his mind before.

They had once been the best of friends, united by a common goal. But twenty years ago, that friend had tried to kill him, and even now, two decades later, was still trying.

For over twenty years, George had been in hiding, never seeing his son or wife, as if he had vanished from the world. He endured endless loneliness and pain all by himself.

How did one hate someone? Did they curse them, wish for their death to ease the hatred in their heart? Or did they wish for them to suffer more than death, to live in agony, sleepless nights, constant worry, tormented by life or fate until they lost their sanity?

What I got was George's laughter.

His smile had a mysterious power, much like Alan's gentle smile, unpretentious and understated, with the corners of his mouth slightly upturned, like a spring breeze brushing across his face. The laughter seemed to come from the depths of his soul, audible from any distance, even from the depths of hell.

"Over twenty years ago, someone died in my place. I was knocked out by the smoke, and when I woke up, the old steel mill was in ruins, everything charred black. In that moment, I felt like the fire had burned away all my ideals, friendships, justice, and family. I couldn't cry, and there was no hatred in my mind. I knew who did it, but I just couldn't hate them."

George looked at me, Zoey, and Bob with a smile, his eyes glistening with tears. He paused for a moment.

"I stood there, my mind blank, dazed for a long time. Was I betrayed, or had I faced some calamity? I should have cried out loud to release my emotions and quickly calm down, as the psychology books suggest, but I didn't. In that instant, I seemed to return to my teenage years, when I would do anything for a friend, only to be reported for fighting and punished by the school. I thought about it, and it wasn't much different. Of course, I was sad, but not for my own suffering. I was sad for that childhood friend and for Ronald. People are too obsessed. I tried my best but couldn't save them. That's my fault..."

"What about your middle school friend? How is he now?" Zoey asked instinctively, her eyes shining with a different light, perhaps a mix of pleading and unrealistic hope.

It was human nature. I knew that everyone who knew about this would tell Zoey that it was her father's issue and had nothing to do with her, that she shouldn't feel any psychological burden. It was an unrealistic attempt to distance oneself from the pain, like waking up from a nightmare and mumbling, "It has nothing to do with you, don't worry about it."

But how could that be possible?

Watching her father step into sin and face the cycle of karma, how painful must that be for a child?

I understood Zoey, so I echoed her question.

That was all I could do. I wanted to deeply understand Zoey's feelings and hoped to do a little more for her.

George didn't speak. His Adam's apple bobbed up and down a couple of times, like he was trying to swallow the pain in his heart. For over twenty years, he'd always managed to do that, but this time he couldn't. He broke down, his voice trembling as he pointed to himself and then to the sky.

Zoey let out an instinctive scream. I was stunned. We looked at each other, sharing a sense of disbelief.

We understood. His childhood friend had grown up and worked with George at the steel mill. When the mill relocated, he stayed behind at the old mill, forced to cook for criminals. Later, he learned of Ronald's plan, couldn't persuade him, and died in the fire in George's place.

The martyr's beginning and end, everything became clear.

I was speechless.

Zoey's expression darkened, her pain deepening.

"No need for that. Everyone has their fate. Maybe I lived these extra twenty years to save him and bring closure to this matter."

George said slowly, frowning and touching his chest. Maybe talking too much and the emotional turmoil had caused his wound to reopen.

"Dad..."

Bob hesitated. He knew George's temperament well. If he could be persuaded, there wouldn't have been the grudges from over twenty years ago.

"Guess who I saw in the ruins the next morning?"

George looked at me with interest. The answer was obvious: Howard.

I suddenly understood why George could live in hiding for so many years. Bob and Mike were just kids when they left the old steel mill and lived with other children in Shadow City under Ronald's supervision. They couldn't have seen George.

But if Howard had helped, Ronald would never have suspected that his best friend had hidden George in Shadow City, right under his nose, for years without being discovered. Only Howard could have come up with such a plan. This also explained why Bob insisted on returning to Shadow City after graduation.

"What did Howard say?" I asked.

George wasn't surprised that I guessed it. He glanced at Zoey, perhaps seeing some inexplicable resemblance to Howard, and replied, "Like her, he asked if I hated. I said I didn't."

"And then? What did Mr. Martin say?" Zoey asked.

"He cried, took out his lawyer's license from his briefcase, and threw it into the still-warm fire, burning it to ashes. He mentioned that I was truly compassionate. He couldn't be like me, but he couldn't bear to let Ronald continue making mistakes. It will end someday."

George said, repeating the last sentence, "It will end someday."

Yes, it would end. That day was not far off.

"Do you miss home? Your family has your picture hanging up. Tom and Tony have been thinking about you." I asked, recalling the years Tammy had spent raising two kids in Sand Village, thinking of Tony's feelings for Anna and Lally. I didn't know what to say.

George nodded. "I miss them. I know it's been hard for them, but I can't show up. Ronald has always had doubts about my death, even if he doesn't say it. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had Laura arrange for Anna to be in Tony's life."

###chapter 135 Acquittal (2)

"What? Ronald was the mastermind behind what happened to Anna?"

I was floored. I always thought it was Laura's twisted idea, but it turned out Ronald was the one pulling the strings.

And it was clear Ronald had his suspicions about George's death. He kept trying to force George out of hiding.

This guy... his mind was really something else.

But waited, that didn't add up. From what we knew, Laura was completely loyal to Ronald. So why was Ronald so eager to get rid of Laura?

Could it be that Laura actually betrayed Ronald?

That didn't fit her crazy personality.

"Laura's loyalty to Ronald is real, and Ronald wanting to kill Laura is also real."

George's expression turned serious when he mentioned Laura. Even he seemed to find it hard to believe.

After hesitating for a while, he slowly said, "There's something you might not know, something even Bob and Mike don't know."

"What is it?"

"Douglas is Laura's younger brother." George said seriously.

"What!" We exclaimed in unison, "Douglas is Laura's younger brother!"

Bob looked at George in disbelief. All these years, George had never mentioned it!

"She's insane... this woman is insane."

His face turned pale, eyes wide open, shaking his head continuously, unable to suppress a shiver. Just how crazy was Laura?

No, Laura wasn't crazy. From the old steel mill to now, she had been methodically carrying out one thing: revenge.

Bob had told me Laura's story. She came from a remote, poor area where boys were valued over girls. Her parents wanted a boy, and after having Laura, they raised her for a few years, then sold her when they had a son.

Suddenly, I remembered Douglas. "So, did Laura's parents sell both kids?"

It was hard to believe there were parents so heartless they'd sell their own children for money.

"No." George frowned, looking at me with a serious expression. "Douglas wasn't sold. He... wasn't like that in my memory."

He opened his mouth, a complex and confused look in his eyes. The pretty little girl he once saw now filled him with instinctive fear.

A chill ran down my spine, my fingers turned cold, and my eyes widened as my voice began to tremble. "Did Laura kidnap him?"

George was stunned, not expecting me to guess it. He sighed and nodded. "Yes."

Laura was just a few years old then! She managed to kidnap Douglas to the old steel mill!

At such a young age, she had the cunning and courage, driven by deep hatred for her parents. She never told Douglas about their relationship, instead making him fall for her while she played hard to get, keeping him hooked from the start.

She waited until Douglas was deeply in love with her, then killed him herself!

This went beyond being scheming or cruel. She was like a demon.

"She's insane... she's truly a madwoman." Bob kept muttering, his face pale.

"Bob?"

George looked at his adopted son with concern. Bob seemed off.

"I'm fine... I just feel like... I never really knew Laura. This person... is terrifying."

Bob licked his dry lips, swallowed hard, and looked at us with a complex expression, opening his mouth to speak, "Do you know why Douglas was so obsessed with Laura, why he couldn't forget her?"

He gave a bitter smile and continued, "When we were in college, we agreed not to talk about the past and to focus on the future. But Douglas would often come to school to court Laura. She had many admirers, so no one thought much of it. But I was curious and asked. Laura gave a charming smile, and I remembered it as one of her many flings."

Everyone's expressions darkened, eyes wide open.

"Ridiculous, ridiculous." George coughed a few times, agitated.

"Are you sure?"

Zoey and I exchanged a glance, still unsure. Laura's erratic behavior made it hard to believe everything she said.

"Yes, it's true. Frank argued with Laura about it. That doesn't mean much, but... Douglas was always single. His feelings for Laura were unwavering. The night before college, Laura and Douglas didn't come back. I think... after that, Douglas's pursuit of Laura intensified. Even if she ignored him, he was willing to do anything for her, even if she was with other men." Bob said calmly.

He was talking about Douglas, but I was thinking about Frank.

These two men, one lost his life, the other was on the brink of death, all for Laura. They were so similar, willing to sacrifice everything for the woman they loved. Even if Frank hated Laura, deep down, he still loved her.

"By the way."

Bob's face showed a hint of confusion and pain, as if he had experienced it all but couldn't remember, slowly saying, "Douglas didn't have much education, but in high school, he wrote a poem for Laura."

"If I say I love you, I will love your past, your tantrums, your flaws."

"If I say I love you, I will offer my heart, lungs, and soul to the god of love in hell."

"If I say I love you, I will drain my blood, leaving only my skin to wrap your soul, escaping death's grasp."

"If I say I love you, we will kiss passionately, tongues entwined, bodies merged, burning away sin and pain."

"We will meet again."

I was stunned, memories flooding my mind like a sudden storm.

Alan had written this poem in his notebook while writing his novel.

It turned out Douglas wrote it for Laura. Everything came full circle, from the moment I saw the notebook, I was destined to be involved in this.

The fire at True Love Entertainment Club, the organs hanging from the ceiling, the blood dried by the fire, leaving only a charred body in the police station.

When Douglas wrote that poem for Laura, his fate was sealed.

Why...

The phone rang. It was Leonard.

"Laura was just declared not guilty and released."

###chapter 136 Return to Silverlight City

"And also..."

Leonard's voice was rough, like he was struggling to keep it together.

"Frank's officially reported Ronald, handed over all the evidence. Laura was framed. The cops, the prosecutor's office, the court-they're all after Ronald, but they can't find him. You need to come back as soon as possible. Shadow City isn't safe. Benjamin's awake, so don't worry about him."

Leonard had other things to deal with and hung up quickly.

"We need to head back to Silverlight City."

I stood up and relayed Leonard's message.

"Mr. Thompson, come back with us to Silverlight City. It's all coming to an end," I said gently.

After hiding in Shadow City for over twenty years under a new identity, going back to Silverlight City was risky. If his cover was blown, it could spell disaster for the whole family. Ronald, always paranoid, had even used Laura to send Anna to test Tony's family, constantly pressuring Tony to see if he was still alive.

Now, the showdown between Frank and Ronald had hit a boiling point.

Frank had officially reported Ronald, gathering all the evidence from these years. With such solid proof, Ronald had almost no chance of turning things around. Currently, Ronald was missing, and in his desperation, he might retaliate. Staying in Shadow City was the least safe option.

Right now, Silverlight City was the safest place.

George's eyes filled with tears. He slowly closed his eyes and nodded firmly.

"Yes, even if I die, I want to die in Silverlight City."

"I think Nancy and Zoey should go back first. Shirley and I can stay with you for a few days until you're well enough to travel," Bob suggested.

Bob's suggestion made sense. After all, as children, we should consider our parents' well-being.

Unexpectedly, George glared at Bob and snorted, "That was just a figure of speech. I have to go back. And when did you become so narrow-minded? This whole thing started with me, so I have to be there to witness Ronald's end. Am I supposed to lie in the hospital and have them livestream it for me? Should I send them a gift or something?"

Zoey chuckled at George's exaggerated expression.

I hadn't expected George to have a humorous side in his daily life, especially when dealing with Bob. Perhaps Bob's optimistic and hopeful nature, which had persisted through college, was partly influenced by George.

Thinking of this, I remembered Benjamin and Ruben. Last night, I had messaged Ruben to check on Benjamin. Ruben sent a short video, patting his chest and saying, "Mrs. Smith, don't worry! With me around, my teacher will be fine!"

Maybe it was not that careless people didn't notice the love and details in life, but rather that they were braver in embracing imperfections and protecting the hard-won happiness and beauty.

Benjamin and Ruben were like that, and so were George and Bob.

Zoey contacted the hospital in Silverlight City and quickly arranged for the transfer. The hospital's special vehicle would take us directly to Harmony Hospital in Silverlight City.

While Zoey went downstairs to handle the transfer paperwork, I quickly called Howard. He had been involved in this matter over twenty years ago, and with Ronald's current state, I was worried about Howard's safety.

What worried me even more was that Howard hadn't responded to my messages since last night.

Sure enough, after several calls, no one answered. Had something happened to Howard? Last night, I overheard Zoey calling Erica to ensure her safety, so Zoey's mom seemed safe for now. But Howard was still missing. I called some colleagues, but they hadn't seen Howard at the office recently either.

The only people I knew who were close to Howard were Frank and Tom. Could I still trust them?

As I pondered, a sense of foreboding settled in my heart.

Seeing Zoey walk in, I quickly asked, "Zoey, did you finish the transfer paperwork?"

"Yeah, I just talked to my mom. She knows the directors of both Harmony Hospital and the hospital here, so the transfer was processed quickly. There's a hospital vehicle available at 1 PM to take us directly to Harmony Hospital in Silverlight City."

"But," Zoey hesitated, "Mr. Thompson just woke up, and the medical staff and attending physician need to accompany him. We might not have room in the hospital vehicle."

"No problem, we can rent a car. There's still time."

I felt relieved. It seemed Erica was safe for now. I decided not to ask Erica about Howard's whereabouts. If she knew he was missing, she would take action. If she didn't know, telling her might jeopardize her safety.

I checked the time on my phone. It was 10:30 AM. I opened the car rental app and booked a car to be delivered to the hospital by 12:30 PM. I also ordered some food for everyone, including some light meals for George.

Bob called Shirley to tell her about returning to Silverlight City. He asked her to stay in Shadow City for a few days, but I overheard Shirley's anxious voice insisting on coming along. They almost argued, but George coughed, and Bob looked at him, smiled, and said into the phone, "We'll get married when I get back."

The other end of the line went silent. George nodded approvingly and said with a smile, "Now that's a man."

The tense atmosphere eased a bit thanks to Bob's call. I took the opportunity to tease.

"Our playboy, the self-proclaimed lifelong bachelor artist, is finally settling down and walking into the grave of love?"

Zoey giggled, watching the scene with interest.

Bob looked embarrassed, scratching his head and struggling to find words. After a while, he said, "I don't know what the other me is like, but if this matter is resolved, I think my illness will get better. I owe Shirley an explanation. She's always wanted to get married, so let's do it. It's not her luck; it's mine."

At 1 PM, Bob and the medical staff loaded George into the hospital vehicle and left the hospital.

I drove the rented car, with Zoey in the passenger seat, following closely behind.

Shadow City, though old and rundown, had the advantage of less traffic, so we didn't encounter any jams. We smoothly got onto the highway and sped towards Silverlight City. Leaving at 1 PM, we should reach Harmony Hospital by 8 or 9 PM.

Zoey asked why I didn't hire a driver. I joked that I could drive faster myself. In truth, I had a nagging feeling that things wouldn't go smoothly in Silverlight City. I wanted to keep our return as discreet as possible, even from strangers.

Around 3 PM, feeling drowsy from lack of sleep the night before, I yawned.

"Mrs. Smith, how about I drive for a while so you can rest?" Zoey suggested.

"No, it's fine. We'll switch around 5 PM. If you're hungry, there are snacks in the back seat."

"Mrs. Smith," Zoey hesitated, looking at me, "you're driving slower and slower. We're below the minimum speed limit for the highway."

I was startled and realized we had lost sight of the hospital vehicle ahead.

I checked the fuel gauge. The tank was below 10%. Damn! This car had issues!

Just then, I looked up and saw a car speeding towards us from the left!

###chapter 137 The Last Cigarette (1)

Silverlight City, winter.

The sky was a dull gray, and the biting wind made it feel like the winter of 2024 would never end.

The smog had reduced visibility to almost nothing, barely twenty feet. The few cars on the street had their headlights on, cutting through the fog like searchlights in a post-apocalyptic scene.

The memories were so vivid.

Over twenty years ago, after the fire at the old steel mill, Joseph, who was still trying to change his body's estrogen levels, had survived by hiding in a storage room, dressed in girls' clothes.

It was Frank who had placed him there when the fire broke out.

"Don't come out. This is the farthest corner of the old steel mill. The storage room has a vent, so you'll get fresh air and won't suffocate. If the fire ends and everyone else is dead, I'll come find you, and we'll leave this place together. Listen, Joseph, you can't die."

He stayed put, unmoving, as the flames roared and the cries for help filled his ears.

He didn't know how much time had passed when he saw, through the cracks, glowing objects moving around in the smoke-filled, low-visibility environment, like the eyes of monsters. He was terrified and covered his mouth to stay silent.

Suddenly, the door opened.

Several flashlight beams pierced the darkness. He instinctively closed his eyes, his delicate face and long eyelashes making him look like a fragile porcelain doll awaiting its fate.

After a long while, he opened his beautiful eyes and looked up at the police officers.

They stared at the long-haired child in girls' clothes, puzzled by the small lump forming in his throat.

"Are you a boy or a girl?"

He didn't answer, his eyes wide as he looked at the charred remains of the room. The blockage in his chest suddenly burst free.

He cried out, "I'm a boy!"

The locked hotel door was finally unlocked.

In the smoggy weather, visibility was extremely low.

Through the gray haze, the scattered car lights flickered faintly.

Joseph frowned, the fragments of his memory making him uncomfortable.

He had never escaped the old steel mill. After the fire, the police took him away, and thanks to Ronald's maneuvering, he soon found himself in Shadow City.

The door from his childhood memories, which he thought led to freedom, turned out to be just a transfer to another prison.

Fate had sentenced him to life imprisonment in its own name.

Joseph stepped out of the hotel door.

His steps were steady and firm, with no hint of post-trauma relief or relaxation.

He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. There were only a few left. Every time he smoked, Evelyn would softly nag him. He hesitated but lit one anyway.

Joseph exhaled a puff of smoke, the mist swirling around him.

Someone was waiting for him ahead. When he saw the person, Joseph smiled and walked over leisurely.

The man in the black trench coat looked sharp, with his hair slicked back and gold-rimmed glasses, exuding an air of high society. The Maybach beside him underscored his status.

"Not mad at me?" Tom smiled as he saw Joseph, speaking lightly.

"Fuck you!" Joseph laughed and cursed, the two men sharing a knowing high-five and a light punch to each other's chests.

Tom said, "Hop in. I'll take you to see Frank."

"No." Joseph replied.

Tom gave him a puzzled look.

Joseph didn't say anything, taking a deep drag on his cigarette and blowing smoke rings at the Maybach, squinting at the car that so many young people dreamed of.

He suddenly chuckled and said, "What? I've been meaning to ask you, is this car really yours? You used to drive it around, showing off, and I always wanted to ask but never did."

"What do you think?" Tom smiled, looking at his old friend. "Once everything's over, you can drive this car. Take Evelyn for a spin."

"No." Joseph scoffed, rolling his eyes at Tom, looking like someone who didn't understand the value of money, and said, "I can't even afford the gas!"

Tom chuckled, shaking his head. The boy who once pretended to be a girl had now become a confident man, albeit a bit rough around the edges.

"Ronald's been arrested." Tom's voice carried a barely contained excitement.

Joseph paused, nodding without speaking, but his demeanor changed. He leaned against the car, staring at the nearly finished cigarette, lost in thought.

"All these years, Frank and I have been gathering evidence of Ronald's crimes, waiting for this day. Frank filed a formal complaint, and the evidence was solid. The state has issued a warrant, and Laura has been exonerated."

Tom's pride was evident as he reached out for a cigarette.

"You smoke?" Joseph asked.

"Are you kidding me? Who gave me my first cigarette?" Tom laughed, clearly in a good mood.

Joseph pulled out his pack, offering three cigarettes to Tom.

This was their college habit-sharing half their cigarettes when one was out.

Tom took one, lighting it up. The cheap cigarette was harsh on his throat, but he enjoyed it. He rarely smoked, only on special occasions, like a victor celebrating with champagne and cigars.

"These three cigarettes, one for you, one for Frank, and one for Alan. Make sure they get them."

The last cigarette in the pack was for himself, a common practice among smokers.

Joseph lit his final cigarette.

"What do you mean?" Tom asked, sensing something off about Joseph today.

"Nothing. I know where Alan is. I'm not an idiot. Those two have been at it their whole lives. Just give it to them. They'll understand."

Joseph leaned against the Maybach, squinting, and after a long pause, he said, "Do you think Frank did all this for us, for himself, or for Laura?"

###chapter 138 The Last Cigarette (2)

"What do you mean?"

"Nothing much. Frank's not here, so what's the big deal? Why can't we talk about it?"

Tom stared at the ground, silent for a long time. After much thought, he looked up and said, "A bit of both."

People were complicated, especially those like them, entangled by hatred, fate, and mission. They never seemed to have the chance to ponder such philosophical questions.

Even though Frank was like a mentor to Tom, and even though Tom sometimes wondered if Frank was being too extreme, the day they set sail, their fates were tightly bound together. This ship could only move forward, with no room for hesitation.

Otherwise, it would mean certain death.

"You're quite fair. How are Lally and Tony doing? And what about Anna, your sister-in-law?"

Joseph sighed, not pressing further, and asked about the others. When he mentioned Anna, a hint of amusement crossed his face.

Back then, Frank, Joseph, and Tom all saw it clearly. It was a setup orchestrated by Ronald, with Laura directing her gold-digging pawn to test the waters at the Thompson House, to see if George was really dead. First, they tested Tom, but Tom was too smart to fall for it. His brother Tony, however, was a different story. Tony, the hopeless romantic, was determined to be with Anna.

"They're all doing well, including... including Anna," Tom said flatly. Suddenly, he remembered something, his eyes darkened, and he spoke softly, "I heard a couple of days ago that Duke had a drug relapse in prison, his heart stopped, and they couldn't save him."

Duke, dead?

"Did you have anything to do with it?" Joseph turned sharply.

Tony had deep feelings for Lally, but he kept them hidden. Even after getting married, those feelings remained buried. Tom despised Duke, believing Lally and Tony were meant to be together. Ever since Douglas got Duke hooked on drugs, Tom had ignored Duke. Now, Duke had just been imprisoned for multiple charges, including rape and assault, and suddenly he was dead.

Tom's expression grew serious as he met Joseph's gaze and slowly shook his head.

It seemed true...

"We agreed from the start, revenge is one thing, but we don't involve our own. Tony and Lally just wanted to tell Nancy the truth about what happened. What's wrong with that? Does Frank's grand plan to defy fate and the gods mean everyone has to die with him?"

"He's just a businessman, a CEO of a Fortune 500 company. How dare he go up against someone who is about to become the state police chief? Doesn't he realize that by doing this, he's no different from Ronald? Does he remember our vow for freedom?"

Joseph's voice grew louder, but as his face twisted with anger, his voice grew softer, as if something was stuck in his throat.

"And you? The night Douglas died, you were sent to the police morgue by Ronald. Why did you hint to Nancy on your way back? Why involve her in this? Didn't you betray our promise?" Tom lunged at Joseph, grabbing his collar, his voice filled with rage.

But he noticed Joseph's body slowly collapsing.

Tom realized something was wrong and quickly moved his hands from Joseph's collar to his waist, trying to support him.

"Joseph! What's wrong?"

Tom frantically searched for wounds, especially around the neck, arteries, and heart, but found nothing.

Blood was already trickling from Joseph's mouth.

"Damn it, I treat you all the same. These cigarettes... all at once..."

Tom remembered when they were kids at the old steel mill, whenever he, Frank, and Alan argued, it was always Joseph, a few years younger, who played peacemaker. He would carefully break a cookie into four pieces and hand them out, smiling and saying, "We're best friends for life. Best friends don't fight."

A tear fell from Tom's eye, while blood trickled from his prosthetic eye.

"I was investigated because Frank reported me... to take down Ronald. I... I don't blame him, but he... he didn't know. Before I went in, I had Evelyn tell Nancy that Alan is still alive. She must understand by now."

Joseph's face was pale, a triumphant smile on his blood-stained lips.

"I saw Ronald before I got out. If I didn't take the poison, I wouldn't have made it out to see you... He's still in Silverlight City."

Tom picked up Joseph and placed him in the car.

"We're going to the hospital. Don't talk, stay awake, stay alive! Listen, Joseph! You can't die!"

Those familiar words, Joseph closed his eyes, remembering someone saying the same thing to him over twenty years ago.

The Maybach roared to life, speeding towards the hospital.

Snow began to fall, and Joseph, leaning against the window, watched the snowy landscape, recalling his first day at the old steel mill. It had snowed that day too, and a child inside had pressed his face against the glass, watching him.

The first to greet him was Tom.

Joseph murmured weakly, "Tom."

"Don't talk! Save your strength!"

Joseph added, "I mean... meeting you guys at the old steel mill wasn't so bad."

Tom, with tears in his voice, ignored the traffic lights, flooring the gas pedal.

"Don't go to the hospital. Take me home. While I still have breath, I want to see Evelyn one last time. I called her when I got out. She's waiting at the gate."

Joseph's vision blurred, but he felt the car make a sharp turn, and through the haze, he saw the road sign pointing home.

He smiled weakly and whispered, "Frank has changed. Don't trust him so much. I suspect Tony's disability is connected to Laura, and Frank must know about it."

The car hesitated for a moment, then resumed its previous speed.

"Got it!" Tom replied.

Behind the Maybach, police sirens wailed, patrol cars in pursuit. They had run several red lights, nearly causing accidents. Three police cars were now tailing them.

The car didn't slow down, like two condemned men chasing freedom, running towards love and light.

Ahead, a plainly dressed woman waited in the snowstorm.

The car screeched to a halt, followed by the sound of brakes and the continued wail of police sirens.

Tom carried Joseph to Evelyn, gently laying him down. Evelyn cradled Joseph in her arms, unable to hold back her tears.

The snow fell harder, the wind blew stronger.

Evelyn and Joseph lay on the ground, Tom sitting before Joseph, his lips trembling, eyes filled with tears, unable to speak.

"Joseph, we're home," Evelyn whispered, caressing Joseph's face tenderly, as if they were lying in bed on their wedding night.

Joseph nodded weakly, struggling to open his eyes, his mouth moving with effort.

"Do you regret it?"

Evelyn shook her head vigorously, tears falling on his face.

Joseph said, "I'm not a complete man; I'm infertile. What will you do alone in this world..."

"Don't worry, I can't bear to leave you to die alone."

Evelyn's eyes were red as she looked at the approaching police officers, her face twisted with hatred. The officers, sensing something was wrong, kept their distance, the sirens now silent.

Joseph's eyes filled with fear, but his body was too weak to move. He mustered all his strength to squeeze Evelyn's hand and shook his head.

"Don't..." Before Joseph could say more, his eyes slowly closed.

Evelyn held him tightly, not letting go for a moment.

After a long time, Evelyn's hair was covered in snow. Tom, unable to bear it, gently patted her.

She didn't move.

In the snow, a heart-wrenching scream erupted.

At the police station, Tom sat in the interrogation room, his eyes vacant.

The officer across from him had finished the paperwork and understood the situation. He spoke softly, "Given the circumstances, it's understandable, but legally, it's not. Your license is revoked, and you can't reapply for three years. There's also a $1,000 fine."

Tom nodded numbly.

"The deceased... who was he?" The officer asked.

"He was a real man!" Tom's voice was strong and resolute.

###chapter 139 Heartbroken Person

The room was dim and narrow.

A simple bed, a table, and an old green lamp.

A glass of water sat on the table, looking like it had just been poured.

White paper, a pen gliding across it, making a scratching sound that took you back to the days before computers, when writers would lose themselves in their work.

After a long while, the pen tip trembled slightly and stopped.

A cigarette lay quietly on the table.

Alan didn't smoke, but someone did. He knew who.

He gently touched the cigarette, memories flooding back.

The room was eerily quiet, not a sound to be heard. The greatest sorrow isn't loud wailing, but sitting in silence, a heart utterly broken.

Behind him, a sickly man in a wheelchair sat silently, also holding a cigarette.

He was very ill, and even when he wasn't, he didn't smoke.

But someone did. He knew who.

He brought the unlit cigarette to his nose, inhaling its faint scent.

The subtle smell of tobacco reminded him of that brazen person who, knowing he hated the smell, would still fill the room with smoke.

At this moment, he felt a bit dazed, even tempted to light it and taste it.

The two men sat back to back, maintaining a tacit silence.

After a long while, Frank pressed a button on his wheelchair.

He turned, the wheels rolling slowly forward, covering a mere ten feet.

He moved very slowly, as if waiting for something. He had been waiting for a long time, over twenty years. He was patient enough to wait a few more seconds.

What was he waiting for?

Forgiveness? Empathy? Or perhaps, like before, a word of encouragement?

He realized he was foolishly hoping for time to rewind, to return to the past. How ludicrous!

"Frank, do you regret it?" Alan called his name.

The wheelchair stopped, the door already open.

Frank, sitting in the wheelchair, bowed his head in thought. He hadn't expected Alan to ask that.

Regret what?

Regret not killing Ronald, regret not cherishing friendships, regret letting Laura go, regret falling for that woman like a moth to a flame, or perhaps regret being alive?

He was silent, the question weighing heavily on him, making it hard to lift his head.

"I regret being alive."

With that, he left the room, not closing the door this time.

From outside, his voice came. "The door's always been open. You can leave."

Alan was stunned, a bitter expression on his face.

He had always known the door was open.

A sigh echoed through the house.

In another room, with the same layout, three beds made it even more cramped. The oppressive environment made any conversation unbearable.

Especially with two women present.

Tony frowned deeply, looking at the sorrowful Lally, his expression complex.

He had learned of Duke's death from Frank. It was unrelated to anyone else; a drug overdose had triggered a heart complication, and he hadn't been saved in time.

When he heard the news, his instinct was to look at Lally.

Even a good cry would have been better, or throwing a tantrum at Frank. But for three days, Lally hadn't said a word. She occasionally shed tears, refused to eat, and only drank a little water.

Tony hesitated, wanting to say so much, but the words stopped at his lips. He softly said, "Lally, look ahead."

"Look at this, so affectionate. Listen to him calling Lally, Tony, why did you marry me in the first place? Duke's dead, shouldn't you be happy?"

Anna, sitting on the bed against the wall, was fixing her hair, sneering. Her makeup was smeared, her face streaked with tears, looking haggard. The days of captivity hadn't been kind to her.

A woman always loved beauty, even in such circumstances, still tending to her hair.

Anna glanced at Lally sitting in the chair, her eyes full of resentment and jealousy.

"Anna, don't talk nonsense."

Tony frowned, ready to scold her but held back.

"What nonsense? Drug addicts deserve a thousand cuts, dying is what they deserve, saving others from harm. How much money did Duke borrow from you? Did he ever pay it back? If he's not rotting in the street, it must be due to some good deed from a past life."

Anna ranted on, glaring at Tony as she continued.

"You're a useless man, truly pathetic. When Frank came, I didn't hear you say a word. What are you afraid of? And Tom? That ungrateful bastard, the Thompson family raised him for so many years, how could he not know about this? He'd rather be Frank's lackey than look after his own brother. I guess your parents must have done something terrible in their past lives..."

"Enough!"

"Shut up!"

Tony and Lally said in unison.

Anna was clearly startled by their outburst, stunned for a moment, then pointed at them, laughing angrily.

"Look at this, a perfect match united against me. Go ahead, kill me today, I won't even blink!"

She straightened up, tears in her eyes, looking at them with a domineering air.

"Enough." Tony sighed, looking at Anna, his eyes complex. After a long while, he asked, "How did you know about the insurance?"

"What insurance? I don't understand what you're talking about, Tony, don't falsely accuse me!"

Anna instantly got angry.

"Falsely accuse?" Lally, who hadn't spoken, stared at Anna, her voice hoarse. "You killed Tammy for that insurance, didn't you? Mind your own business, you widow! You whore, slept with countless men! I'm talking to my husband, why are you butting in?"

Anna spat venomously, like a shrew, hitting where it hurt most.

Lally was stunned, never expecting Anna to say such things. She held back her grief, standing tall.

"When I was young, Tammy was kind to me. The entire Thompson family was good to me. Of course, I have to speak up! My misfortune isn't anyone's fault, unlike some people who..."

Anna rushed over and slapped Lally hard.

As she reached out again, her arm was caught, like a steel clamp gripping her, the intense pain like an electric shock.

"Tony, how dare you stop me!" Anna roared, "Tell me, how did you know about the insurance? I want you to tell me, did you kill my mom yourself?"

###chapter 140 Displacement

"Yeah, you got it all figured out! So, what now? You gonna kill me?"

Anna's hair was a tangled mess, and she was hysterically rolling on the floor, laughing one moment and crying the next.

"Why..." Tony slumped to the ground, defeated.

"Why? Did I, Anna, ever have a good day after marrying you, this useless man? You two put on quite a show. I wondered why the compensation for the Sand Village demolition fight never came through. I wondered why Nancy suddenly went silent. Turns out the compensation had already been paid, and you used it to buy a huge insurance policy for your mom. You're such a dutiful son. What about me? What about me?"

Anna pounded her chest, spitting as she screamed.

"I came to your house, and what did you give me? Didn't I help you find your job? Wasn't it my live streaming, acting like a clown in front of the camera, that kept us afloat? What did I ever do wrong to you? And now, you're planning to die, right? Is the Entertainment Club murder case related to you? I misjudged you. I didn't expect you to be so heartless. If you die, your mom gets the money, and I continue to sell my dignity?"

Anna added, "Yes, I had thoughts, but I didn't kill her. She's lying in the hospital just fine. She never liked me since I married you."

Tony watched quietly the hysterical Anna, his expression growing colder.

He never imagined that the woman he had risked everything to save from that room, naked and vulnerable, would turn out like this. He had married Anna despite Tammy and Tom's objections, hoping to give her a new life. Was it all a mistake?

He couldn't understand, or perhaps he didn't want to. He remembered the despair and rage he felt when he saw Lally being stripped and abused by a group of men. He had wanted to tear them apart but ended up beaten and bruised, returning home in silence.

From that moment, he swore he would never witness such a scene again, even if it cost him his life.

It was all a misalignment of fate.

The day he went to find Lally, he saw Anna being stripped in a room. He saved her without hesitation, but it plunged his soul into an abyss.

The door opened.

Frank, in a wheelchair, slowly entered, his sickly face showing no emotion.

Lally glanced at him, a flicker of joy quickly replaced by endless sorrow and sadness.

Anna's eyes darted around, remaining silent.

Frank's gaze lingered on Tony and Lally, not sparing Anna a glance, as if she were invisible.

"Your task is complete."

Frank's eyes finally fell on Anna.

Tony's head snapped up, and Lally looked at Frank in disbelief.

"Frank, what do you mean?"

Frank didn't respond, just looked at Anna emotionlessly, repeating.

"Your task is complete. Laura is out. The person who promised you money was Ronald, right? Well, he won't be able to pay you. He's going to die soon."

"No!" Anna crawled over to Tony, clinging to him, sobbing. "I'm not going anywhere. I want to stay with him."

Tony looked at Anna and Frank in disbelief, his mind blank, unable to process what was happening.

"It is never beneficial to immerse oneself too deeply into the role."

Frank looked deeply at Anna, his words carrying an undeniable authority.

"I beg you, I don't want the money. I just want to stay with him." Anna crawled over, clutching Frank's wheelchair, pleading.

"Tony, I don't know you well, but I've been in contact with your father over the years. I owe him a great debt. You and Tom are like brothers, even without blood ties. I understand that. And your relationship with Lally... In short, I see you as one of my own." Frank said.

Tony stood up abruptly, eyes wide, looking at Frank in disbelief. When Frank smiled gently and nodded, tears streamed down Tony's face as he choked out. "My dad... He's still alive... Where is he?"

"Mr. Thompson is still alive?" Lally's spirits lifted, her surprise evident.

"Yes, he didn't die in that fire years ago. Ronald betrayed him and tried to kill him. When news of George's death came out, he didn't believe it. He had Douglas, the Entertainment Club owner, and Anna stage this whole act, forcing your father out. This marriage was a sham from the start." Frank said solemnly, patting Tony's shoulder.

Frank continued, "Only I, Tom, Bob, and Mike knew about this. We didn't tell you to protect Mr. Thompson. Keeping you here was to keep you safe from Ronald. It's been tough on you."

Lally's eyes grew colder. Frank seemed increasingly unfamiliar. His perfect words hid one person: Laura.

She and Tony were captured because they wanted to tell Nancy the old steel mill's secret. Frank discovered this and intervened. How did the narrative change to Frank's self-sacrifice for their sake?

"Hypocrite... You monsters are all the same!" Anna pointed at Frank, trembling with fear.

"This world is too complex to explain in a single sentence. It's like a web, full of entanglements and grudges. Anna, you can leave now." Frank smiled faintly.

His first message revealed Anna as Ronald's spy, stripping Tony of his trust in her. The second message revealed George was alive, implying Frank's sacrifices for the Thompson family's survival, drawing Tony to his side.

No matter what Anna said now, it was futile.

"Go, leave with some dignity." Frank said, then slowly left. 

Anna looked at Lally and Tony, suddenly smiling with relief. She stood up, pushing Frank's wheelchair, and slowly left.

"Anna, where are you going?" Tony stood up to stop her.

"Tony, the game is over." Anna smiled, turned back, and walked away.

###chapter 141 Fleeing for Life

The highway exit between Shadow City and Silverlight City.

The roadside barrier had been smashed open. Luckily, the surrounding fields were flat; if it had been an overpass, Zoey and I might not have made it.

I floored the gas pedal, aiming for the nearest populated area. The GPS showed a small town about a mile or two away. Gripping the steering wheel tightly, I sped straight ahead.

In the rearview mirror, the van was still hot on our tail.

"Ms. Johnson, could the car chasing us be my dad's?" Zoey asked, her face pale but trying to stay calm.

"No way," I shook my head. "Even if Ronald had lost his mind, he wouldn't risk his own daughter's life like this."

I figured it was someone with a vested interest in Ronald, trying to silence us and make it look like a traffic accident. I had been careful enough to rent a car myself instead of hiring a driver, but they still managed to tamper with it.

How did they find out we were coming back?

Only a few people knew about this trip, besides our group, only Leonard. None of them would leak the information.

Erica!

It hit me suddenly. Zoey's call with Erica must have been monitored. They knew Ronald's daughter and wife were involved, and there was only one local car rental service, allowing them to react so quickly.

Could Howard's unavailability be related to these people, or was it just Ronald's doing?

At this moment, all I could do was pray.

"Ms. Johnson, I just messaged Bob, saying our car had a minor issue and we were getting it fixed in the next town. I told them to be careful."

"Good job. And then?" I nodded, having been too busy driving to send any messages myself.

"Then I messaged Ruben, saying the car was on its way and asked him to divert nearby highway patrol cars to escort us. He replied that the police from the next town were already on their way and would meet us at the toll station in about ten minutes." Zoey said seriously.

"Great, that ensures Bob and Mr. Thompson's safety."

The gas tank was nearly empty. We might run out of fuel after crossing the next bridge.

The map showed the river was a tributary of the town's moat. I had visited here during college; the river wasn't too deep. Following it downstream would lead us to the local winter swimming club.

"Ms. Johnson, they're catching up!"

A loud bang jolted us forward. The van had caught up and was ramming our car.

Zoey was terrified, her nerves finally breaking. She looked at me in panic.

"Zoey, how was your college swimming record?"

I remembered seeing on her resume that she was the runner-up in Silverlight University's swimming competition.

"Ms. Johnson, you mean...?"

"See that bridge up ahead? I've unlocked the doors and unfastened my seatbelt. When I count to three, open the door and jump off the bridge. Swim downstream for about ten minutes, and you'll reach the winter swimming club."

"Got it!" Zoey responded decisively.

I nodded, revving the engine to keep the car moving forward. As we neared the bridge...

"One..."

"Two..."

Seeing the van about to pull alongside us, I swerved sharply, causing the rear of our car to collide with the van, pushing it towards the bridge edge. With a screech of brakes, the van hung precariously off the bridge.

"Three... Jump!"

Zoey and I leaped out of the car, diving off the bridge!

As we hit the water, I heard gunshots hitting our car. The van was riddled with bullets.

Good thing we chose to jump; otherwise, we wouldn't have survived.

The river was about 10 feet deep. Underwater, I saw Zoey give me an OK sign, indicating she had landed safely. I pointed ahead, signaling to swim underwater for about 100 feet before surfacing to avoid detection.

While catching my breath, I glanced back at the bridge. The pursuers were on the phone, which gave me some relief.

We swam to the winter swimming club, where a competition was underway. Seeing two women swimming towards them, the participants thought we needed rescuing and quickly helped us ashore.

Zoey cleverly explained that she had just started learning to swim and accidentally fell in while practicing with her sister. I couldn't help but smile at her quick thinking.

Feeling safe and relieved, we temporarily forgot the tension from the chase. I checked my phone, thankful it was still working.

The club members were very kind, giving us coats and driving us to a nearby hotel. We bought new clothes on the way, and since Zoey and I were similar in size, we got matching outfits.

After thanking our rescuers and exchanging contact information, we took hot showers, changed into dry clothes, and ordered dinner at the hotel.

"Ms. Johnson, I finally understand what it feels like to survive a disaster!" Zoey said, patting her chest in relief.

I exhaled deeply, nodding. This was the first time I had experienced something like this. It was hard to believe that scenes from action movies had played out in real life.

Just then, my phone rang. It was Ruben.

"Hello, Ms. Johnson, are you okay?" he asked urgently.

"Me? I'm fine. Just getting the car fixed," I replied, signaling Zoey to keep quiet about our ordeal.

"Where are you? Ms. Johnson, don't hide it from me. Rest assured, we've deployed four fully armed police cars to escort the ambulance. Not even a fly will get near it!"

###chapter 142 Is Frank Dead?

Ruben hesitated on the other end of the line for a long time before stammering out, "Uh, Ms. Johnson..."

"Hey, what's up?"

"Is Zoey there?"

This was unusual for Ruben. Normally, he'd be more straightforward, either asking me directly or calling Zoey himself.

I glanced at Zoey, who was on the phone with Erica, letting her know she was safe. Zoey seemed to sense my gaze and, realizing it was Ruben asking about her, she looked a bit flustered. She waved her hand repeatedly, but a small, involuntary smile flickered across her lips.

"Yeah, she's here. She's on the phone with her mom right now. Want me to pass on a message?"

I smiled to myself. When it came to relationships, I was inexperienced. Alan was my first love in college, and we got married without any other romantic experiences. These two seemed a bit childish, and I couldn't predict how things would develop. But Zoey's unintentional smile made me wonder if there was something more.

Wait, weren't these two supposed to be just friends?

I really didn't understand young people these days.

There was a commotion on the other end of the line, and it sounded like someone had grabbed the phone from Ruben, followed by a yelp from him. Then I heard Benjamin's angry voice.

"Seriously, Ruben? You're still thinking about Zoey? You know you don't stand a chance, right? You made a fool of yourself last time at her office!"

"I didn't think it was embarrassing," Ruben replied, sounding hurt.

"Of course you didn't. I was the one embarrassed!"

These two... It seemed like Benjamin was recovering well. It had only been a couple of days, but his resilience was impressive, a testament to his career as a detective.

Leonard had mentioned that Benjamin wasn't seriously injured. Most of his wounds were superficial, and his main issue was exhaustion from prolonged stress. In a way, his coma was more of a deep rest.

"Hey, Nancy. How are you holding up? You were amazing back there, like a professional stuntwoman. You should consider joining our detective team. We need someone with your skills!"

Benjamin's voice was strong and joking, which reassured me.

"Are you okay? And what about Cindy?" I asked. 

Cindy was about to give birth, and we had kept Benjamin's coma a secret from her for safety reasons. Only his parents and Ruben knew, and they had told Cindy that Benjamin hadn't returned to Silverlight City yet.

There was another yelp from Ruben, probably from another kick from Benjamin.

"I'm fine, just needed some rest. Cindy found out I was back in Silverlight City the day after I arrived."

"What? I thought only your parents knew?" I aksed with astonishment.

"Yeah, but Cindy somehow found out and called Ruben. His loose lips spilled the beans after just a few questions. I can't believe I trained him!" Benjamin sounded exasperated but also happy.

"I think Cindy is stronger than she looks." I smiled.

Cindy was known for her calm demeanor in college. She rarely got flustered and was very steady.

"Absolutely!" Benjamin said proudly, "Cindy brought all her essentials to the hospital and registered for a room in advance. She stayed there every night and sat by my bed during the day. The first person I saw when I woke up was Cindy."

Benjamin added, "She may seem delicate, but she really stepped up, even with her pregnancy."

I felt a pang of guilt.

Benjamin had been reassigned for a case, and it seemed he wasn't coming back. But he had uncovered the mastermind, Ronald, and I had found the child trafficking ring's base thanks to Cindy's mom, Jody.

"Benjamin, I'm sorry you both had to go through this. I feel responsible."

"No need, Nancy." On the phone, Benjamin became serious and earnestly said, "This is more than just about you. It's a case spanning over twenty years. I'm a cop; it's my duty and mission to see it through. Even if it costs me my life, I have no regrets. I swore an oath to serve and protect."

"Understood." I nodded firmly.

Ruben called out, sounding urgent. Benjamin told me to hold on and not hang up.

I sensed something had changed. How could so much happen in just two days away from Silverlight City?

"Hey, Nancy? You still there?" Benjamin asked.

"Yes, go ahead."

Benjamin hesitated, "Two things. We just got some news. First, Frank... is dead."

I was stunned. Frank was dead?

My first thought wasn't Ronald or anyone else, but Alan.

I had been certain that Ronald had captured Alan, not to kill him but to keep him from interfering. Ronald wanted to prove he was the best among their childhood group.

Now, with Frank dead, Alan's safety was uncertain.

"Who did it? Ronald?"

There was a pause before Benjamin replied, "Anna, Tony's wife."

"Anna?"

Everything clicked into place. Anna, Laura, Frank, Ronald... there had been a falling out.

But that wasn't important.

"What about Alan?" I asked urgently.

"Well..." Benjamin sounded puzzled. "Do you know how I found out about Frank?"

"Tell me."

"Ruben was handling his discharge papers when a man approached him and told him. When Ruben asked who he was, the man said..."

Benjamin's voice was filled with relief and joy. "Alan Smith."

###chapter 143 Confusion

"Ruben saw Alan?"

So, Alan was safe!

A wave of relief washed over me as I tried to calm down. "He didn't come up? Where'd he go?"

If Alan knew about Benjamin, he must've contacted one of us. Probably... Leonard?

But that didn't add up. If Alan had reached out to Leonard, Leonard would've told me.

So who could it be?

"He said he had other stuff to handle, so he didn't come up."

What could that be?

Alan wasn't the type to go after Ronald. So who did he go see?

Laura? No way. She lost it and was released without charges. No one knew where she was now.

Could it be Tom?

Alan shouldn't know the secret about George being alive. So why would he go to Tom?

Benjamin interrupted my thoughts, "The second thing. Remember the coroner who did Douglas's autopsy? He was your junior in college."

"Yeah, Joseph. I remember."

A sense of dread settled over me.

"He died a few days ago. He and his wife were found dead outside their apartment in the snow. Apparently, Joseph had just left a hotel when it happened. Tom ran red lights to get him to his wife Evelyn, but she took her own life after seeing him."

I was stunned.

Zoey noticed my expression and gave me a concerned look, gently patting my shoulder.

"Nancy, you still there?"

"I'm here."

The last time I saw Joseph was over ten years after graduation, the night of the Entertainment Club incident. He had warned me about the strangeness of the case. When I saw him again, he was being taken away for questioning. He left a message for his wife Evelyn to give to me. That incident opened my eyes to Ronald's true nature.

Joseph hadn't changed. Despite a rough childhood and being used by others in his career, he remained kind and just. Whether as a gentle young man or a slightly overweight middle-aged man, he never lost his integrity and hope.

He was loyal to friendship, justice, and freedom.

Meeting Evelyn was the one grace fate granted him. She stood like a statue in the cold wind outside the courthouse, confronting the powers that be, all for the sake of bringing Joseph home.

Now, it was all over.

"I understand." I replied quietly.

My heart was a mix of emotions. After getting the details, I hung up the phone.

Frank's death seemed too suspicious. Could it be faked?

Alan told Ruben he saw Anna push Frank down the stairs. By the time Alan got there, Frank was already dead. Anna had a clear motive, and it seemed likely that Ronald orchestrated it, with Laura directing Anna to get close to Tony to force George out of hiding.

From another perspective, since I saw Frank again ten years after college, his health had been deteriorating. His pale face and weak breath couldn't be faked. With such a frail body, the impact from Anna pushing him down the stairs could have been fatal.

That made sense. Where have Tony, Anna, and Lally, who were controlled by Frank, gone now?

And where did Alan go? Benjamin had interrupted my thoughts earlier. Would Alan really go to Tom? And if he found Tom, for what reason?

Moreover, if Frank was dead, why hadn't Tom, a key member of the plan, made any moves?

Just when I thought we were nearing the end, things became even more confusing. I texted Benjamin to check on the whereabouts of them. I was worried that after escaping Frank's control, they might fall into Ronald's hands.

That could be disastrous.

I called Tom. The last time we spoke was when I found out he and Zack were the same person.

Alan's whereabouts, the other three's locations, and Howard... they might all be connected to him.

I even suspected that Tom, like Howard and Frank, had more than just a business relationship and was tied to the old case from over twenty years ago.

I made several calls, but no one answered.

Zoey and Erica had finished their call. They seemed to have talked a lot. Zoey looked in better spirits, probably comforted by Erica, temporarily forgetting the pain Ronald had caused her. More importantly, Erica hadn't told her about Howard's disappearance.

"Did you check in with your mom?"

I pulled myself out of my thoughts and smiled at Zoey, who seemed in a better mood.

Zoey blinked and nodded, "Yeah. I talked to her about Dad. She was very honest. She said their divorce wasn't because of anything wrong with Dad, just that the long-distance and busy lives made their feelings fade. She said people have to take responsibility for their choices. If I worry too much about Dad or try to do something for him, it might actually harm him. The sooner he comes clean, the better his chances of avoiding the worst outcome. It might not be a death sentence, and we could still see him again."

I nodded. Erica hadn't offered emotional comfort but had analyzed the worst-case scenario. This was the wisdom and calm of someone seasoned in business, and the greatest love a mother could give her daughter.

"And she said she just met with Mr. Martin to discuss legal matters. He thinks that if Dad cooperates and reveals the higher-ups and others involved, he might get a reduced sentence. There's a good chance it could be commuted to life imprisonment. After all, Dad was a good person once. He'll find his way back."

Wait... Howard met with Erica? But Howard was missing, wasn't he?

In such a serious case, Ronald wouldn't have any chance of leniency if caught.

Howard had once joked that he had forgotten all his legal knowledge over the past twenty years, saying his mind was now full of money and he would never deal with any cases again.

So, was Erica lying to Zoey, or had Howard not disappeared and was hiding?

Just then, Leonard sent a message.
