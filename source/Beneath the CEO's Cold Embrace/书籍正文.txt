###chapter 1 The Daughter of A Murderer
********
Branded a murderer's daughter, Victoria sells her body to a ruthless CEO for survival. Trapped between his cruel obsession and a vengeful fiancée, she fights to uncover a family secret. Can she escape his grip, or will their twisted passion destroy her?
********
In the bustling coffee shop, she clutched her swollen cheek, the sting of the slap still fresh, yet she had no desire to retaliate. The onlookers around her cast scornful and disdainful glances, none stepping forward to help. Because she was Alvin Carter's daughter, they believed she deserved it.
"Victoria, your father killed so many people, and you still have the nerve to criticize me? If I were you, I'd be too ashamed to show my face!" Ella Garcia sneered.
Victoria Carter bowed her head in shame, her voice barely a whisper. "I'm sorry, Miss Garcia, I misspoke. I apologize."
"Apologize? That's how you apologize to me? I sent you to the Honeycomb Cottage to buy a cake, and you made me wait forever, and this cake tastes awful! Do you think I'll accept this? What a joke!" Ella said angrily. "I am the heiress of the Garcia family, William Scott's fiancée! Even if I throw away a hundred, a thousand cakes, it's not your place to criticize!"
Victoria lowered her eyes, a bitter smile tugging at her lips. Faced with Ella's unreasonable accusations, she dared not retort. Even when she was the heiress of the Carter family, she had no right to get angry with Ella. And now, with Alvin arrested and her mother Nora Adams hospitalized due to stress, it was even less possible.
Not to mention a slap, if needed, she had to endure dozens!
Seeing Victoria remain silent, Ella grew even angrier. She grabbed a coffee cup from the table and smashed it against Victoria's head. "You're the daughter of a murderer, why don't you just die?"
The cup shattered on the floor, hot coffee splashing onto Victoria's delicate cheek, bringing searing pain. She bit her lip tightly, not daring to make a sound, but felt a wave of dizziness.
Ella, seeing her pitiful state, grew more furious. She picked up her bag from the table, ready to strike Victoria again.
"Stop!" A man's voice commanded.
Ella turned to see the man who had burst through the door, a flash of surprise and joy in her eyes. She rushed to his side, clinging to his arm, and complained coquettishly, "William! You're finally here, this Victoria nearly drove me mad."
The man walked in, carrying a bouquet of roses, which he handed to Ella. He gently played with her long curls, speaking softly, "Sweetheart, there's no need to get upset with her. She's just an insignificant secretary. I'll make her apologize to you."
Victoria, covered in coffee stains and blushing with embarrassment, stood awkwardly to the side. Hearing his tender words, she felt a chill run through her and glanced at him.
Sunlight poured through the large windows, highlighting his broad shoulders, narrow waist, and tall, sculpted physique-like a masterpiece of the gods.
Victoria's eyes stung, her heart wrenching painfully.
This man was William Scott, her current sugar daddy and the heir to the Scott family. Just this morning, they had been intimately entwined in the Scott Group's office. Now, he was demanding she apologize to his fiancée, Ella.
"Apologize to Ella!" William's voice turned icy.
Victoria bit her lip, her eyes reddening, her body trembling, but she stubbornly refused to apologize in front of him.
William's jaw tightened as he stared at her, swallowing hard.
"Didn't you hear? William told you to apologize to me, or I'll have him fire you. Then how will you pay for your mother's medical bills?" Ella commanded arrogantly, raising an eyebrow at Victoria.
Victoria took a deep breath, clenching her teeth, tears finally streaming down her cheeks. "I'm sorry," she choked out, bowing humbly.
Ella was right. If Victoria angered William, she would lose her livelihood. How would she then pay for Nora's medical bills, her brother Bobby Carter's tuition, and Alvin's enormous debts?
"Victoria, you're a disgrace!" Ella sneered.
Hearing this, Victoria kept her head down, tears falling steadily to the floor.
William watched Victoria, her white dress soaked with coffee, clinging to her body, revealing her perfect curves. He felt his blood boil. Cursing silently, he clenched his fists tightly, taking a deep breath to suppress his urges.
"Ella, you should go now. I have some work to handle," William said coldly, regaining his composure.
"Alright." Ella glanced at him, a hint of reluctance in her eyes, then nodded sweetly and left the coffee shop.
William walked towards Victoria, towering over her. His eyes narrowed, his gaze deepening with desire.
Victoria felt the intense, predatory gaze and looked up at him, asking, "Mr. Scott?"
William's eyes narrowed as he grabbed Victoria, pulling her into the coffee shop's restroom. He kicked open a stall door and pressed her against it.
His tall, imposing body pinned her down, his breath hot on her face. "You look so enticing, I can't resist." With that, his thin lips covered hers, biting down hard with a punishing force.
Victoria's eyes widened, staring at his handsome face so close to hers, her mind blank. William's kiss grew more urgent, as if he wanted to devour her completely.
He kissed her as if he were a wild animal savoring a rare treat. Victoria's hands were pinned against the cold wall, unable to break free, the pain unbearable.
"Let go... you're hurting me!" Her weak protest only fueled William's fervor. He pressed his body tighter against hers, his rock-hard abs and the unmistakable bulge in his pants pressing against her abdomen.
William's hand cupped her bottom, the other roughly kneading her breasts, popping open her blouse buttons.
Just as he was about to strip off her blouse, the sound of the door opening outside interrupted them.
###chapter 2 Hand Over the Money
Hearing the sounds outside, Victoria snapped back to reality, her eyes wide with fear. She pushed at William, urgently whispering, "Not here... someone might see us... please..."

William ignored her pleas, deaf to the noise outside. He roughly tore off her clothes, exposing her full breasts and the slender curve of her waist.

"William, please let go of me..." she begged, her voice trembling with embarrassment.

William turned her around and bent her over the toilet. He leaned down, kissing her neck, his hands roaming over her curves. "Baby," he murmured, his voice dripping with desire, like a devil tempting her.

Victoria felt her thoughts scatter, a shiver running through her body, making her weak and powerless.

"William..." she trembled, her voice shaking.

Hearing her voice, William felt his blood boil, unable to control himself any longer. He took her roughly.

"William... uh... ahhh..."

Victoria's voice was hoarse, trembling with moans. Her nails dug into her own skin as she bit her lip, struggling to endure the pain of his rough entry. Seeing her struggle only excited William more, making him even rougher.

Outside, people heard the commotion, speculating about what was happening inside. A few sleazy guys next door started making lewd comments.

"Man, you guys are on fire in there."

"I bet she's a virgin!"

"Yeah, with those awkward moans, she definitely doesn't have much experience."

Hearing these filthy words, Victoria was jolted awake, her face turning pale. Not wanting to endure this humiliation any longer, she tried to push William away with all her might, but he was too excited, continuing his relentless thrusts.

"Please, let me go," she cried, tears streaming down her face. Her legs felt like they were filled with lead, powerless, leaving her helplessly lying there.

William ignored her, becoming even more frenzied, taking her like a beast. Each thrust brought unbearable pain. She pounded his chest with her fists, hoping to make him stop, but her efforts only added to his pleasure.

Finally, Victoria, numb, felt the wet, sticky sensation inside her as William finished, slowly letting her go.

He looked down at her with a satisfied grin, licking his lips. "That was amazing."

Victoria lay on the cold toilet seat, gasping for breath.

William adjusted his clothes, looking down at her with a dark expression. "I'm in a good mood today, so I won't hold this against you. But if you ever upset my fiancée again, you know what will happen." He pulled out his wallet, tossing a card on the ground, and patted her cheek.

"Here's a hundred grand for this month. Be a good girl and come when I call. Pay off your father's million-dollar debt as soon as possible." With that, he walked out, his polished shoes clicking on the floor.

Victoria trembled, picking up the card in humiliation. She slowly stood up, straightening herself, and staggered out of the restroom.

She went to the hospital and used the card to pay Nora's overdue medical bills. As she reached the door of the hospital room, she heard Nora's cheerful laughter inside.

Victoria's nerves tightened, her hands gripping the door handle, veins bulging, knuckles white. She knew the only person who could make Nora this happy was Bobby.

She pushed the door open and walked straight in. Sure enough, Bobby was sitting by the bed, chatting warmly with Nora.

Bobby looked up and saw Victoria enter, a hint of mockery flashing in his eyes before he quickly masked it with a smile. "Victoria, you're here," he greeted with a warm grin, but his smugness still peeked through.

Victoria shot him a cold glance and nodded.

Seeing Victoria's cold attitude towards Bobby, Nora was furious. "You're such a pest! Your brother's so great, and you still treat him with a sour face? What's your problem?"

Her eyes were clouded with undisguised loathing as if Victoria was the most repulsive person in the world.

Bobby quickly held Nora's hand, comforting her. "Mom, it's okay. Don't blame Victoria, she's always been like this."

"You are so considerate," Nora said, looking at Bobby with admiration, then turned to glare at Victoria. "You ungrateful thing, you're not even half as good as Bobby."

Victoria was used to Nora's favoritism towards Bobby and didn't argue. She quietly cleaned up the room's trash and said, "I've paid the overdue medical bills. Take care of yourself."

"Paying it off so late, what a disgrace," Nora sneered, then turned to Bobby with a warm smile. "Bobby, I heard your painting won second place in the national competition. You're amazing! You really inherited my talent!"

Nora had been a well-known painter over twenty years ago, but an accident damaged her hand and ended her painting career. Since then, she had harbored resentment towards Victoria, convinced that Victoria's birth was the source of her misfortune.

However, she pinned all her hopes on Bobby, seeing him as the extension of her artistic life.

Bobby's smile froze for a moment but quickly returned to normal. "Thank you, Mom. It's nothing."

Victoria paused her cleaning, listening to their conversation. Bobby's painting skills were not even half as good as hers, yet he had won second place in the national competition?

"By the way, you need to submit a portfolio in the second half of the year. How's that coming along?" Nora asked with concern.

Bobby's face showed unease, nervously twisting his clothes and lowering his head. "Actually, I..."

Seeing Bobby's hesitation, Nora became anxious. "Bobby, what's wrong?"

Victoria stood by the door, coldly watching Nora and Bobby's affectionate performance, a mocking smile on her lips.

"Mom, the teacher said that with my current level, it's still risky to get into an art university. It's best to attend the training class held by the professors from that university to improve my chances of getting accepted." Bobby explained, his eyes reddening, biting his lip, looking very dejected.

Nora was stunned, then immediately worried. "How can this be? Didn't you win second place in the national competition?"

"The art university has many internal factions, and without connections, it's impossible to get in. This training class is just a way for the professors to collect bribes and reserve spots for those who can pay. But the cost is too high, it needs two hundred thousand, and with our current situation..." Bobby bit his lip, speaking with a sense of grievance, while his eyes involuntarily darted towards Victoria. 

"Victoria has money!" Nora turned to Victoria, urgently commanding, "Victoria, go get two hundred thousand for Bobby immediately!"

Victoria remained expressionless, as if she hadn't heard anything. Two hundred thousand? Did they think she was a bank?

It was the same old trick of acting pitiful to gain sympathy. Victoria was all too familiar with it and didn't even bother to respond.
###chapter 3 You Can't Escape
"Victoria!" Nora's voice rang out, filled with fury. "Didn't you hear me talking to you?"

Victoria stopped in her tracks, her back still to Nora. "I won't give you the money," she said calmly.

"You brat! How dare you defy me now?" Nora leapt from the bed, grabbing Victoria's arm and delivering a stinging slap across her face.
Victoria endured the blow, her lips pressed tightly together, eyes full of defiance. 

After a moment, she spoke hoarsely, "Mom, I'm just a college dropout. I've done everything I can to pay your medical bills. Ever since Dad's accident, you've been in the hospital. I've given up all my pride and taken those dead-end jobs just to cover your medical bills. We lost our house, and I've slept under bridges and in basements. But did you ever care about me even once? In your heart, is it only Bobby who's your child, while I'm just a stepping stone for him?"

Nora was momentarily speechless, then reluctantly let go of Victoria. "Why do you have to be so dramatic? I know you have money. Give Bobby the two hundred grand. If his education is delayed, you'll regret it!"

Victoria felt a sharp pang in her heart, her mind flooded with a wave of sorrow. She clenched her lower lip tightly, biting down so hard that the taste of blood filled her mouth. She closed her eyes, struggling to suppress the churning emotions, and it took several deep breaths to push back the lump in her throat.

"Mom, you knew all along," Victoria slowly opened her eyes, looking at Nora's startled face. "You know where my money comes from..."
It was money earned at the cost of her dignity. 

Her eyes were brimming with pain and disbelief, but she couldn't get the rest of the words past the lump in her throat.

Victoria swallowed hard, her mouth filled with bitterness. "If you know this, how can you expect me to pay for Bobby's training?" she asked.
Nora avoided Victoria's sharp gaze, her voice stubborn. "What's the difference between selling your body once and selling it multiple times? Why are you pretending to be so pure now?"

Victoria let out a bitter laugh. Was this something a mother should say to her daughter? Unable to stay in that suffocating room any longer, she pushed past Nora and stumbled out of the hospital room.

Watching Victoria's retreating back, Nora felt a surge of anger. She kicked the leg of the table hard, shouting, "Victoria, you ungrateful wretch! Come back here!"

The next day, after finishing her shift at Scott Group, Victoria rushed to her part-time job at a clothing store. She worked until nearly ten o'clock when the store owner called her.

"Victoria," the owner said, sounding urgent. "I need you to get these dresses to room 404 at the Starry Nights Hotel, right away. The customer's waiting, so don't mess around. If we nail this sale, I'll double your commission."

The store often had custom orders that needed delivery. Victoria picked up the dresses and hurried to the hotel.

She easily found the room and knocked on the door. A woman in a business suit opened the door, smiling warmly. "You're here with the dresses, right? Come in."

"Thank you," Victoria said, stepping inside with the bags.

As soon as she entered, a pungent mix of smoke and alcohol hit her like a wall. She sensed something was wrong and turned to leave, but the door clicked shut behind her. The woman had locked it from the outside.

In the spacious bedroom, four lecherous men were seated, their eyes glinting with a repulsive, predatory lust as they roamed over her body.

Victoria's heart raced with fear. She instinctively took a step back, and the bags in her hand nearly slipped from her grasp. She clutched the bags tightly, glaring at them. "Who are you?" she stammered.

One of the men stubbed out his cigarette, his gaze lingering on her. He licked his lips. "What a beauty. Today is my lucky day."

As he spoke, he actually reached out to touch Victoria's face. His fingers, rough and greasy, were inches from her skin.

Victoria took a big step back and snapped, "Let me leave. Now. Or I'll call the police!"

"Feisty, aren't you?" the man chuckled, clicking his tongue in approval. "What's your name?"

Despite her fear, Victoria tried to remain calm. "I'm sorry, but I don't provide that kind of service," she said, grabbing the bags and heading for the door.

But the four men blocked her way. A burly man named Clifford warned, "Don't make me use force."

The men closed in, cutting off her escape. Victoria's hands trembled as she discreetly reached into her pocket, pressing a random button, praying for a miracle.

It seemed her prayers were answered as she heard a man's voice on the other end of the line. Without waiting for him to speak, she quickly said, "I'm in room 404 at the Starry Nights Hotel. Please help..."

Before she could finish, one of the men snatched her phone and smashed it to pieces.

"What do you want?" Victoria screamed, her voice shaking with terror.

"What do you think?" Clifford sneered, advancing on her. "I've been waiting for you. Be a good girl and cooperate." Then he lunged at Victoria, eager and impatient.

Victoria tried to evade him, but it was useless. She struggled with all her might. Her fingernails dug into Clifford's forearm, leaving deep, bloody scratches. 

Clifford winced in pain, but his anger only intensified. He pinned her to the ground, tearing at her thin blouse, leaving red marks on her skin with his rough hands.

"Help!" Victoria cried, her vision blurred by tears. She struggled, but Clifford was too strong. He held her down, a sick smile on his face as he unbuckled his belt. "You'll enjoy this soon enough!"

As Clifford's hand reached for her, Victoria bit down hard on his arm. He screamed in pain, raising his hand to strike her. In desperation, Victoria grabbed his wrist and yanked, causing him to lose his balance and fall onto the bed.

Seizing the opportunity, Victoria crawled towards the balcony. "If you come any closer, I'll jump!" she shouted, her voice filled with desperation.
The men hesitated, not wanting to cause a scene. Clifford, clutching his bitten arm, cursed, "Bitch, I'll kill you!"

"Don't jump. I'll open the door and let you go, okay?" a skinny man with a scar on his eyebrow, Dean, approached and slightly opened the door.

Victoria glanced at the ground below, then at the slightly open door. Her heart raced, but her will to survive prevailed. "You all go to the bathroom. I'll leave on my own!" she demanded.

Clifford and the others exchanged glances, reluctantly heading to the bathroom. Victoria took a deep breath, feeling a glimmer of hope. She quickly ran towards the door.

Just as she was about to open it, the door slammed shut and locked from the outside. Victoria's heart sank. She pounded on the door, screaming, "Why did you lock the door? Open it! Help!"

The woman who had let her in was still guarding outside. Victoria collapsed to the floor in despair, staring at the closed door.

Behind her, the four men emerged from the bathroom, evil smiles on their faces, slowly advancing towards her.
###chapter 4 How Dare You Hurt Her?

The bathroom door slammed shut, and the sound of it closing hit her heart like a sledgehammer.

"Stop fighting, you can't get away! Behave, and maybe it won't be so bad," Clifford said, reaching out to grab Victoria's thigh.

Victoria kicked him hard. Clifford, wincing in pain, angrily raised his hand and slapped her across the face.

Her cheek swelled up instantly, a bit of blood trickling from the corner of her mouth, and the pain made her head spin. Tears filled her eyes, and she started trembling uncontrollably.

The men began tearing at her clothes, leaving her outfit in shreds. She fought with everything she had, but she was no match for them.

Her clothes were ripped apart, exposing her skin to the cold air, a wave of humiliation and helplessness washing over her.

She screamed desperately, "Let me go! Help!"

But the room was soundproof, and no one could hear her cries. She felt like she was falling into a bottomless pit.

"Let's see how long you can keep this up," Dean sneered. He shoved Victoria to the ground, leaving her almost completely exposed, and then pinned her down.

Victoria fought back fiercely, kneeing Dean in the groin. Dean howled in pain, got up, and started punching and kicking her.

Victoria felt like her body was being torn apart, the pain nearly making her pass out. She curled up into a ball, trying to protect herself, but the blows kept coming, hitting her body and head mercilessly.

Each hit felt like a sledgehammer, making it hard for her to breathe. Her face was covered in tears and blood, and she started seeing stars, her consciousness fading.

Just as she was about to lose hope, the door to the room was kicked open.

William stormed in with a team of imposing bodyguards. He froze when he saw Victoria being beaten and assaulted. An uncontrollable rage surged from his heart to his head. His face darkened, exuding a chilling aura.

"Who gave you the right to hurt her?" William roared, his voice echoing through the room.

The four men shuddered in fear. Their arrogance vanished instantly upon seeing William and his bodyguards, and their faces turned pale.

Dean stammered, "Who are you?" His voice was filled with fear, and he could barely speak coherently.

A flash of bloodthirsty rage crossed William's eyes as he signaled the bodyguards to drag Dean over. With a swift motion, he kicked Dean hard in the stomach, causing him to double over in pain and let out a piercing scream.

William said coldly, "You don't deserve to know who I am!" Then, turning to his bodyguards, he commanded, "Take them out."

No sooner had he spoken than the bodyguards swiftly surrounded the four men. They swung their fists mercilessly, the sound of punches landing echoing in the room. The crisp sound of bones breaking filled the air, and the men writhed in pain on the floor. Cries and wails filled the room.

"Spare us! We won't do it again!" Clifford cried out in pain. "We really know we were wrong! Someone paid us to do it. Please let us go!"

William ignored the pleas, his eyes locked on the battered and bruised Victoria. The moment Victoria saw William, a flicker of hope lit up her eyes.

She never imagined that in her darkest moment, William would come to her rescue. A surge of relief and joy filled her heart, like finding a lifeline in a storm.

She stared at William, as if he was her only savior. Her lips trembled, as if she wanted to say something, but she was too weak to speak.

William's face was like stone. He unbuttoned his suit jacket, wrapped it around Victoria, and gently picked her up. Victoria winced in pain, her injuries severe, with blood at the corner of her mouth and bruises marring her face.

William didn't spare another glance at the room, quickly carrying Victoria out. The door closed behind them, muffling the men's screams.

In the hallway, William strode forward, his anger barely contained. Victoria closed her eyes and curled up in his arms, her lips trembling. She clung to his shirt, not daring to let go.

William's eyes were dark with fury. He thought, 'No one probably hates Victoria more than I do. But despite everything, I've never really hurt her. How dare those bastards touch her?'

As they neared the elevator, he instinctively pressed Victoria's face against his chest, shielding her from prying eyes. As the elevator descended, he felt a burning wetness on his chest. William frowned, feeling increasingly uneasy.

The car was already waiting at the entrance of the Starry Nights Hotel. When the driver, Harry Brooks, saw them, he quickly opened the back door, ready to help Victoria.

But William didn't let go, bypassing the driver and placing Victoria in the back seat himself. Though his movements were brisk, he still managed to shield her head from hitting the car door.

After a moment's hesitation, he got in as well, pulling Victoria into his arms. At that moment, Victoria was like a fragile kitten, snuggling against him.

William looked down at Victoria and noticed she was trembling slightly. He frowned and asked coldly, "Are you cold?"

When Victoria didn't respond, he looked at her face and realized something was wrong.

Victoria's face was pale, her brows furrowed, her lips trembling. Curled up as if to stifle an inner turmoil, her body quaked violently. Her lips were dry and tinged with purple, and her eyes were squeezed tightly shut.

William panicked, raising his hand to touch her forehead. The burning heat transferred to his palm, and his brows furrowed tightly, his eyes filled with anxiety.

He said, "Victoria? Wake up!"

In a daze, Victoria seemed to hear someone calling her. She opened her eyes and saw William's anxious and worried expression. She forced a weak smile, but the movement caused her facial wounds to hurt, making her gasp in pain.

She responded, "I'm sorry, Mr. Scott. I'm fine. I just need to sleep for a while."

Her eyes were filled with confusion and helplessness, reddened and pitiful. Seeing her like this, William suddenly felt his heart soften.

###chapter 5 You Should Take Care of Bobby

"Get to the hospital quickly," William barked, his voice sharp.

"On it," Harry, the driver, replied without missing a beat, flooring it toward the nearest private hospital.

Half an hour later, they pulled up at the hospital. The top chief physician had already been alerted, and as soon as they hit the entrance, Victoria was whisked into the emergency room.

William stood outside, his usually composed face etched with worry.

"Mr. Scott, don't stress too much. Ms. Carter will be alright," Harry tried to reassure him.

"Who's worried about her?" William snapped, a bit irritated. Realizing how childish he sounded, he quickly added, "I just hope she doesn't hold up work."

Harry nodded quickly, but inside, he was rolling his eyes. William was clearly worried but just wouldn't admit it. Such a tsundere.

In a VIP hospital room, Victoria lay on the bed, looking pale and weak.

Victoria's eyes fluttered open, her consciousness still hazy. But the moment her gaze fell on anxious, caring Nora by the bedside, her heart skipped a beat. It was the scene she had imagined so many times before.

For a moment, Victoria even wondered if this was a beautiful hallucination brought on by the brink of death.

Nora's eyes were slightly red-rimmed, and she gently took Victoria's hand in hers. Carrying a hint of genuine relief and lingering fear, she said, "Victoria, you're finally awake. I was so scared last night. I felt like I'd lost a part of myself. I just hope you'll be okay." 

Then she leaned closer to Victoria, touching foreheads, as if to check if Victoria still had a fever.

Victoria shook her head slightly, staring at Nora without blinking.

"You silly girl, how did you end up like this?" Nora frowned slightly and continued, "You have no idea how worried I was. From the moment I heard you were in trouble, I couldn't rest. I prayed all night for your safety."

Her voice trembled, clearly scared. Victoria's tears started flowing, each one soaking into the pillow.

"Why are you crying? Are you in pain? If it hurts, tell me, and I'll call the doctor." Nora scanned Victoria's body, worried she might be uncomfortable. She gently pulled up Victoria's blanket, covering her with tender care.

A warm feeling surged in Victoria's heart; she had never felt such genuine concern from Nora. She choked back tears and tried to control her emotions. She said, "Mom, don't worry; I'm fine."

At that moment, she seemed to forget all her pain and grievances, feeling only warmth.

However, this feeling didn't last long. Nora hesitated for a moment, then changed the subject. "Victoria, Bobby's training camp is really important. Could you..."

Victoria's face instantly turned stiff and grim. She realized that Nora's concern was all a facade, just an attempt to ask for money. Her throat tightened, as she felt like a thorn was stuck, making it hard to speak.

She bit down hard to stop her tears from falling, her voice trembling, "Mom, why have you always favored Bobby? Even now, you still think of him first. Aren't I your child, too?"

Her voice trembled, tears welling up in her eyes.

Her thoughts instantly returned to the past, scenes of being ignored and treated differently by Nora playing like a movie in her mind.

"When Bobby was sick, you dropped everything to stay by his side day and night, applying ointment and feeding him, your face filled with tender affection. But when I had a high fever, I lay alone in my room, calling out for you but getting no response. In the end, it was the nanny who couldn't bear to see me like that. She brought me a glass of water and some medicine." Victoria's eyes were filled with pain. 

"At the school's parent-child event, all the other kids were with their moms, but I could only watch enviously. You said you had to take Booby to his painting class, and I didn't even have the courage to ask you to stay with me... For Bobby's birthday, there's always a party, with gifts and trips, but what about mine? Do you even remember my birthday?"

She continued, "When Bobby drew a decent picture, you couldn't wait to frame it and hang it in the living room, showing off his talent to everyone. But even when I won an award at school and brought my drawing home, you didn't even glance at the gift and just tossed it aside." 

Victoria's voice grew more agitated, "After Dad's accident, I dropped out of college, running around every day for your medical bills and Bobby's tuition and living expenses, exhausted. Yet, all I got in return was even more unfair treatment from you."

At the mention of Alvin, Victoria became increasingly emotional. She clutched her chest, crying out in anguish, "Why? What did I do wrong? All the grievances and hardships I've endured, you never cared. It was always for Bobby, making me sacrifice myself. I'm your daughter too! Why can't you treat me fairly for once?"

Victoria's heart was filled with despair and pain. She looked at Nora, her eyes full of questions and expectations, hoping for a reasonable explanation.

Nora, however, was completely indifferent to her pain and said, "You're the older sister; you should take care of Bobby. Besides, money's easy for you now, so why not help him out?"

Hearing Nora's words, Victoria felt her anger and grievances boil over. She shouted, "I've had enough! I'm not your ATM! I have my own life, my own dreams. Why do you never consider my feelings?"

Victoria and Nora argued fiercely, their words cutting and intense. Victoria's heart was heavy with sorrow and helplessness. She realized that Nora might never change, and all her years of expectations and efforts were in vain.

Meanwhile, William stood at the doorway, his eyebrows slightly furrowed. His deep eyes flickered with surprise for a moment, before a more complex emotion crossed his face. He had heard the argument between Victoria and Nora.

After a bit, William opened the door and walked in. Seeing him, Victoria turned her head away, wiping her tears with her sleeve, not wanting him to see her in such a miserable and painful state.

William looked at her sad face and felt his heart stir slightly. He didn't say anything, just standing there silently, and the room fell into an awkward silence.

In the end, it was Nora who couldn't stand it, glaring at Victoria hatefully before turning back to her room. Before leaving, she even took the apple she had peeled for Victoria, intending to give it to Bobby later.

The hospital room was now empty, except for the two of them.

###chapter 6 Let Go of Me!

Victoria lay on the hospital bed, looking as pale as a ghost. She wiped away her tears and glanced up at William.

"How are those people?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Caught off guard, William paused for a moment before saying, "Don't worry. I messed them up pretty bad to get back at them for you."

Victoria's eyes widened in surprise, but then she felt a wave of gratitude. She knew William did it for her, and she felt a rush of appreciation for his protection.

"Did you hand them over to the police?" Victoria asked again.

William hesitated. He tried to change the subject. "How are you feeling now? Does the wound still hurt?" he asked.

Victoria sensed something was off, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. "You didn't hand them over to the police? Do you know who sent them?" she pressed.

William stayed silent, unsure of what to say. He did know who was behind it, but he didn't want Victoria to find out.

"Answer me!" Victoria's voice grew louder, her emotions getting the best of her. "Are you trying to protect the person who did this?"

William's silence only confirmed her suspicions. "Tell me who it is! I'll handle it myself!" she demanded.

William frowned and snapped, "Enough already! You weren't that badly hurt. Just let it go."

Victoria stared at him in disbelief. "Let it go? I almost..."

Her eyes filled with tears, and she trembled as if reliving the trauma. "I almost jumped from the twenty-something floor, and you want me to let it go? Why?"

William's heart skipped a beat, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. But then he got angry. His face darkened, and he sneered, "Who do you think you are? You're just a whore who'd do anything for money! Acting all high and mighty?"

His words cut through Victoria like a knife. Her face went even paler, her eyes wide with shock and pain. She couldn't believe William would say something like that. But then those awful memories came flooding back.

Yes, she had sold herself to William for money. It was out of necessity, but it was still true. She felt exposed, like everyone could see her shame.

"You'd do anything for money. Who knows if you were out hooking yesterday?" William's words grew nastier, a cruel smile on his lips. "So dirty."

His words felt like a slap, making Victoria's face burn as if it had been slashed open.

Without thinking, Victoria slapped him, catching William off guard. "Your words are outrageous!" she cried, her voice shaking with despair, her face even paler. William's face darkened, his eyes burning with anger and disgust.

Victoria, Alvin's daughter, the one who caused so much pain, dared to slap William? In a flash, William's hatred for Victoria surged like a tidal wave.

"Victoria, you're getting way out of line!" William snarled through clenched teeth. He grabbed her wrist and flipped her over, pinning her down on the bed. His bloodshot eyes bore into hers, radiating aggression.

"William, let go of me!" Victoria screamed in pain.

But William seemed deaf to her cries. His eyes were filled with a dark desire and impulse. His anger had taken over, and now he just wanted to vent.

William's hands started roaming over Victoria's body, roughly caressing her slender figure. Victoria endured the intense pain, struggling and resisting. But against an enraged and irrational William, she felt powerless.

She felt his hands moving over her, each touch sending a shiver through her, a mix of pain and an unbearable sensation.

She cried and begged, "No, please let me go!"

Her pleas only seemed to excite William more. He roughly tore off her hospital gown, exposing her breasts. He leaned down, kissing her shoulders, gently nibbling on her delicate skin.

The tingling sensation seeped into Victoria's bones, making her shiver involuntarily. Her body trembled more visibly, and the places where William kissed and nibbled also shook.

She tried to turn her neck to avoid his kisses, but William didn't give her a chance to escape. He grabbed her jaw, forcing her mouth open, and his tongue slipped inside.

A painful moan escaped from Victoria's throat. She felt a surge of heat, making her feel ashamed and unable to control it.

William took advantage, moving forward with his assault. He greedily sucked on her, like a child savoring a treat. Victoria struggled desperately, her legs kicking at his chest, trying to break free.

But the more she resisted, the angrier William got. He flipped her over and straddled her again. His large hand reached between her legs, grasping her labia, and slowly rubbed it.

Victoria keenly felt his touch, unable to help but moan.

"Why are you so sensitive?" William's teasing voice echoed through the room. He smiled wickedly and continued, "You're really lewd."

His fingers slowly moved down along her labia, gently teasing and playing with the area between the labia.

Victoria involuntarily contracted her body, a flush appearing on her pale face. She tightly clamped her legs around his waist, trying to prevent him from invading her most private area.

"William, stop!" Victoria suddenly screamed, her legs loosening.

Between her legs, a hard penis suddenly appeared, pressing against her tender and warm vagina.

Victoria's face instantly flushed red. She bit her lip, forcibly suppressing the feeling of humiliation, trying to ignore the hard penis.

But William had no intention of giving up the pleasure of teasing her. He continued to rub, occasionally thrusting.

###chapter 7 Back to Work

Victoria felt waves of pleasure radiating from her core, making her moan uncontrollably. Hearing her, William got even more excited, thrusting into her warm, soft body and moving in a steady rhythm.

Victoria's body tensed up, sweat forming on her forehead, and she was in such intense pain that she almost fainted, biting her lip to keep from making a sound.

Her face turned pale, and sweat dripped down her temples, soaking the pillow. She felt like her body was being crushed, like she was in a burning furnace. The agony was so intense she nearly convulsed, like a flower about to wither, left to be ravaged.

William kept moving, his thrusts making it hard for Victoria to breathe. Her mind went blank. Finally, William released himself, ejaculating before slowly pulling out and lying beside her, panting.

"Did you enjoy it?" William asked with a cold smile.

Victoria's face was as pale as paper, her eyes unfocused. She didn't deny it because she didn't have the strength.

"Slut! You're just like Avlin-really disgusting!" William spat out fiercely.

Victoria felt like a bolt of lightning had struck her out of nowhere. Her entire being felt shattered. She went from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows in an instant, crashing straight into the depths of despair.

She stared in disbelief at the man who had just been inside her. How could he humiliate her like this? He even insulted her most beloved father!

She felt so dirty, so low. In extreme pain and self-denial, Victoria felt a sharp pain in her chest, as if a fire was burning. Her body swayed, and her vision began to blur. She wanted to say something, but no sound came out.

Blood, thick and salty, flooded her throat. She felt like she was burning from the inside out, her body shaking uncontrollably.

Victoria coughed violently, blood pouring from her mouth and nose. It splattered on the white sheets, staining them with dark red blotches. Her vision blurred, and William's face swam out of focus. She collapsed backward, hitting the bed with a thud, and everything went black

William, who had been lost in his twisted high, was suddenly struck by the sight. His mind went blank, his heart seized up, and a wave of fear he'd never felt before washed over him.

He looked at Victoria lying naked on the blood-stained sheets, her eyes closed and her face as pale as paper. She appeared lifeless, like a broken doll.

He quickly reached out, gently touching Victoria's cheek. Her skin was so cold that his heart sank. He shouted, "Victoria! Wake up!"

His mind was in chaos, thoughts intertwining, his eyes filled with confusion as he looked at Victoria, unconscious on the bed. Hatred and disgust still surged within him, but there was also an inexplicable trace of worry. He didn't understand why he felt this way. He should hate her and want her to suffer as he had. But seeing Victoria in such a fragile state, fainting from his humiliation, he felt a twinge of guilt.

After quickly dressing himself and Victoria, he pressed the call button. The doctor arrived quickly.

Smelling the scent in the room, the doctor felt a moment of awkwardness. But he quickly composed himself, walked to Victoria, and checked her condition.

"How is she?" William asked urgently.

After a thorough examination, the doctor became very serious, advising earnestly, "Sir, please be more restrained. The patient was seriously injured yesterday, and her body has been very weak. She seems to have been suffering from long-term insomnia and hasn't been eating properly. She's very thin, showing signs of anorexia and depression. The recent emotional upset has worsened her condition. She needs to rest."

Hearing the doctor's words, William frowned.

"Are you sure she has anorexia and depression?" William questioned, "She always seemed so strong."

"These are just some early symptoms. Sir, please take good care of the patient's emotions," the doctor replied, then began emergency treatment for Victoria.

William stood by the bed, staring at Victoria's pale face, feeling a whirlwind of emotions. After a moment, he called Harry. "Get a caregiver for her," he said quietly, then left the hospital.

He wasn't sure why he was doing this-maybe a bit of guilt, or maybe he didn't want her to die just yet. She still had "debts" to repay.

Harry looked at Victoria's frail state on the bed, feeling a pang of sympathy. Her face was ghostly pale, tubes sticking out of her, making her look incredibly fragile and helpless. But Harry was just an employee and couldn't go against William's orders.

He quickly found an experienced caregiver and instructed, "Take good care of her and report any changes to me."

The caregiver nodded, promising to look after Victoria.

Victoria lay in the hospital, drifting in and out of consciousness for two days. During this time, Nora came to see her. She glanced at Victoria's pale face, saw she wasn't awake, and frowned. "Ugh, when is she gonna wake up already? We're waiting on her cash." 

Nora didn't even think about getting closer to the hospital bed. Instead, she crossed her arms, walked around the room, and looked at everything with cold eyes, like she was just examining some insignificant object. After a few minutes, she got bored, pulled out her phone, and then left with a huff.

Victoria spent two days unconscious in the hospital. As soon as she came to, William ordered her back to the company, saying there was an important event she had to attend. 

The Scott Group had been working on this project for a long time and finally managed to get the two key executives to attend the dinner.

If they could secure this deal, the Scott Group's influence would rise significantly. So William couldn't afford any mistakes at this dinner.

Since he had worked on this project with Victoria from the beginning, she had to attend the dinner. When Victoria received the notice, she felt a sense of helplessness and bitterness.

Her body was still very weak, with every movement feeling like knives cutting into her, but she knew she had no right to refuse.

When Victoria arrived at the Scott Group, William happened to be coming down the stairs.

Today, he was dressed in a dark custom suit, with a neat tie and a gemstone pin that gleamed coldly. His shoes were polished, and he stood tall and imposing, exuding a cold and noble aura.

His chiseled features bore a distant expression, and his stoic demeanor created an invisible barrier that made him difficult to approach.

Victoria hurriedly got out of the taxi, hastily tidying her clothes, and then walked quickly towards William in her high heels. Yet she stopped about three feet away from him.

"Mr. Scott," Victoria said respectfully, bowing her head slightly.

William glanced at the limited-edition Rolex on his wrist. The dial was a deep, dark blue. He then gave Victoria a cold, indifferent look, his eyes devoid of any warmth. Without a word, he walked straight toward his black Maybach.

Victoria quickly walked a few steps ahead to open the car door for William. After he got in, she gently closed the door and then got into the passenger seat.

Today's crucial business meeting was arranged at the city's top five-star hotel.

William valued this project highly and had been personally involved from the start. The other party seemed to sense William's seriousness and had been trying to get the best deal.

When they met in the reserved private room, they first exchanged handshakes and pleasantries.

Kirk Gutierrez, one of them, said, "Hello, Mr. Scott. I've heard so much about you. It's great to meet you in person finally. You truly live up to your reputation."

William and Victoria were young and imposing, while the other party consisted of a group of shrewd men in their forties. They shook hands with William first, then turned their attention to Victoria.

"And this is..." asked the other man, Rufus Chapman.

Victoria got up slowly. Her tailored suit hugged her slender, curvy figure. Her small, delicate face was perfectly made up. But even with all the makeup, you could still see how tired and worn-out she was.

She smiled and introduced herself, "Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman. I'm Mr. Scott's assistant, Victoria."

After they sat down, William got straight to the point, discussing the project.

However, the other party was cunning. Kirk waved his hand, his eyes fixed on the beautiful Victoria, and said, "With such a beauty here, why talk about work? Let's eat first."

###chapter 8 Business Negotiation

The other party was clearly trying to brush off William. If they really didn't want to talk business today, they wouldn't have shown up with such a big entourage.

Victoria sat next to William, eyeing the glass of water she had just poured. The waiter had brought in a jug of water earlier. She'd been injured recently and was still pretty weak. The doctor had told her to avoid alcohol and cold drinks. But today...

Victoria gently picked up the glass, filled it with red wine, and stood up, a perfect smile on her face. "I'm sure everyone knows how strong the Scott Group is. Trust us, we won't let you down," she said.

In a room full of men, a woman's words carried a lot of weight. Sure enough, Rufus and Kirk stopped using the "no work talk during meals" excuse.

Rufus, with his big belly, stared at the elegant Victoria, grinning. He said, "Mr. Gutierrez and I have checked out your company's credentials. We've also heard that Ms. Carter is quite the drinker. It just so happens that we can hold our liquor too. How about a drinking contest?"

Victoria had just been through a lot, her body hadn't fully recovered, and her wounds still ached. She quietly placed one hand near her wound, her delicate makeup making her look quite well, not too haggard.

But Rufus didn't give Victoria a chance to refuse, directly asking the waiter to bring the wine. Soon, the waiter brought an ice bucket with several bottles of wine inside, mixed with ice cubes.

"This wine is best enjoyed cold!" Kirk cheerfully took a chilled bottle from the ice bucket, opened the cap, and first poured wine for Victoria.

The wine glass was filled to the brim, then he poured for himself and Rufus, and raised his glass.

He continued, "Ms. Carter, you must show us some respect."

Victoria looked down at the full glass of wine, her fingertips lightly touching the rim. The cold feeling made her shiver.

William leaned slightly against the back of the chair, one hand casually placed on the table, fingers lightly tapping the surface. While others were clueless about his emotions, Victoria, who knew him well, could tell he was losing his patience.

Victoria's heart tightened a bit. She lifted her head slightly and smiled, "We are gathered here today for better cooperation opportunities. The Scott Group has always been based on integrity and has strong capabilities. I believe in our future cooperation, and we will bring you substantial returns. Let me drink this glass of wine first as a toast to our upcoming cooperation."

After speaking, she raised her glass and drank it all in one go. 

The cold liquor felt like a knife slicing down her throat, and a sharp pain surged through her. She almost lost her balance but clenched her teeth to keep from showing any weakness. Her usually delicate face turned slightly pale.

Sensing Victoria's sincere attitude, Kirk and Rufus also drank a glass. With the drinks down, it was time to start discussing the cooperation.

Victoria put down her glass and got to the point. She said, "Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman, since you are willing to meet us, it shows that you recognize our capabilities. We also cherish the opportunity to cooperate with your company. Since both sides have the intention to cooperate, why hesitate? Early cooperation is beneficial for both of us, isn't it?"

Kirk frowned a bit and said, "Ms. Carter, you're right. We know the Scott Group is strong. But the market's tough right now, and we have to think about our company's interests. We've also looked into another company. They not only promised a 10% discount but also offered extra technical support and professional training, which is really appealing to us."

Victoria smiled slightly and said, "I get your concerns. But the Scott Group has the best R&D team in the industry, can provide personalized services for clients, and has a comprehensive after-sales service system. Sure, the other company offers some extras, but can they match us in these areas?"

Rufus nodded and said, "Ms. Carter, you make a good point. But their offer is very tempting."

Victoria calmly replied, "The offer might seem tempting, but it's just short-term benefits. We promise long-term cooperation and mutual benefit. I'm sure you'll make the right choice once you've thought it through."

Hearing this, Kirk and Rufus started to mull it over.

At this moment, William straightened up a bit, his eyes showing unshakable confidence.

He slowly said, "Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman, we will provide your company with comprehensive resource support, including market promotion, talent training, and more. We'll also send a professional team to your company to understand your specific needs and pain points and then create the best development strategy for you. Our goal is to advance together with your company and create a leading enterprise in the industry."

William's words made Kirk and Rufus's eyes light up. They exchanged glances and saw the excitement in each other's eyes.

Victoria immediately understood William's intention. At some point, just one look from him was enough for her to understand his thoughts.

The two glasses of cold wine were already taking their toll; her wound felt like it was being stabbed by thousands of sharp blades, with the pain spreading intensely. Victoria almost couldn't stand, but she managed to avoid an embarrassing fall by gripping the chair firmly as she sat down.

She took a deep breath and stood up again. She first picked up the wine bottle, then took William's wine glass, and poured wine for him.

William took the wine glass from Victoria, stood up, and slightly raised his hand. When he looked at Kirk and Rufus, his face still showed no expression, his voice was not loud, but his words were powerful and convincing.

Victoria also stood up and said, "Mr. Scott rarely makes promises. But now that he's promising to give you full resource support and tailored development strategies, it shows he really values this partnership and has high hopes for it. So, Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman, consider it carefully."

It must be said that William was very good at tempting people.

###chapter 9 Delicious Oatmeal

On one side, there's a 10% discount along with technical support and professional training; on the other side, there's comprehensive resource support and a customized development strategy. Any smart person would go for the latter.

But investing wasn't just about winning or losing.

To make money, it took more than just empty promises; it required real skills and a bit of luck.

Sensing the hesitation, Victoria didn't waste time. She grabbed another bottle of wine from the ice bucket and popped it open.

Holding the bottle, she looked straight at Kirk and Rufus and said, "We won't let your company down. This is our promise."

Then she took a swig straight from the bottle, the wine level dropping visibly. Victoria's bold move even made the shrewd businessmen Kirk and Rufus feel a bit embarrassed.

They stared for a moment, then burst into cheers, "Great!"

Victoria set down the now-empty bottle.

"Just for Ms. Carter's sincerity, we believe you won't let us down!" That was it-the deal was sealed.

Victoria's lips curled into a slight smile. "Thank you, Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman, for your trust," she said.

"Come on, let's toast to our partnership!" She grabbed her wine glass and clinked glasses with both of them.

One glass after another, the spicy and cold sensation cycled through, numbing Victoria gradually. She couldn't feel the spiciness of the wine, the coldness, or even the pain of her wounds.

After some time, Kirk and Rufus were completely drunk. Their faces were flushed, eyes glazed, and they staggered as they stood up. Seeing this, Victoria quickly stepped forward to help their assistants support them to the door.

The night breeze blew gently, bringing a slight chill.

Victoria stood by the car, watching as Kirk and Rufus were carefully helped into the car. She bowed slightly and waved goodbye.

The car slowly started, and she stood there, watching it disappear into the night. She let out a sigh of relief; the tough business negotiation had finally reached a successful conclusion.

However, Victoria also felt sharp pain and deep fatigue, and her head was a bit dizzy. Then, she turned and walked towards the car parked not far away. Her steps were unsteady, each one feeling like stepping on cotton.

But she still tried to maintain her composure, not wanting to show her fatigue and discomfort. She opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat, letting out a light sigh as she leaned back, as if shedding a heavy burden.

The car was filled with a faint leather scent, quiet and warm. Victoria closed her eyes, trying to alleviate her fatigue and pain, enduring it silently despite the pain she felt all over.

William had woken up in the back seat at some point, looking at the rearview mirror expressionlessly. He saw Victoria leaning against the window, only seeing one of her shoulders, but his gaze stayed on her the whole way.

The car stopped at the entrance of an old apartment complex. Harry, looking at the sleeping William through the rearview mirror, carefully said to Victoria, "Ms. Carter, we're at your place."

Hearing the voice, Victoria slowly opened her eyes and realized she was home. She frowned slightly and softly said, "Thank you," then grabbed her bag and got out of the car.

The sound of the door closing woke William. His eyes followed the slender figure, watching Victoria stagger into the building. Once she was out of sight, William signaled Harry to drive away.

Dragging her exhausted body, Victoria quickly climbed the stairs to her rented apartment. Her hands trembled as she inserted the key into the lock, gently turning it. With a click, the door slowly opened.

Darkness rushed in like a tide, enveloping her tightly. The living room was pitch black, eerily silent, like a forgotten island, dead and oppressive.

Victoria stood quietly at the door for a long time, not moving to turn on the light. It seemed only in this darkness could she find a moment of peace. Sighing, she reached out and pressed the switch on the wall, and the living room instantly lit up.

Victoria suddenly felt chest tightness and shortness of breath, her throat unbearably dry. She slowly moved to the sofa, wanting to sit down and rest. Suddenly, a wave of nausea hit her, and she stumbled to the bathroom, collapsing by the toilet and vomiting painfully.

The vomit spewed from her mouth, the intense discomfort making her body tremble uncontrollably. Each bout of vomiting felt like an invisible hand was violently pulling at her insides, the pain washing over her like a tide. Her forehead was covered in fine sweat, her face pale as paper.

After vomiting, Victoria leaned weakly against the toilet, tears silently falling. At this moment, she was like a lone boat lost in the vast sea. After a long time, she slowly stood up and opened the fridge, hoping to find something to ease her stomach discomfort.

However, the fridge was empty, with only a few expired drinks and some withered vegetables. Victoria sighed frustratedly, closed the fridge, and prepared to lie down on the bed for a while.

Just then, there was a light knock on the door.

Victoria hesitated, a hint of curiosity rising within her. Who could it be at this late hour?

She opened the door to find her landlord, Elara West, standing there with a bowl of steaming oatmeal. Elara's face was gentle, her eyes full of kindness.

Seeing Victoria's pale face, Elara said with concern, "Victoria, I saw you came back so late and thought you probably hadn't eaten yet. I just made some oatmeal, so I brought you a bowl. Eat it while it's hot to warm yourself up."

Looking at Elara, Victoria felt a surge of indescribable emotion. Her eyes instantly welled up, and she said with a choked voice, "Elara, thank you. You're always so caring."

Elara gently patted Victoria's shoulder and responded, "Silly child, don't mention it. It isn't easy for a young woman to make it on her own; you need to take good care of yourself. If you have any difficulties, just let me know. Don't shoulder it alone. I won't disturb your rest."

With that, she turned and went back upstairs.

Victoria took the oatmeal, closed the door, and returned to her room. She sat at the table, looking at the steaming oatmeal, tears streaming down her face uncontrollably. She covered her mouth, letting the tears flow, crying silently. After a long time, she calmed down and slowly ate the oatmeal.

The next day, Victoria, despite her discomfort, went to the Scott Group. However, when she walked into the office, she found Ella there too.

Ella was dressed in an expensive dress, her makeup exquisite, her eyes full of undisguised arrogance and provocation.

As William's fiancée, she had always been domineering in the Scott Group. As soon as Victoria walked in, a hint of malice flashed in Ella's eyes.

###chapter 10 Really Good at Seducing

When Victoria walked in, the whole office got tense, like even the sunlight dimmed a bit.

William was rocking a sharp dark suit, his tall frame looking all kinds of perfect. His face was like it was carved from stone, with those intense eyebrows and eyes that screamed authority. He saw Victoria and frowned a little.

"Well, Victoria, you look like crap. What were you up to last night? Something shady, maybe?" Ella sneered, loud enough for everyone to hear.

She tilted her chin up and gave Victoria a once-over, like she was looking at something gross. The other folks in the office looked awkward, quickly burying their heads in their work, not wanting to get involved.

Some whispered among themselves, grumbling about Ella, but no one dared to stand up for Victoria. After all, Ella was William's fiancée, and no one wanted to risk their job. The air in the office felt like it was freezing, making everyone uncomfortable.

Victoria frowned but tried to ignore Ella's nonsense.

But Ella wasn't done. "What? You think you're special? You're just using your looks to get ahead."

Her words were like daggers, each one aimed at Victoria.

Ella strutted over, lifted Victoria's chin with a painted nail, and sneered, "Look at you. Do you really think you can climb the ladder?"

Victoria was used to Ella's jabs and stayed calm. She took a deep breath and said, "Ms. Garcia, I'm just doing my job."

"Yeah, right. Everyone knows you're trying to impress William," Ella scoffed, crossing her arms. "Now, go sort all the project files for this quarter. Reclassify them like I said, and I want them on my desk by the end of the day. Screw it up, and you're in big trouble."

She dumped a huge stack of files on the floor, way more than one person could handle in a day.

Victoria didn't flinch, just starting picking them up, ready to get to work. But she was feeling worse, dizzy and barely able to stand. Still, she straightened up, not showing any weakness.

The office was so quiet that only the sound of pages turning and Victoria's somewhat heavy breathing could be heard.

Ella yelled, "Hurry up. If you mess up William's work, you're done." Her voice was like nails on a chalkboard, making everyone wince.

Ella watched Victoria, feeling smug. She was here to see if Victoria knew she was behind that incident. If Victoria knew, she'd have to shut her up for good.

Ella thought, 'That idiot has no clue. William still cares about me.'

After a while, Victoria felt so bad she went to the restroom. In a stall, she heard some colleagues talking.

"Victoria, isn't she just a high school grad? Everyone here has a master's or Ph.D., even the receptionist went to a top school, but Victoria acts like she's somebody," a sharp voice said.

Another woman chimed in, "Totally. I heard she's just a nobody who sleeps her way up. Look at her, she must've done something shady to get her job."

"Yeah, she must be sleeping with Mr. Scott. Why else would he make her his secretary? She's probably easy, anyone could have her," a rough voice added nastily.

The first woman spoke again, "She deserves everything Ella throws at her. Trying to seduce someone's fiancé? She should be shamed."

Victoria listened to their cruel words with a blank face, her fists clenched so tight her nails dug into her palms, but she didn't feel the pain.

She couldn't wrap her head around how these women, her peers, could be so vicious. She fought to keep her emotions in check, reminding herself not to let their words get to her. They didn't know her, and their opinions didn't matter.

Once they left, Victoria stepped out of the stall and fixed herself up at the sink. But then, a wave of nausea hit her, and she covered her mouth, trying hard not to throw up.

The discomfort made her face even paler, sweat dotting her forehead. She leaned on the sink, taking a moment to stop the retching.

She slowly lifted her head, looking at her pale, hollow-eyed reflection in the mirror, feeling a wave of disgust.

She wiped the mirror clean with a tissue, then took out her makeup bag to touch up her face, trying to look a bit better. She reminded herself she couldn't give up. Alvin was still waiting for her to save him. Nora and Bobby might not like her, but she had to support Bobby through college and help cure Nora's illness.

As for herself? Victoria smiled bitterly, it didn't matter.

After fixing herself up, Victoria walked out of the restroom and got back to the tasks Ella had given her. But no matter what she did, Ella always found something to criticize and kept making things hard for her.

"What kind of organization is this? It's a mess. Do it again and check every file carefully. There can't be any mistakes," Ella said harshly.

Just then, William walked over and glanced at Victoria indifferently, ignoring Ella's harassment.

Seeing Victoria on the verge of collapse, Harry couldn't take it anymore. He went over to support her and asked, "Are you okay?"

Ella immediately mocked, "Wow, you're good at seducing, huh? Even got William's driver in such a short time."

William heard this and his expression darkened. He gave Victoria a cold look and then told Harry to go run an errand.

Victoria ignored Ella's taunts and focused on her work. Even though Victoria didn't finish college, she had always been a top student. She majored in art, but her grades were on par with the best students.

Even after dropping out, she kept taking college courses whenever she could, in accounting, management andanything that could help her at work. That's why she became William's secretary so quickly, not because she was his lover or got special treatment.

So in just one morning, she organized the materials perfectly, leaving Ella, who was trying to make things hard for her, with nothing to criticize.

But Ella wasn't about to give up. After lunch, she started nitpicking again.

Ella said, "Go make me a cup of hand-brewed coffee and get my afternoon tea ready."

Victoria did as she was told, trying her best to get every detail right, hoping to satisfy Ella. But Ella was never going to be satisfied.

###chapter 11 Reflecting in the Rain

Ella sneered, "What kind of coffee is this? It's terrible. And the dessert is disgusting. Even a dog wouldn't touch this."

Her eyes landed on a picture of Victoria and Alvin on Victoria's desk.

A wicked grin spread across her face as she picked up the photo and said with disdain, "Victoria, look at your dad. He claims to be the country's top architect? The stadium he built collapsed-luckily, no one died, but the resort hotel he designed ten years ago collapsed and killed dozens. He's a murderer! He only got ten years in prison, but he should've gotten the death penalty-poisoned, electrocuted, shot!"

Victoria's eyes flared with anger at Ella's cruel words. She rushed over, snatched the photo, and clutched it to her chest.

Glaring at Ella, she shouted, "Shut up! My dad has paid a heavy price for his mistakes. He was sentenced to ten years by the law, and he tried his best to compensate the victims' families. He's trying to make amends for his wrongs. And what about you? Besides throwing your weight around because of your family's background, what meaningful things have you done? Do you think that makes you important? No, you're just a pathetic person with an ugly heart and an empty soul. You have no right to judge my father or his life."

Ella was so enraged by Victoria's words that she saw red and snatched the photo frame from Victoria's hands, smashing it to the ground and stomping on it with her high heels.

Victoria's anger hit its peak as she watched Ella's actions. Unable to take it any longer, she grabbed a pastry and shoved it into Ella's mouth, shouting, "Your mouth is so foul. This pastry will clean it."

Ella was stunned by the sudden action and was about to retaliate when William, already furious, walked over. He picked up a large glass of water from the table and threw it in Victoria's face. Water splashed all over Victoria's face and body, leaving her in a sorry state.

Then, William slapped Victoria hard across the face, shouting angrily, "Victoria, who do you think you are? How dare you disrespect my fiancée. What's wrong with what she said? Doesn't a murderer deserve to die?"

Victoria was stunned by the water and the slap, her head buzzing. For a moment, time seemed to stand still, and everything around her became blurry.

Tears glistened in her once bright eyes, but she held them back. She raised her head slightly and looked directly at William.

"I won't let you insult my father! He's the best architect in my heart," she said, her voice hoarse and trembling but full of strength. "He's designed so many buildings without any issues. I believe there must be other reasons."

"The court found him fully responsible, and you still want to clear his name? Dream on!" William's voice was cold, devoid of any warmth, and his gaze at Victoria was full of warning.

Victoria's body trembled slightly, and she bit her lip until it bled. Her hands clenched into fists, nails digging into her palms, but she felt no pain. She wanted to argue but couldn't find a reason.

Ella, seeing Victoria's sorry state, felt extremely pleased. The feeling of having Victoria under her heel made her both excited and triumphant. 

She said, "Victoria, you're just the daughter of a murderer. What if you were almost raped? No one will stand up for you! I don't mind telling you, those four men who tried to rape you only suffered minor injuries. They're fine now, living a wealthy life, enjoying themselves!"Ella's words dripped with mockery and pride.

It wasn't until she finished speaking that she realized she might've slipped up. Her words seemed to confirm to Victoria that she had a hand in that incident. She quickly glanced at William, and seeing no reaction from him, she breathed a sigh of relief.

Victoria felt like she'd been struck by lightning hearing Ella's words. Her eyes widened in shock and disbelief. Trembling, she murmured, "How is that possible? How could they have only minor injuries?"

Her mind was flooded with the pain and humiliation she had suffered, while those who hurt her walked away unscathed. It felt like an invisible hand was squeezing her heart, making it hard to breathe.

"William, didn't you say they had been punished? You're a liar!" Victoria angrily questioned William.

William frowned, his expression darkening. "Victoria, calm down and know your place," he said.

"I can't calm down! Didn't you tell me they had been arrested?" Victoria continued to question, her voice trembling with anger. Her voice was like a blade, piercing William's heart.

His face darkened further, a flicker of unease in his eyes, but he suppressed it and coldly responded, "Victoria, don't make me lose my patience with you!"

Victoria's heart felt like it was being squeezed, the pain washing over her. Her thoughts raced like a torrent, flooding her with fear and anger.

The shadows of the past surged, and memories of being beaten, humiliated, and her helpless struggles in the dark all resurfaced.

"You're a liar! A shameless liar!" she cried out in anguish, her voice hoarse, suffocating in her inability to breathe.

William frowned slightly, a complex emotion crossing his face.

"Victoria!" he finally spoke, his voice low but commanding, "You're just someone who sell your body. You have no right to shout at me! If you can't calm down, go reflect downstairs, or I guarantee you'll regret your impulsiveness today!"

By now, it was pouring rain outside, the large raindrops hitting the glass windows with a crisp sound.

The rain obscured everything as Victoria stared at William blankly. The hatred in her eyes gradually faded, replaced by deep despair and helplessness.

Victoria straightened her back, slowly turned, and walked towards the elevator under William's inscrutable gaze. She stepped out into the rain, which quickly soaked her hair and clothes, the cold water running down her cheeks.

Her already pale face became even more bloodless under the rain, like a sheet of white paper. The five-finger mark on her face was clearly visible. She bit her lip hard, trying to stay conscious of the pain, but her lips were already bloody and raw.

Passersby hurried by, the rain blurring Victoria's vision, but she could still hear their mocking voices.

"Look at that woman, probably a mistress caught by the wife and being punished! Look, she even got slapped!" a middle-aged woman muttered, her eyes full of disdain.

"Maybe she scammed someone and is getting her comeuppance," a young man sneered as he walked past Victoria.

Victoria could only smile bitterly at the mockery.

The rain poured harder, soaking her completely, the cold seeping into her body through every pore. Her teeth chattered uncontrollably, and the pain and exhaustion made it hard for her to stand as she trembled in the rain.

###chapter 12 Like a Drowned Rat

However, after being out in the rain for way too long and dealing with all that physical and mental crap, Victoria finally hit her breaking point. Her vision started getting all fuzzy, and she felt her strength just drain away until she was like a ragdoll.

Eventually, everything went black, and she hit the ground hard, water splashing everywhere. People around her barely even glanced her way and just kept on walking.

Nobody stepped up to help, and it was like no one gave a damn whether she lived or died. The world around her stayed loud and chaotic, while she just lay there quietly in the rain. The rain kept pounding down on her, making her look like some lifeless doll getting battered by the elements.

Right then, Harry came back from running errands. He spotted Victoria lying there in the rain, and his heart just about stopped. He rushed over, squatted down, and gently called her name.

But Victoria didn't respond; she was already out cold. Without thinking twice, Harry took off his coat and covered her with it. He glanced up at the tall figure in the big floor-to-ceiling window on the twentieth floor and sighed. Then he carefully picked her up, put her in the back seat, and sped off to the hospital.

In the VIP ward, Victoria's face was flushed, her breathing was fast, and she had a raging fever. Her brows were all scrunched up, like she was stuck in some awful nightmare.

In her dream, she was back in that horrible moment when Alvin was taken away. She wanted to save him, but she was helpless.

Then, she saw the four guys who had tried to rape her, their faces smug and mocking her weakness. She wanted to run, but her feet felt like they were made of lead. She screamed in despair, but no one came to help.

Next, the scene shifted, and she saw William's cold face and the hand that slapped her hard. Her heart felt like it was being ripped apart, the pain unbearable.

Victoria kept struggling in her dream, her body trembling slightly, and sweat beads forming on her forehead.

In the ward, the faint sounds of medical equipment echoed, and no one knew the hell she was going through in her dream, nor could anyone pull her out of it.

Harry stayed outside the ward for a bit, watching Victoria's pained expression, feeling a deep sense of pity. He knew he couldn't stay there forever; he had stuff to report to William.

Taking a deep breath, Harry pulled himself together, and left the hospital. When he got to William's office, he knocked lightly on the door.

Hearing William's low "come in," he slowly pushed the door open.

The office reeked of tobacco, making Harry cough. William was sitting at his desk, coldly staring at some documents. His brows were slightly furrowed, his gaze focused and icy.

Harry hesitated for a moment but then spoke up, "Mr. Scott, Ms. Carter fainted outside the company. I took her to the hospital."

William slightly raised his head, a flicker of some complex emotion in his eyes, but it quickly turned back to indifference.

His gaze landed on Harry, as if he was waiting for more info. "How is she?" he asked. His voice was flat, showing no concern at all.

Harry replied, "The doctor said she's got a fever, and her condition's pretty unstable. She's having some kind of nightmare, and looks really distressed."

William was quiet for a moment, then coldly said, "She brought it on herself. She's just a nobody; her life or death means nothing to me."

After saying that, he went back to his documents, like Victoria's situation didn't matter at all.

Harry looked at William's indifferent expression, feeling a bit helpless. He knew the beef between William and Victoria ran deep, but he also thought William was being a bit too harsh.

His lips moved, like he wanted to say something, but he didn't know where to start. In the end, he just left the office silently.

As he walked out, he sighed lightly. He could only hope William wouldn't regret treating Victoria this way someday.

After who knew how long, Victoria slowly woke up from her stupor. She opened her heavy eyes, and the first thing she saw was the white ceiling and familiar medical equipment.

Her head was foggy, and her body felt weak and powerless. She tried to remember what had happened, and a wave of bitterness rose in her heart.

Just then, the door to the ward was suddenly pushed open, and Ella walked in, all high and mighty.

She was dressed in fancy clothes, her face full of arrogance. She got straight to the point, pulling out a settlement agreement and tossing it onto Victoria's bed.

"Victoria, if you know what's good for you, sign this agreement and drop the whole thing." Ella's voice was sharp and cold.

Victoria looked at the agreement, and her anger flared up. Dragging her sick body, she struggled to sit up and glared at Ella.

"Ella, do you think I'll let you off that easy? I'll never forget what you did to me." Victoria's voice was weak but filled with determination.

Ella sneered, her eyes full of contempt. "You'd better know your place. Do you really think you can go up against me? You're nothing but a pathetic insect. Look at you now-you're like a drowned rat," she said mockingly, raising her chin slightly as if looking at a lowly creature.

Victoria's face turned pale, her body trembling slightly. "Ella, don't push it!" she said.

Ella, however, was unfazed and kept mocking. "Push it? What can you do to me? Your dad's a criminal, and you're no better. What right do you have to challenge me? Do you think William cares about your life or death? Stop dreaming. He only keeps you around to amuse himself when he's bored. You pathetic wretch; you only caught William's eye because you look like my sister who's abroad. You're just his plaything. You really think you're something?" she said.

Hearing this, Victoria bit her lip tightly, using all her strength to point to the door. "Get out! I don't want to see you again. I'm not signing your damn agreement, so give up!"

Ella's face turned livid with anger, but she had no choice but to leave the ward. As she walked out, she ran into Bobby, who had come to ask Victoria for money.

Bobby overheard their conversation, and his eyes lit up. He immediately blocked Ella's path, a greedy expression on his face.

###chapter 13 I Won't Let It Go

"Are you Ella? If you hand me a million bucks, I'll get Victoria to sign the settlement," Bobby said, his voice dripping with greed like he already had the cash in his pocket.

Ella shot him a look of pure disgust. "You? You're as low as Victoria. Do you even know your own worth? How dare you ask for a million dollars?"

But Bobby wasn't backing down. "Don't underestimate me. Give me the money, and I promise she'll sign."

His eyes gleamed with confidence, like he had Victoria wrapped around his finger.

Ella hesitated. She couldn't stand Bobby, but she wanted to get this mess with Victoria over with. "Fine. I'll give you two hundred grand upfront. Once Victoria signs, you'll get the rest."

Bobby's face lit up. "Deal. You better not back out."

A smug grin spread across his face, as if he was already picturing himself living it up with the money.

Ella pulled a check from her bag and tossed it to him. "Take it and get to work. Screw this up, and you'll regret it."

Bobby grabbed the check, still grinning. He watched Ella walk away, already plotting how to get Victoria to sign. Bobby strolled into the hospital room, seeing Victoria lying weakly on the bed. He didn't show a hint of concern.

He tossed the settlement agreement in front of her. "Victoria, sign this now," he demanded, his voice cold and selfish.

Victoria looked at the agreement, then at Bobby, her eyes filled with disappointment. "Bobby, I'm not signing this. Forget it."

Bobby's face twisted with anger. "Why are you so stubborn? If you don't sign, how am I supposed to get the rest of the money? I need it for a training camp. Can't you help me out?"

His voice was sharp, and he completely ignored Victoria's condition.

Victoria sighed. "Bobby, it's not that I don't want to help, but what she did was awful. I can't just let it go."

But Bobby wasn't listening. He always thought, thanks to Nora's favoritism, that Victoria should do everything for him.

"You're useless. You can't even handle this. Do you know how much effort I've put into this training camp? Can't you think about me for once?" he snapped, full of blame.

Victoria's face turned pale with anger. "Bobby, how can you say that? Haven't I done enough for you? Do you have to drain me dry to be satisfied?"

Bobby ignored her and kept insulting her. "You're just a loser. You can't even get the money for my training camp. Stop pretending to be noble. Sign the agreement now, or I'll get Mom to deal with you."

Victoria looked at his twisted, ugly sneer, her heart sinking. She never thought someone so close could treat her this way. She closed her eyes, not wanting to see him anymore. But Bobby, seeing Victoria ignoring him, got even more pissed.

He grabbed her arm and shook her hard. "Did you hear me? Sign it now!"

His actions were rough, showing zero compassion. Victoria, dizzy from the shaking, used all her strength to break free. "Bobby, get out! I won't sign this agreement."

Bobby was about to keep at it, but luckily, the doctor and nurse rushed in after hearing the commotion.

Bobby shot Victoria a nasty glare and stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

The doctor looked at Victoria, all disheveled and worn out, and sighed. "Ms. Carter, things will get better."

Victoria forced a bitter smile and thanked him for his kindness.

William, being generous for once, gave Victoria five days of sick leave, telling her to rest up and not look so sickly, as it would affect the Scott Group's image.

The VIP hospital room was top-notch, spacious, and bright.

Victoria sat on the wicker chair on the balcony, staring blankly at the beautiful scenery outside. It was late autumn, and the trees and flowers had withered, but the mountain behind the hospital was still lush and vibrant.

This was the life of the wealthy, while Victoria felt like just an ordinary person who had taken a wrong turn.

Victoria stayed in the hospital for two days, during which Nora came up from the regular ward downstairs several times.

Facing Victoria's uncooperative attitude, Nora was anxious and impatient. "Victoria, sign that agreement quickly! Bobby's future depends on this. You can't be so selfish and only think about yourself. Bobby is the hope of our family. Can't you sacrifice a little for him? If you don't sign, you'll ruin Bobby and our family's future."

Before Victoria could respond, Bobby also rushed into the room, shouting angrily. "Victoria, how can you be so ungrateful? If you don't sign the agreement, what will I do? If I can't go to the training camp, my future will be ruined. You just can't stand to see me doing well. You've never cared about me. If you have any conscience, sign the agreement now and stop ruining my life."

Seeing Nora's and Bobby's relentless pestering, Victoria was completely disheartened. Unable to bear it any longer, she decided to call the police.

The police quickly arrived at the hospital to file a report. A female officer named Luna Bailey sat by Victoria's bed, carefully asking about the situation.

"Ms. Carter, don't worry. Tell us what happened in detail," Luna's voice was steady and reassuring.

Victoria tried to calm down and began to recount her ordeal. "A few days ago, at the Starry Nights Hotel, I was almost..."

She told the police everything that happened that night in detail.

Luna then sent her colleagues to the Starry Nights Hotel to check the surveillance footage, only to find that all the records from those days were gone. The hotel explained that they had been hit by a virus. Although everyone knew something was fishy, the police couldn't do much about it.

Luna frowned slightly. "Do you have any suspects?" she asked.

Victoria bit her lip and said, "I think it might be Ella."

Why she didn't mention William's name, even Victoria herself might not know.

###chapter 14 Live for Yourself

Luna thought for a second and said, "We don't have any solid proof right now, so we can't jump to conclusions. But don't worry, we'll dig into this and find some leads. Can you tell us anything about the guys who tried to attack you?"

Victoria, who was a natural at drawing, quickly sketched out the faces of the men.

Luna checked out the drawings, clearly impressed. "Ms. Carter, these are super helpful. We'll use them to kick off our investigation and track these guys down ASAP. You just focus on getting better and wait for our updates."

Feeling a bit more at ease, Victoria said, "Officer Bailey, thank you so much."

Luna replied seriously, "We'll do everything we can to investigate. You need to stay safe too. If you notice anything weird, call us right away. We'll keep on this case and make sure you get justice."

"Okay, thank you," Victoria said again.

After the cops left, Victoria didn't want to see Nora and Bobby anymore and left the hospital right away. With her heart pounding, Victoria headed to the prison to visit Alvin.

In the visiting room, she nervously rubbed her hands, waiting for Alvin to show up. When the door on the other side of the glass opened, revealing that familiar figure, tears welled up in her eyes.

Alvin appeared older than she remembered; his hair had turned gray, and his face showed signs of weariness and worry. When he saw Victoria, his eyes lit up. He eagerly picked up the phone and asked, "Victoria, why are you here?"

Trying to hold back her tears, Victoria smiled and said, "Dad, I just missed you and wanted to see you."

Alvin's eyes were full of pain. "Victoria, you have to take good care of yourself since I'm not there with you. Don't let anyone mistreat you, okay?" he said.

Victoria nodded, tears welling up. "Dad, I know. You take care of yourself in there too. I'll try to get the money together to get you out as soon as I can."

Alvin's eyes reddened, and he looked worried. He said, "Victoria, don't worry about me. Just take care of yourself."

Victoria's heart ached seeing Alvin's once-confident and handsome face now pale and thin. After calming down, she decided to ask the question that had been on her mind for a long time. "Dad, can you tell me about the gym collapse and the bridge collapse ten years ago? I really want to know."

Hearing this, Alvin was a bit taken aback, his expression complicated. He said, "Victoria, I was the designer for both projects, and I am confident in them. I have thoroughly reviewed and verified every detail. After the police investigation, they said the materials and construction were fine, but an expert claimed it was a design issue. Since he said so, it must be my lack of skill. You shouldn't dig into it further."

Victoria frowned and said, "Dad, this is too weird."

Alvin sighed, "Victoria, some things aren't as simple as they seem. Both accidents had a lot of factors, not something that can be explained in a few words. Don't get yourself into trouble, just live your life."

Victoria wasn't ready to give up. "Dad, I just feel something's off. I want to know what really happened. Please tell me."

Alvin looked at Victoria seriously and said, "Victoria, listen to me. Don't get involved in this. Your priority now is to take care of yourself and plan for your future. Don't take risks."

Seeing the determination in Alvin's eyes, Victoria knew he wouldn't say more. She nodded reluctantly and said, "Dad, I understand. I'll take good care of myself."

They talked about some everyday stuff, which, although ordinary, felt especially precious at that moment. Time flew by, and the visiting time was almost up.

Alvin looked at Victoria with reluctance and said, "Victoria, take care of yourself and live for yourself. Nora and Bobby..."He suddenly stopped, hesitating whether to continue.

"What about them?" Victoria sensed something was up and asked urgently.

But Alvin shook his head, indicating he had nothing more to say, and waved her off.

Victoria was filled with doubts, feeling there was more to Alvin's words.

As the visiting bell rang, she slowly put down the phone. She watched Alvin being led away by the guards, her heart heavy with sorrow.

Victoria headed to the Scott Group, where the familiar yet oppressive atmosphere felt like a suffocating net. Her mood was heavy and complicated because she had decided to end this chaotic relationship.

Alvin's debt could be repaid slowly, and she would find another way to deal with Nora's illness, but she could no longer force herself to beg William.

William never treated Victoria like a human being.

Alvin was right; Victoria should live for herself.

William walked over with steady steps, his face cold as ice. His gaze swept over Victoria indifferently, as if she were just a speck of dust, insignificant.

He slightly raised his chin and said coldly, "Get ready to go with me to inspect Kirk's company."

Victoria stood there, a complex emotion rising in her heart. She looked at William's cold back, bit her lip, and mustered the courage to say, "Mr. Scott, I have something to say."

Hearing this, William stopped, slightly turned his head, and a trace of impatience flashed in his eyes. "What is it?" he asked.

Victoria took a deep breath and said slowly, "Mr. Scott, I want to resign and terminate our financial support agreement involving a sexual relationship. I'll find a way to repay this month's money."

William felt a surge of anger and glared at Victoria. He said, "Do you think you have the right to say this to me?"

Victoria straightened her back and met William's gaze fearlessly. She responded, "Mr. Scott, I get it-I'm like a little ant to you, one of the rich and powerful. But I have my own dignity and dreams. I don't want to be controlled by you anymore."

William's lips curled into a cruel smile. "What dignity do you have in front of me? You're just my sexual release tool. What about your mother's medical bills? Your brother's tuition? Your father's debt?" he said.

Victoria's heart ached slightly, but she remained firm. "Mr. Scott, whether I take care of them or not is none of your business. I've made up my mind. I'm not here to seek your approval, just to inform you."

William slammed his hand down on the table so hard that the papers scattered everywhere. He glared at her and growled, "Don't you dare!"

Victoria's body trembled slightly, but she stubbornly said, "Mr. Scott, this is a society governed by law."

William was completely enraged by Victoria's defiance. He suddenly rushed forward, grabbing Victoria's arm with such force it felt like he would crush her bones.

He roughly dragged her towards himself. Victoria struggled in terror, but William's strength was overwhelming, and she couldn't break free.

William dragged her into the small compartment in the office and slammed the door shut. He stared at Victoria intensely, stepping closer to her with each powerful, oppressive step.

Victoria kept retreating until her back was against the wall.

Without hesitation, William grabbed Victoria's collar and yanked hard. The buttons of her shirt popped off, revealing her smooth skin, which looked especially vulnerable under the dim light.

Victoria cried out in despair, "William, let me go! This is illegal!"

William seemed to have lost his mind. His fingers lightly traced Victoria's cheek, carrying a burning temperature.

He lowered his head slightly, his breath hot and erratic near Victoria's ear. "Do you think you can just come and go as you please? Do you take me for a merciful person?"

As he spoke, he pressed Victoria onto the desk, kissing her neck and cheeks frantically.

Victoria struggled desperately, trying to break free from his grip, but her strength was insignificant compared to his.

William's hands roamed freely over Victoria's body, tearing at her clothes. The fabric in his hands was as fragile as paper, quickly shredding into pieces. He turned Victoria around, lifted her leg to his waist, and pressed himself tightly against her entrance.

###chapter 15 I Must Leave

Victoria fought like hell, but William's grip was way too strong for her to break free.

Without any foreplay, he thrust into her forcefully, moving recklessly. Victoria's mind went blank from the pain, almost paralyzing her. Her fingertips dug deeply into William's shoulders, tears streaming down her face.

Seeing this, William got even angrier. "Why are you acting all pitiful? Aren't you enjoying this?" His movements got rougher as he spoke.

He gripped her waist tightly with one hand, while the other hand squeezed her buttocks, occasionally slapping them hard.

Victoria groaned in pain but gritted her teeth and took it.

"Victoria, you better behave, and I'll let you go when I'm done!" William threatened, his tone ice-cold.

Victoria bit her lip, holding back any sound, but her eyes were already red and swollen.

Seeing this, William got even angrier. He used all his strength to torment her. Victoria's body convulsed, tears falling like broken beads.

William's breathing got heavier. He picked up Victoria and threw her onto the nearby bed, turning her over so she was facing away from him. He then lifted her butt, making it easier for him to move in and out.

Victoria bit her lip, enduring his assault, already crying uncontrollably.

Looking at Victoria's pale face and fragile figure, William suddenly felt something stir inside him, making him soften for a moment. His movements then became gentler. He turned her over, squeezed her breasts, and slowly massaged them before burying his head in them, his lips and tongue lingering on her chest.

Victoria felt a wave of uncontrollable desire surge through her body, making her both ashamed and in pain. She thought, 'How could I feel this way when I'm being forced?'

William kept smacking Victoria's delicate private parts, sometimes lightly, sometimes heavily, occasionally nibbling on her nipples.

Victoria's body trembled involuntarily. She twisted her waist uneasily, clamping her legs tightly, trying to block William's advances.

Seeing this, William got even more excited. His movements became more vigorous, as if he wanted to completely dominate her.

Victoria fainted several times from his torment. When she woke up, her body was exhausted and in pain. She lay on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling with empty eyes.

William stood by the window smoking, the smoke lingering in front of the glass. His brows were tightly furrowed, his handsome yet sinister face partially obscured by the hazy smoke, making it hard to see clearly.

He saw Victoria wake up, and his pupils contracted as he quickly put out the cigarette.

Victoria trembled as she picked up the torn clothes on the floor, wrapping them tightly around herself, then put on the crumpled coat. Her eyes were cold, like ice, devoid of any emotion.

Looking at William, Victoria said hoarsely but firmly, "Mr. Scott, no matter what you do to me, I won't change my decision."

William seemed to calm down a bit. Looking at Victoria's stubborn face, he felt a surge of complex emotions.

After a moment of silence, he said coldly, "Fine, since you're so determined, I agree. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other."

Hearing William's words, Victoria felt a mix of relief and an odd sense of loss. But she knew this was the path she had to take. She silently turned around and walked out under William's intense gaze.

William stood there, watching her leave, his eyes filled with deep and complex emotions.

After leaving the Scott Group, Victoria felt like a huge weight had been lifted off her shoulders. She wandered through the busy supermarket, carefully picking out fresh vegetables and fruits.

Thinking of Elara's kindness and support, she decided to cook a special meal for her. Back at her place, Victoria got busy. She laid out the ingredients on the kitchen counter: fresh greens, red tomatoes, plump mushrooms, all looking vibrant and delicious.

She tied on her apron, washed her hands, and got ready to whip up a feast. She skillfully picked up a knife and started chopping vegetables.

Hearing the noise, Elara came into the kitchen and smiled. "Victoria, let me help you out."

Victoria smiled back and said, "Elara, since I'm the one inviting you today, there's no way I'm letting you help."

Elara waved her hand and said, "It's fine. If we do it together, it'll be faster."

Soon, the kitchen was filled with mouth-watering aromas, and a variety of delicious dishes were laid out on the table.

Victoria made several home-cooked dishes: glossy roasted chicken, sweet and sour tomato pasta, colorful beef bourguignon, and mushroom soup.

Elara's face lit up with a smile when she saw the spread, and she couldn't help but praise. "Victoria, your cooking skills are amazing."

Victoria blushed and then invited Elara to sit down and taste her cooking.

Elara sat at the table, tasting Victoria's dishes, and kept praising. "This is really delicious! Your cooking skills are as good as a restaurant chef's."

Victoria laughed and responded, "Oh, you're too kind!"

The two enjoyed the food and chatted happily.

As they ate, Elara sighed, "Victoria, your cooking is so good. I wish my son could taste it. He's a lawyer, always traveling for work. Sometimes it's hard to get him to come home for a meal."

Hearing this, Victoria gently comforted, "Being busy is a good thing for young people; it shows he has ambition."

"That's true, but I still worry about his health and wish he could spend more time with me!" Elara sighed, then asked, "Victoria, I noticed you used to be very busy, often working late into the night. It's not the weekend today, so how do you have time to invite me to dinner?"

Victoria lowered her eyes, hiding the sadness in them, "Actually, I quit my job."

"Quit? That's good!" Elara looked at Victoria with concern and said, "I noticed you always came home late and left early, often looking sickly. Your job didn't treat you well. Look at you, so weak and thin. It's good to change jobs, don't wear yourself out."

Saying this, Elara put some food into Victoria's bowl. "Eat more, you're too thin."

Victoria felt warmth in her heart, and her eyes moistened. "Elara, thank you," she said.

"By the way, what are your plans for the future?" Elara asked with concern.

Victoria hesitated for a moment, then said, "I've reached out to a real estate company. They offer decent pay and don't care much about education. You know, I didn't finish college..."

###chapter 16 Starry Studio Gallery

Victoria figured that even though Alvin's company had tanked, she still had some old connections. If she could just push past the awkwardness and hustle, she might be able to make some sales.

At least she could still cover Nora's medical bills and Bobby's tuition. Thinking about the ungrateful Nora and selfish Bobby, Victoria had thought about just cutting them off, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. She was just too soft-hearted.

Elara noticed her looking a bit unsure and felt really bad for such a sweet and sensible girl who had to deal with so much.

She grabbed Victoria's hand and said, "Victoria, don't sell yourself short. You're smart and beautiful. Don't lose hope. I have a job that would be perfect for you. Would you consider it?"

"That's too much trouble for you!" Victoria shook her head. She didn't want to be a burden to Elara.

Elara patted her hand and smiled, "It's no trouble at all! I'm just giving you a chance. Whether you make it or not is up to you."

She went on, "I have a friend who owns an art gallery and is hiring. You have a knack for painting, so working there would be great. The pay's decent, the environment is nice, and you'll be around people who love art. You'll get to see all kinds of beautiful pieces and meet artists and collectors. It's a great opportunity for you. You can definitely shine there."

Victoria was interested but still worried. She said, "But Elara, I don't have much education. I'm afraid I'll embarrass you if I go there."

Elara waved her hand and said confidently, "How could you embarrass me? I'm just making the introduction. They hire ten interns each time, but only keep two. It's up to you to earn your spot."

Hearing this, Victoria thought for a while and realized that working at the gallery was indeed better than selling real estate. She had been painting since she was a kid and knew a bit about famous and up-and-coming artists.

Plus, even though Nora didn't like her, Victoria had been around art sales since she was young and knew quite a bit about it.

If she worked hard and learned more, she should be able to handle the job. Thinking of this, she didn't refuse anymore and nodded. "Okay, I'll give it a shot."

Elara immediately smiled and said, "Great, I'll take you there tomorrow."

"Elara, I'll go by myself," Victoria quickly said. "I can't trouble you."

But Elara insisted, "No way, you're my recommendation. I have to support you."

Victoria couldn't argue with her, so she agreed.

The next day, Victoria put on a professional suit and light makeup to cover her pale face. Feeling a bit nervous, she followed Elara to the gallery.

The gallery was on a quiet street, in a unique white building with a geometric design. Large floor-to-ceiling windows acted like transparent mirrors, letting sunlight flood the interior and light up the exquisite artworks. The walls were decked out with all kinds of paintings, from classic pieces by famous artists like Claude Monet's "Impression Sunrise" to fresh, innovative works by up-and-comers like Joshua Thomas.

Besides the paintings, the gallery also had some stunning sculptures on display.

Victoria was carefully admiring a painting, trying to soak up some inspiration, when a young woman with an elegant vibe and a stern face walked up to her.

The woman's shiny blonde hair was neatly tied back, and her delicate face was framed by black-rimmed glasses, giving her an intellectual look. She was Diana Simpson, Elara's friend's daughter, who now ran the gallery.

Elara warmly introduced Victoria to Diana. "Diana, this is Victoria. I've told you about her. She's a talented painter and is hoping to start working here."

Diana's face immediately lit up with a warm smile when she saw Elara. She kindly shook Victoria's hand and said, "Welcome to our gallery, Victoria. I've heard about you from Elara. It's nice to meet you."

Seeing Diana's enthusiasm, Elara felt reassured. She turned to Victoria and said, "Victoria, do your best here. If you have any questions, just ask Diana."

With that, Elara got ready to leave the gallery. But as soon as Elara turned around, Diana's expression turned cold. She looked Victoria up and down with a mix of disdain and skepticism.

Victoria's smile froze for a moment, and she lowered her eyes slightly, politely saying, "Hello, Ms. Simpson."

"Hello," Diana replied indifferently. "Were you just admiring this painting, 'Song of the Valley'?"

"Yes," Victoria answered honestly.

"What do you like about it?" Diana asked.

"The technique is excellent, the composition is profound, and the colors are perfectly matched," Victoria said sincerely.

Diana said, "You have some insight, but Starry Studio Gallery is one of the top galleries in the country. We only hire graduates from prestigious schools. Do you think you have what it takes to succeed here?"

She stared coldly at Victoria, not hiding her contempt and mockery. Victoria's heart sank. She knew Diana had agreed to let her intern only because of Elara's request, not because Diana valued her.

It was understandable. If she were Diana, she wouldn't want to waste time and effort evaluating someone who hadn't even attended college.

There might have been hidden talents among the general public, but the chances were slim. Top universities tended to concentrate more outstanding individuals. Even if someone possessed undiscovered talents, without a degree from a reputable university, the company didn't have the time to seek one out.

Victoria pressed her lips together and calmly looked up at Diana, saying, "I understand your concerns. But since Elara got me this opportunity, I still want to try. If I don't meet your standards, I will leave on my own without causing any trouble."

###chapter 17 Internship Training

Victoria's tone was so genuine and straightforward. 

Diana was a bit surprised, her thin eyebrows arched slightly. She hadn't expected this seemingly gentle and fragile girl to have such courage. A mocking smile curled at the corner of her lips as she thought, 'This little girl really thinks she can take on the world. Fine, let's see what she's got.'

Then, with a nonchalant air, she spoke, "If you want to go down this path, I won't stop you. Follow me."

Victoria let out a sigh of relief, knowing she had cleared the first hurdle.

Diana gathered all the interns, crossing her arms and giving them a cold once-over. "I've brought you all here to get acquainted. You'll be interning together and competing for the only two permanent spots," she said, her voice icy and detached.

The interns stood at attention, anxiously waiting for the introductions to start.

Diana gave a slight nod, signaling the first person to begin.

A tall, striking girl stepped forward, lifting her chin confidently. "I'm Wendy Clark, a graduate of Rainbow Creative University. I've been painting since I was a kid, diving into traditional techniques and exploring new artistic expressions. I'm excited to learn more at Starry Studio Gallery."

Her intro got a few nods of admiration, and everyone looked at her with respect.

Next up was a calm, bespectacled young man. "Hey everyone, I'm Irvin Hays, a graduate of the University of Aesthetics Shine. I'm into modern art and have worked on several international projects with my mentor. If I get to stay at Starry Studio Gallery, I'll give it my all." His intro also earned some recognition and praise.

The interns took turns introducing themselves, most of them from top art schools, brimming with pride and confidence.

When it was Victoria's turn, she felt the scrutinizing eyes on her. Taking a deep breath, she introduced herself as calmly as she could, "Hi everyone, I'm Victoria Carter. I didn't graduate from a fancy art school, just high school, but I have a strong passion for painting. I'll work hard to learn and contribute here."

After her intro, the room fell silent for a moment before a few low chuckles broke the stillness. Someone whispered, "A high school grad interning here? Is this a joke?" 

Another added, "Yeah, this is a professional gallery. What could she possibly know?"

The looks of disdain and the sneers from the people around her made Victoria's cheeks feel like they were on fire, while their judgments felt like needles stabbing her heart.

Diana's lips curled into a mocking smile.

"Alright, intros are done. From now on, everyone needs to give it their all. Anyone who falls short is out," she said before turning and leaving the interns to whisper among themselves.

Across the street from the gallery, a black Maybach was parked. William sat in the driver's seat, watching the distant Starry Studio Gallery through the rearview mirror.

"Mr. Scott, Ms. Carter is about to officially join this gallery. Are you really not going to stop her?" Harry asked.

William withdrew his gaze and looked at Harry in the passenger seat, speaking slowly, "No need, she won't get the job."

Harry asked again, "But what if she does get the job?"

"Does she think she can shake me off that easily? Not a chance," William sneered. "Get in touch with the head of the Simpson family. I have some business to discuss."

Harry was taken aback for a moment before he reacted, feeling a pang of worry for Victoria and shaking his head slightly.

Victoria and the other interns started their training.

During this process, the trainer scored the interns, and after the training, the five with the lowest scores were cut. Only those who made it through could start the actual internship. It was tough, but most people thought it was fair.

On the first day of training, they gathered in the conference room of Starry Studio Gallery.

Frank, an experienced and knowledgeable art appraisal expert, was the trainer. He kicked things off by introducing the history of Starry Studio Gallery, then shifted the focus to practical work training.

The hands-on training started with the layout of the exhibition hall.

Frank took the interns to the gallery's exhibition hall and explained in detail how to arrange the layout according to different artworks and exhibition themes.

"The layout of the exhibition hall should consider the style, color, and size of the works so that visitors can feel the artistic atmosphere the moment they enter," he said, showing them how it was done.

Victoria watched Frank's every move closely, silently noting the key points.

When it was the interns' turn to practice, Wendy confidently pointed to a spot slightly to the right in the middle and said, "This painting should go here to better highlight its colors."

Other interns chimed in with their opinions, but most weren't much different from Wendy's.

Frank then looked at Victoria, who had been quiet, and asked, "What do you think?"

Victoria pursed her lips and stepped forward. She looked around and then said to Frank, "I think this painting would also look good in that corner, creating a dialogue with the sculpture next to it."

Hearing this, Wendy glanced at Victoria with slight disdain and said, "What do you know? I studied professional exhibition layout in school. You're just a high school graduate, so don't make random suggestions."

Victoria's face turned slightly red, but she didn't back down and continued to insist on her point of view. "Although I don't have a professional background, I believe art is diverse, and different layouts can bring different effects."

Some interns sided with Wendy, while others thought Victoria's idea had some merit, and they began to argue.

Frank was quite surprised by Victoria, and her layout did have a unique beauty. However, he didn't speak up; he just listened carefully to the interns' debate.

After a while, he smiled and said, "It's good that everyone has their own ideas. We can try different layouts and see which one works best."

In the end, with everyone's efforts, the exhibition hall was arranged very well. The painting ended up being placed according to Wendy's suggestion, which was neither remarkable nor incorrect.

Victoria's opinion, however, went unnoticed.

###chapter 18 Art Exhibition

Next up was customer reception training. Frank really hammered home the importance of good manners and a positive attitude to the interns. He said, "Always keep a smile on your face and greet every customer with enthusiasm and professionalism. Be proactive in asking about their needs and give them personalized service."

He even set up some role-playing scenarios so the interns could practice talking to customers.

Victoria was a bit jittery at first, but with more practice, she started to get the hang of it.

This time, Irvin played the customer and threw some tough questions at Victoria. "Why is this painting so expensive? Is it really worth the price?" he asked.

Victoria smiled politely and said, "The price of a painting depends on several factors. This artist is very famous and has achieved a lot in the art world. Plus, the technique is top-notch and the subject matter is unique. I think true art lovers can see its value."

Irvin kept pushing, "But what if I think this painting doesn't match my home decor?"

Victoria paused for a moment and then said, "We have a variety of styles in our gallery. What's your home decor like? I can suggest some pieces that might fit better."

Her answer wasn't perfect, but it was pretty good for an intern.

Frank was impressed with Victoria's performance and gave her high marks.

Next was the artwork explanation training, which was also super important.

Frank picked out a few key pieces to show how to explain them to customers. He said, "When you're explaining a piece, you should talk about the artist's background, their creative style, and the theme of the work. This helps customers understand its meaning and value better..."

Frank's explanations were clear and insightful, and the interns learned a lot. Victoria listened carefully, jotting down notes in her notebook.

During the practice session, Victoria asked Wendy for help with an abstract painting. She said, "Wendy, I don't really get this painting. Can you share your thoughts with me?"

Wendy was a bit hesitant at first, but she saw how sincere Victoria was and patiently explained, "This painting is an abstract expressionist piece. The artist uses colors and lines to express inner emotions and thoughts. See, the vibrant colors here show the artist's passion."

Victoria listened intently, asking questions now and then.

Wendy realized that even though Victoria was just out of high school, she had a keen eye for art and often noticed details others missed. Victoria's clear thinking and ability to connect the dots impressed Wendy.

Victoria was also pleasantly surprised that Wendy, who seemed so proud, was genuinely helpful, which made her warm up to Wendy. Their interactions became more and more enjoyable.

After the lesson, Victoria thanked Wendy.

"Thanks a lot, Wendy!" Victoria said gratefully, "I really learned a lot from you today."

Wendy waved it off and said, "No problem, let's help each other out."

Knowing she had a lot to learn, Victoria worked even harder to make the most of every learning opportunity. After each day's training, Victoria would hang back in the conference room to go over what she had learned. At home, she'd dive into art books and magazines to expand her knowledge. 

Before she knew it, the weekend rolled around, and Wendy told her about an art exhibition featuring works by the up-and-coming artist Joshua.

Victoria was super excited about this since she had always admired Joshua's work. With some free time on her hands, she decided to check out the art museum on her own.

In the spacious, well-lit exhibition hall, beautiful paintings hung on the white walls, each one telling its own captivating story.

Victoria was completely drawn in by these works and eagerly started to appreciate them. She stood quietly in front of a painting that had a strong visual impact, with bold colors and a unique composition that created a powerful effect.

Victoria quickly pulled out her notebook and jotted down her impressions: [The colors are vibrant and full of energy, and the composition is unique, giving a strong visual impact.]

As she wrote, she closely observed every detail of the painting, trying to understand the artist's creative intentions.

Next, she moved on to another of Joshua's works, which had a totally different vibe-a sunset over the ocean, with golden light shimmering on the waves, creating an unparalleled beauty.

With delicate brushstrokes and soft colors, it created a peaceful and warm atmosphere.

Victoria picked up her notebook again and wrote: [Delicate brushstrokes, soft colors, creating a peaceful and warm atmosphere. The artist's emotions flow gently through the painting, bringing a sense of inner tranquility.]

She was so immersed in the world of the paintings that she completely lost track of time and ignored the figure quietly appearing beside her.

She looked up and saw a man who appeared to be in his late twenties. He had a lean build and a light stubble on his face, giving him a mature and charming look.

He wore a simple yet elegant white shirt with the sleeves slightly rolled up, revealing his strong arms and giving off a vibe of casual elegance.

Victoria noticed his slightly worn nails, a sign of long hours spent with art supplies. His slightly messy hair perfectly complemented his artistic aura, making him seem lively and unrestrained.

"Do you like this painting? You've been standing here for a while," he said with a slight smile, his voice deep and magnetic, giving off a warm and friendly vibe.

Hearing his words, Victoria was momentarily stunned, then politely responded, "Yes, this painting brings a sense of inner peace, making past troubles seem like fleeting clouds, leaving only a longing for beauty."

He chuckled softly at her response and said, "Your thoughts are quite unique."

Victoria smiled shyly.

"My name is Samuel Brown," he introduced himself, extending a friendly hand. "May I have the honor of knowing your name?" he asked.

###chapter 19 Who Is That Man?

"Hello, I'm Victoria," she said, giving Samuel a polite handshake before letting go.

"Are you an art school student?" Samuel asked.

Victoria's smile faltered, and she awkwardly shook her head. "Nope, I didn't go to college. I'm already working, interning at a gallery."

Samuel gave her a thoughtful look and then smiled. "Skipping college isn't a big deal. It's what you do that counts. You seem really into painting. Our University of Aesthetics Shine has some public lectures every week. You might find them interesting."

"Really?" Victoria's heart was instantly flooded with excitement. The University of Aesthetics Shine was the kind of place every art student dreamed of getting into!

But just as quickly, her expression fell. "The university doesn't allow outsiders. Even if I wanted to go, I couldn't get in."

Samuel chuckled. "Don't worry about it. I'm a professor there. If you really want to attend, I can get you a pass."

Victoria looked at him in surprise, not expecting him to be a professor. She quickly composed herself and said, "Thank you, but wouldn't that be too much trouble?"

"No need to refuse. I appreciate talent, and it's just a small favor," Samuel said with a hearty laugh.

Victoria's face broke into a big smile as she nodded gratefully. "Thank you so much! Can I treat you to a meal to show my appreciation?" she asked.

"I'd be delighted!" Samuel agreed without hesitation.

As they walked out of the art gallery, Victoria suddenly felt dizzy, and her vision began to blur. She tried to steady herself, but her body swayed uncontrollably, and she was about to faint.

Seeing this, Samuel quickly supported her. "Are you feeling unwell?" he asked with concern.

Victoria weakly replied, "I might be having a hypoglycemic episode; I'm feeling a bit lightheaded."

Without a word, Samuel ran out of the gallery and soon returned with some candy and drinks. He handed them to Victoria and said, "Eat something. You'll feel better."

Victoria gratefully took the candy and drinks and started eating. After a while, her color gradually returned, and she felt much better.

They then had a quick meal at a nearby restaurant. After leaving the restaurant, Samuel noticed that Victoria still didn't look well and said worriedly, "I should take you home. What if you faint again on the way?"

Victoria didn't want to trouble anyone, but given her current condition, she reluctantly agreed. So, Samuel drove Victoria to her apartment complex.

After getting out of the car, Victoria smiled and thanked Samuel. Once Samuel drove away, Victoria slowly walked towards her building.

Unbeknownst to her, William was sitting in the back seat of a black Maybach, staring intently at Victoria and Samuel through the window. It was as if his gaze could burn right through the glass.

He got out of the car and walked straight towards Victoria. Victoria was unlocking the door when she heard hurried footsteps behind her. She turned around in confusion and saw William standing there. Her eyes widened in fear, and she instinctively tried to run. But terror overwhelmed her, and her legs turned to jelly.

"Trying to escape? Too late," William said, grabbing Victoria's arm.

Victoria struggled desperately and shouted, "Let go of me! What do you want?"

William wrapped an arm around her waist, pushed the door open with the other, and dragged her inside, slamming the door shut behind them.

"William, are you crazy? Let go of me, or I'll scream for help!" Victoria struggled angrily, but William's grip was like iron, giving her no chance to resist.

"Who was the guy who brought you home?" William asked coldly, squinting at her.

"What does it matter to you?" Victoria snapped, using all her strength to break free from his grip. She took a few steps back, watching him warily.

"How does it not matter to me?" William cornered her, lifted her chin, and forced her to look into his eyes. "How dare you flirt with another man? Do you have a death wish?" he pressed.

Victoria shivered in fear and gritted her teeth. "I've told you before, we're done!"

"Done?" William's lips curled into a sinister smile. He grabbed her neck and pinned her against the cold, hard wall. "I just accepted your resignation. Did I ever agree to end our deal? You'll never get rid of me! I bought you, and I'll do whatever I want with you. Unless I get bored, you can forget about leaving!"

With that, he tore Victoria's dress apart.

"No!" Victoria screamed, trying to stop him, but it was futile. Her delicate skin was exposed to the air, glistening enticingly.

A flash of desire crossed William's eyes, and his breathing grew heavier. He lowered his head and took her tender nipple into his mouth.

Victoria winced in pain, curling her legs and clutching her chest. "William, please, don't!" she sobbed, pleading.

"You're mine. Why can't I touch you?" William sneered, his hands roaming over her body.

Tears streamed down Victoria's face. She cried out, "It's not like that!"

William responded, "Then tell me, what is it like?" He lowered his head, kissing every inch of her tender skin.

Victoria was mortified, desperately trying to escape, but she couldn't break free from William, who bit her smooth skin like a beast, leaving a row of deep red teeth marks.

When his lips reached her most sensitive spot, Victoria broke down again, her eyes empty and hopeless.

"William, let me go, please!" Victoria cried, begging.

"Why should I let you go?" William sneered. "What right do you have to defy me?"

With that, he pushed Victoria onto the sofa, tore off his tie, and roughly tied her flailing hands. He kissed Victoria's inner thighs more aggressively, leaving a trail of intimate marks.

Victoria closed her eyes in pain, tears streaming down her delicate cheeks. Her eyes widened, and she pounded on his strong chest.

But William didn't care. He unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his muscular chest. His long fingers slid under her skirt, caressing her supple skin. Slowly, he pulled down her panties.

###chapter 20 A Faint Glimmer of Light

Victoria shut her eyes in despair, a single tear slipping down her cheek.

William unzipped his pants, letting his hot, erect member free, and slowly entered her. Victoria's body went rigid, trembling even more. Her hands clenched into fists, nails digging into her skin, drawing thin lines of blood.

William enjoyed her body with a satisfied grin, panting, "Victoria, remember, your body is mine. You can't escape."

Hearing this, Victoria was filled with hatred. She suddenly bit down on his shoulder.

William grunted but didn't pull away. Moments later, he pulled out and then thrust back in harder, whispering in her ear, "Isn't this exciting? I love seeing you get aroused because of me."

Victoria pressed her lips together, staying silent. She'd rather endure the physical and mental torment than let William see her vulnerable.

William sensed her stubbornness and got even angrier. He thrust forcefully, sending his large, erect member deep inside her.

Victoria felt a surge of electricity spread through her body, arching her back and moaning.

"Moan louder, enjoy it more!" William looked at her with a wicked smile, his hand caressing her breasts.

Victoria bit her lip, shaking her head desperately, her vision blurred by tears.

"The more pitiful you look, the more I want to ravage you!" William said with a cold laugh.

Before he finished speaking, he suddenly pulled out and flipped Victoria over, making her lie on the coffee table. Victoria's body went rigid, tears flowing, trembling uncontrollably.

William looked at her trembling back with intense pleasure. Victoria's body was too beautiful, making him unable to stop. The curve of her back was particularly enticing. He bent down, kissing her buttocks, leaving red marks.

Victoria shamefully wiggled her hips, trying to escape. But William wouldn't let her, pressing her waist down with his hand, forcing her to raise her hips. With a forceful thrust, he entered her completely.

Victoria let out a broken sound, her brows furrowing in pain, her hands gripping the tablecloth, her body convulsing.

Seeing this, William thrust even harder. Victoria's head spun and her body went limp, as if she had lost consciousness, leaving only the rising pleasure and tingling sensation deep within her.

After an unknown amount of time, William finally released. He didn't pull out immediately but lay on top of Victoria, panting, his sweat-drenched hair sticking to his forehead and nose.

By this time, Victoria had fallen into a deep sleep. Her delicate features were pale from exhaustion, her brow furrowed, and her expression filled with pain.

William gazed at her for a while, then picked up a towel to clean her body and helped her change into loose, comfortable loungewear. After doing all this, he didn't leave immediately but sat by the bed, watching the sleeping Victoria.

Her tear-streaked face highlighted her smooth, delicate skin, and her slightly curled eyelashes trembled like butterfly wings. Even in sleep, she frowned, clearly not at peace. As William gazed at her sleeping face, a complicated expression flashed in his eyes.

He stood up, walked to the balcony, and lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around and blurring his handsome face. As his phone buzzed in his pocket, he took it out and answered.

"Mr. Scott, I've sent the information about the new secretaries to your email. Please check it," the HR manager said respectfully.

"Okay," William responded and hung up. He opened his inbox and saw the new emails with photos and resumes attached.

William skimmed through them. They were all graduates from top universities, young, beautiful, and capable.

But he thought to himself, 'Their eyes are too big and lifeless. This one's too short; I'd have to look down to speak. That one's been abroad too long and doesn't understand the domestic situation.'

Out of a dozen candidates, none satisfied him, so William stubbed out his cigarette in frustration. He called the HR manager back and said in a low voice, "What kind of people did you choose? Re-select!"

"But Mr. Scott, we've already recommended dozens of secretaries to you recently," the HR manager said, sounding aggrieved. "It's really hard to find anyone with better resumes than them!"

"Do I pay you tens of thousands of dollars a month to hear this nonsense?" William suppressed his anger and said in a deep voice, "Find better ones immediately! Otherwise, don't blame me for firing you!"

"Got it!" the HR manager replied meekly, swallowing the words he wanted to say, "Should I bring Ms. Carter back?"

But he ultimately didn't dare and could only sigh, continuing to sift through the endless resumes.

After hanging up, William rubbed his temples. How did he end up with such a bunch of idiots? Thinking about the chaotic work state these days, William lit another cigarette.

After Victoria left, the HR department immediately assigned him a new secretary, but unlike Victoria, she couldn't even make coffee, organize documents properly, or understand the preferences of negotiation partners.

Thinking of Victoria, William felt even more irritated. He looked around Victoria's shabby rental apartment, which had only a small one-bedroom, no TV.

His gaze was drawn to the stack of paintings in the corner. Despite the small space, Victoria had meticulously arranged dozens of completed works neatly together.

There was also an unfinished painting-a dark background like an endless abyss, with a lonely figure curled up in the corner, surrounded by vague shadows. The lines of the figure were twisted, seemingly enduring immense pain. But in the figure's hand was a tightly held paintbrush, its tip glowing faintly, like a light of hope struggling to survive in the darkness.

The use of color was also extremely oppressive, with deep tones conveying an indescribable despair. However, within this despair, there was a hint of stubbornness and resilience.

William's gaze was fixed on the painting, a deep surprise in his eyes. Having received an elite education since childhood, he had a keen appreciation for art and could naturally discern the level of skill in a painting.

Victoria's work, while still immature in technique, conveyed emotions that surged like an undercurrent, deeply affecting his heart.

###chapter 21 A Slap

William stared at the painting for what felt like forever. He finally tore his eyes away and glanced at the small bookshelf crammed with books, mostly about painting and art sales.

He picked one up and noticed that every book was filled with Victoria's notes, her handwriting neat and elegant, each page brimming with insights and reflections.

She must really love painting and her job at Starry Studio Gallery. Thinking this, William felt a weird sensation in his chest, making him second-guess what he was about to do.

But that doubt vanished the moment he saw the photos, most of which were of Victoria and Alvin, with Victoria smiling shyly and Alvin looking all gentle.

A few were of her with Nora and Bobby, with Nora and Bobby holding hands intimately, while Victoria stood off to the side like she didn't belong.

But she had these photos in a prominent spot and kept them clean, clearly cherishing them.

When William saw Alvin, a wave of hatred and disgust washed over him, and his eyes turned icy.

As his gaze shifted to the wall, he saw it was covered with notes and schedules from when Victoria was his secretary. It was packed with meticulous records of his schedule and preferences, showing she hadn't had time to clear them out. Among these busy records was a drawing of him with a pig's head-not a cute pink pig, but a fierce wild boar with tusks!

William sneered, wanting to tear the drawing to shreds and toss it in the trash, but for some reason, he lowered his hand. He thought, 'Forget it. The drawing is actually pretty good; it'd be a shame to ruin it.'

After their encounter, he felt a bit hungry and turned to the fridge to find something to eat. But the fridge was almost empty, just canned food and instant noodles, no other ingredients.

There wasn't a single bag of chips, chocolate, or any snacks that young girls usually liked. No fresh fruit or milk either. Hard to believe this was the home of a girl who had just turned 20. No wonder Victoria always looked so thin.

Thinking of this, William was overwhelmed by a strange mix of emotions, which robbed him of his appetite. He tossed the cigarette he was holding aside, walked to the bedroom door, opened it a crack, and stared at Victoria on the bed.

Her body was curled up, her legs tightly clamped together in a posture that exuded both fear and vulnerability. Tears streaked her delicate face, making her appear heartbreakingly pitiful.

William felt a pang in his heart, and his throat tightened. He admitted that although he loathed her, he liked her body. Even after just finishing, he could feel his desire stirring again. But seeing her like this now, he thought, 'It's better to just forget about it.'

William walked into the room, closed the door, took off his clothes, and got into bed. Victoria, half-asleep, vaguely felt something warm next to her. Feeling cold and tired, she instinctively moved closer to the warmth.

William's body tensed, but he didn't pull away.

Victoria murmured in her sleep, "So warm."

William looked down at her peaceful face and felt a tenderness he hadn't expected. He pulled Victoria into his arms, lowering his head to press his lips gently against her soft hair. Closing his eyes, he inhaled the faint, sweet scent of her hair, feeling himself getting lost in it.

The next morning, Victoria opened her eyes to see a handsome face.

William's eyes were closed, his long eyelashes casting shadows on his eye sockets. His chiseled features, with a straight and well-defined nose, were like a sculpture. However, this charming appearance filled Victoria with terror.

"Why are you still here!" Victoria screamed, breaking free from his embrace, and jumped out of bed, throwing a pillow at him.

William was awakened and opened his sleepy eyes impatiently. "Are you crazy?" William shouted.

"Get out of my bedroom! I hate you!" Victoria shouted, her eyes red.

William narrowed his gem-like eyes, staring at her dangerously, and sternly snapped, "Say that to me one more time!"

Victoria gritted her teeth and said, "This is my home! I don't want to see you here! Please leave!"

William's face suddenly darkened. Victoria was only obedient when she was asleep! He suddenly grabbed Victoria's slender shoulders, pinning her against the wall, and warned her word by word, "Victoria, do you know who you're talking to? You're just my sugar baby, what right do you have to order me around?"

"We've already done!" Victoria glared at him angrily and said, "William, I'm not your property, I'm a person!"

William sneered, "Aren't you someone who can be paid to have sex? Why are you pretending to be chaste now? When I fucked you in the bathroom, didn't you moan with pleasure?"

His tone was mocking and disdainful, as if Victoria was just a cheap prostitute in front of him. Trembling with anger and almost consumed by rage, Victoria couldn't take it anymore and slapped him hard. The crisp sound of the slap echoed in the room, and both of them were stunned.

William touched his right cheek, his deep eyes filled with intense fury, and coldly said, "You're asking for it!"

Victoria realized she had made a big mistake in her impulsiveness. She closed her eyes, trembling, bracing herself for the storm of blows.

But the expected pain never came. She slowly opened one eye and saw William's fist suspended in mid-air, not coming down. His face was livid, his eyes cold, and veins bulging on his forehead.

Victoria was terrified, trembling.

William glared at her fiercely before turning and slamming the door as he left. The loud bang made the entire door shake, causing Victoria to tremble all over.

Victoria let out a sigh of relief and collapsed on the bed.

William stormed downstairs, where Harry was already waiting with the car at the door. His face was dark, and he said nothing as he opened the back door and got in.

Seeing William's grim expression, Harry quickly asked, "Mr. Scott, what happened?"

William said, "Get in touch with Mr. Simpson and tell him I accept his offer."

Harry frowned and said, "That amount is enough to buy out an entire top-tier gallery, yet he's only offering half the shares..."

"Enough," William snapped, his face growing darker. "Get it done."

"Got it," Harry replied, not daring to question further, and sped off.

###chapter 22 Why Did She Get a Higher Score Than Me

Victoria lay in bed for what felt like forever, still shaken up. She couldn't believe she had actually slapped that jerk William, and he didn't even hit back. It felt pretty good, like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders, making her feel a lot more relaxed.

She glanced at the clock and realized she was almost late for work. She quickly washed up, changed clothes, and headed to Starry Studio Gallery.

The interns' training had one more week to go. At the end of the week, there'd be an exam, and combined with their usual performance scores, the five lowest-scoring interns would be cut.

The training schedule was jam-packed, with everything from deep dives into art history to intense client communication training and hands-on art appreciation exercises. Every bit of it was important.

Unlike the other interns, Victoria wasn't feeling too confident. She was on edge and threw herself into studying like her life depended on it. She took detailed notes, used every spare moment to memorize, and even reviewed her notes while eating, which got her some teasing from the other interns.

"Victoria, you're working so hard. Do you really think a top gallery like Starry Studio Gallery would keep a high school grad like you?"

"Yeah, you're probably wasting your time!"

"We learned all this stuff in college. Don't you think it's a bit late to start cramming now?"

But Victoria ignored them and kept her head down, writing.

Wendy, who admired Victoria's determination, couldn't stand it anymore and spoke up. "Don't underestimate people. Where there's a will, there's a way. I believe Victoria can do it."

Wendy came from a well-off background, so people like Lyra Cole, who mocked Victoria, didn't dare argue with her.

Victoria heard Wendy defending her and looked up, giving her a grateful smile. Wendy responded with a thumbs-up, showing her support.

During the practical training in client communication skills, a high-profile client showed up. He was dressed to the nines, wore gold-rimmed glasses, and had his hair perfectly styled. He looked like someone who could drop serious cash on art.

Lyra, brimming with confidence, was the first to greet him.

She warmly welcomed him, "Hello, welcome to our gallery."

But the client just glanced at her and said, "Why do all these paintings look so mediocre?"

Lyra quickly pointed to a brightly colored oil painting, "This piece is by one of our gallery's popular artists. The brushwork is delicate, and the colors are harmonious. Look how vivid the scene is."

The client frowned and said, "Too flashy, tacky!"

Lyra then suggested a simple sketch, but the client dismissed it as "Too plain!"

She tried everything to please the client, but he wasn't having it. In the end, she had to give up, frustrated. Other interns stepped up to try, including the highly regarded Wendy and Irvin.

But whether they talked about art history or the works' collection value, they couldn't impress the picky client. Everyone looked dejected and confused.

Just when everyone was at a loss, Victoria took a deep breath and gathered the courage to approach the client. She smiled and said, "Hey there, looks like you have pretty high standards for art."

The client glanced at her but didn't say anything.

Victoria didn't back down. "Art is super subjective. Everyone sees beauty differently. When do you plan to enjoy the painting?"

The client seemed a bit surprised by her question. After a moment, he said, "I want something I can enjoy in my downtime."

Victoria immediately thought of a landscape painting tucked away in the corner of the gallery. She led him over and softly introduced it, "Check this out. The artist uses delicate brushstrokes and a unique composition to create these serene, beautiful landscapes. The subtle tones give off a sense of tranquility and depth. I think this might be what you're looking for."

The client examined the painting closely, showing a hint of interest. But he didn't decide right away. Instead, he asked, "Who's the artist? What are his works like? Is the price reasonable?"

Victoria patiently answered all his questions. She talked about the artist's background and style and explained how the price was determined. Her answers were professional and sincere, without any fluff, making them easy to listen to.

After hearing her out, the client finally nodded and said, "Alright, I'll take it."

"Thank you so much!" Victoria was thrilled and quickly took the painting down to pack it carefully.

The painting was priced at over thirty thousand dollars, but the client paid without hesitation and even mentioned he'd be back if he needed more art.

Victoria thanked him sincerely. The other interns were green with envy and secretly cursed her luck. Only Wendy was genuinely happy for her.

Diana and Frank had been watching everything.

Finally, Friday rolled around, and it was time for the final assessment.

The test covered a bunch of topics, including art history, gallery management, and customer service. Victoria had reviewed everything meticulously and was extra careful while answering.

After the assessment, all the interns anxiously waited for the results, nervously seated in the packed gallery conference room.

Frank and Diana stood at the front, ready to announce the scores.

When Frank read out each person's score, the room was filled with anticipation and anxiety. As the scores were announced, some were happy, and some were disappointed. Those with higher scores smiled with relief, while those with lower scores looked dejected.

"Victoria, fifth place," Frank announced clearly. When her score was announced, there was a small commotion in the room.

Victoria was overjoyed to have secured her place with a fifth-place finish. But then, Irvin stood up. As a top graduate from the University of Aesthetics Shine, he was filled with resentment and anger after being eliminated in the first round.

"I question the fairness of this assessment! How can a high school graduate like Victoria score higher than me? There must be a mistake," he exclaimed, glaring at Victoria with a fierce look and gritted teeth.

###chapter 23 She is More Talented Than You

Victoria's body went rigid, and she stood there, stunned. Irvin's questioning was like a bomb dropped in a quiet room, instantly causing a stir. His face turned red with anger, frustration burning in his eyes.

"I can't believe a high school grad with no professional background could beat me so quickly. She must've gotten this internship through some shady connections. Who's to say she didn't get fifth place the same way?" His voice echoed through the conference room, making the tense atmosphere even worse.

Victoria's eyes welled up with tears as she felt both wronged and helpless.

She bit her lower lip, took a deep breath, and forced herself to calm down before speaking. "Irvin, yes, I was recommended for the internship, but I swear no one said a word for me during the assessment."

Wendy frowned, clearly annoyed with Irvin's behavior. She said, "Irvin, you can't just accuse others because you're upset. We've all seen how hard Victoria worked during her internship; she earned this."

The other interns started whispering among themselves. Some got where Irvin was coming from, given he was a top grad from the University of Aesthetics Shine and still got eliminated. Others thought he couldn't accept defeat gracefully. Questioning the fairness of the evaluation without any concrete evidence was really beneath him.

Frank looked at the chaotic scene, cleared his throat, and said firmly, "Everyone, quiet down. I want to stress again that this assessment was completely fair and just. We have strict standards and procedures, and every step was carefully evaluated. Victoria's results are because of her own efforts, and we don't play favorites."

"I don't buy it!" Irvin said, his voice trembling with emotion. "I've studied at a professional academy for years and worked my butt off; how could I be outdone by a college dropout?"

Diana shook her head and said, "Irvin, you need to face the facts. We all see how hard you work, but in art, a degree and experience aren't everything. If you keep making a scene, you'll just embarrass yourself even more."

Irvin's expression darkened even more, and he spat out angrily, "I'm not making a scene. I'm seeking justice!"

Diana frowned slightly, a hint of annoyance in her eyes. "Do you want me to be blunt? Your talent in art isn't as good as hers, got it?" she said.

Irvin was left speechless. As a student of the University of Aesthetics Shine, he knew that talent was everything in art. No matter how diligent and hardworking you were, you could never surpass a genius.

Diana's words felt like a slap in the face, making him feel ashamed and desperate to leave the awkward situation. He took a long look at Victoria, then turned and left the gallery.

Seeing this, Victoria breathed a sigh of relief, glad she managed to stay. Wendy stayed too, and the two, eager to celebrate their first victory in the internship competition, found a restaurant and excitedly talked about their upcoming plans.

Wendy was the first friend Victoria made after her family incident. Her old classmates and friends started avoiding her once they found out Alvin was behind the gym and bridge collapse.

When Victoria nervously told Wendy that Alvin was her dad, Wendy's reaction totally caught her off guard. Her eyes widened in surprise, then she sighed softly and patted Victoria's shoulder. "This is about your dad, but he's already been punished. You don't need to carry that burden."

Wendy's kind words made Victoria's eyes well up. She sniffled and nodded, her voice choked with emotion. "Thanks, Wendy."

Wendy shook her head with a smile and playfully pinched Victoria's cheek. "Come on, why the tears? After dinner, let's go shopping. We need a break."

Victoria didn't really want to buy anything, but she was happy to tag along with Wendy. Just as she was about to agree, her phone rang. It was Nora.

Victoria hesitated for a moment, then apologized to Wendy and stepped aside to take the call.

As soon as she picked up, Nora's shrill, grating voice came through. "Victoria, where the hell have you been? Have you forgotten I'm still in the hospital?"

Victoria hadn't forgotten, but she really didn't want to deal with Nora, who only seemed to see her as a cash machine.

She lowered her voice. "Mom, I've been busy with my new job. Besides, I've already paid this month's medical bills. Just focus on getting better."

Nora immediately snapped, "New job? Why did you change jobs? The Scott Group paid well. Does your new job pay as much?"

Victoria patiently replied, "It doesn't pay as much, but this job lets me learn more, and I really like it."

Nora was livid. "You only care about your own happiness? What about Bobby's tuition and my medical bills? Do you have any conscience?"

Victoria kept her voice calm. "Mom, please respect my choice. I have my own plans. I've already paid a month's medical bills. The doctor said you could've been discharged long ago, but you insisted on staying in the hospital because you think the care is better."

Nora retorted, "I have kidney failure, and you want me to recover at home? In your shabby rental? Do you want me to die there?"

Victoria pressed her lips together, silent for a moment, then softly said, "Mom, as long as you follow the doctor's advice and go to the hospital regularly for dialysis, you can live independently..."

Before Victoria could finish, Nora rudely interrupted, "Shut up! You just want me to die quickly so you can be free. I'm telling you, that's not going to happen!"

Victoria felt like her throat was filled with cotton, making it hard to breathe. She held back her emotions, trying to keep her voice steady. "Mom, I don't mean that. I just hope you can understand my difficulties. Staying in the hospital is too expensive, and the dialysis costs are increasing."

Victoria's tone was filled with obvious pleading and helplessness, which only made Nora more furious. Her voice shook through the phone. "Why didn't you sign the settlement agreement with Ella? She gave us a $200,000 deposit, and as soon as you sign the contract, the remaining $800,000 will be ours. I'm telling you, I'm not returning the money. Do you want me to go to jail like Alvin before you're satisfied?"

###chapter 24 Professor Brown's Class

Nora's words hit Victoria like a ton of bricks, and the tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over.

"Mom, how can you do this to me? You never care about the pain I've been through; all you care about is the money I bring home. Do whatever you want, but I'd rather die than make up with Ella. Figure it out yourself!" She slammed the phone down.

Just then, Wendy walked over, handed Victoria some tissues, and asked, "Victoria, what's wrong?"

Victoria wiped her tears and forced a smile. "Oh, it's nothing, just a little fight with my mom. I must look so silly."

Wendy put a comforting hand on her shoulder and said softly, "I don't think that at all. My family..."

Her voice trailed off, and she struggled to continue. "Just know I'm here for you. If you ever need anything, just ask."

Victoria was touched and said, "Thanks, Wendy."

Neither of them felt like shopping anymore, so after finishing their meal, they went their separate ways.

When Victoria got home, she found a letter at her door. It was a pass to the University of Aesthetics Shine sent by Samuel. Victoria was thrilled, and her earlier gloom lifted a bit.

Just then, Samuel texted her, saying there was a public lecture at the University of Aesthetics Shine the next morning and asked if she wanted to go. Of course, Victoria agreed right away.

The next morning, she got up early, got ready, and hurried to the University of Aesthetics Shine.

As she stepped onto the campus, it reminded her of the day she went to Imagination Realm University abroad last year, though she felt completely different now.

Imagination Realm University, renowned for its rich history and innovative teaching methods, had been a transformative experience for Victoria, even though she was there for less than half a year. The teachers encouraged students to experiment with various artistic styles and techniques.

When she had to leave because of family issues, the teachers and students didn't want her to go and even offered her a scholarship to stay. Despite her reluctance, Victoria couldn't ignore her family's needs, so she dropped out and went back home.

The University of Aesthetics Shine combined the elegance of traditional architecture with modern design. Its teaching philosophy emphasized preserving and innovating traditional culture while incorporating advanced international artistic ideas. It was on par with top schools abroad.

Victoria found a seat in a corner and overheard the girls in front of her chatting excitedly.

"Today is Professor Brown's public lecture. I've been looking forward to this for so long!" said a girl with glasses, her face lit up with excitement.

"Yeah, Professor Brown is the youngest professor here. I heard he comes from an artistic family, with both parents being famous artists. No wonder he's so talented," another short-haired girl chimed in.

"His works have won many awards both here and abroad. It's really impressive," a tall boy nodded in agreement.

"And he's super handsome! Every time he gives a lecture, the room is packed. Lots of girls come just to see him," the girl with glasses teased with a grin.

"Do you think the emerging artist Joshua could be Professor Brown? I heard one of his paintings can sell for tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars," the short-haired girl exclaimed, then shook her head. "No way. If Professor Brown were Joshua, why would he hide his identity? He could just sell his paintings under his own name. There's no need to be so secretive."

"Right!" The girl with glasses seemed to have an epiphany.

Just then, there was a sudden commotion on the stage.

"Professor Brown is here." The short-haired girl pointed excitedly at the steps, her eyes sparkling.

Victoria looked towards the steps and saw Samuel walking in casually.

Today, he was wearing a light gray shirt with black trousers and white casual shoes, looking both gentle and elegant, refined and dashing. His posture was upright, his features clear, and his every move exuded the elegance and composure of an artist.

He stood at the podium, his expression calm as he glanced around, a slight smile playing on his lips.

"Hello, everyone. I'm Samuel. Today, I'll be giving a brief talk on the expressiveness of painting." Samuel's steady and magnetic voice echoed in the classroom, making everyone quiet down.

He continued, "The expressiveness of painting refers to the artist's ability to convey their inner emotions, thoughts, and creativity to the audience through various painting elements and techniques. Can anyone give an example of how you can feel the expressiveness of a painting?"

A student raised their hand and answered, "I think color can do that. For example, a painting with bright colors might give a strong emotional impact."

Samuel smiled and nodded. "Very good. Does anyone else have a different perspective?"

Another student stood up and said, "I think the use of lines is also important. Different lines can convey different emotions. For instance, straight lines might give a sense of stability, while curves are softer and more dynamic."

Samuel looked at the students appreciatively and said, "You all have very good points. Now, let's think deeper about what other factors can enhance the expressiveness of a painting."

At this moment, Samuel's gaze swept toward the corner of the classroom and landed on Victoria. He said, "The girl in the corner, could you answer?"

Victoria had thought Samuel hadn't seen her, but now he was looking directly at her, waiting for her answer.

She quickly stood up, feeling a bit nervous yet excited, and answered, "I believe composition also greatly affects the expressiveness of a painting. A well-thought-out composition can guide the viewer's eye, highlight the focal points, and enhance the rhythm and harmony of the piece. The artist's brushwork can also convey different emotions and atmospheres."

After answering, Victoria nervously awaited Samuel's evaluation.

Samuel's smile widened slightly. "Excellent. Your answer is comprehensive and insightful." With that, he led the class in an enthusiastic round of applause for Victoria.

Victoria's face flushed, and she felt a sense of joy and pride she hadn't experienced in a long time.

For the rest of the lecture, Samuel explained in detail how to better use various techniques to express emotions.

Victoria listened intently, taking notes and occasionally asking questions. After the class ended, Victoria packed her things and was about to leave with the other students when Samuel called out to her, "Victoria, could you stay for a moment?"

###chapter 25 If You Can't Reconcile, Then Get Out

Feeling all kinds of awkward under her classmates' curious stares, Victoria shuffled over to Samuel and asked, "Professor Brown, did you need something from me?"

Samuel gave her a warm smile and asked, "So, how'd you feel about today's class?"

Victoria bit her lip, trying to steady her nerves. She looked up at Samuel and said earnestly, "I thought today's class was super helpful. I really got a better grasp on expressiveness and picked up a lot of practical skills."

"That's great," Samuel nodded, clearly pleased. "I've got another class at the same time next Sunday morning. Will you be there?"

Victoria's face lit up. "Yes, absolutely, I'll be there."

Samuel smiled back. "Alright then. See you next week."

"Thank you, Professor Brown," Victoria said gratefully before turning to leave.

As Samuel watched her go, a faint smile played on his lips, and there was a glint of amusement in his eyes.

Meanwhile, over at the swanky Garcia Villa, things were looking pretty grim.

Zachary Garcia, the head honcho of the Garcia family, was in his study dealing with business when his phone rang urgently. He frowned and answered the call. By the time it ended, his face was ashen.

He slammed the phone down on his desk, cursing, "Idiot!"

He got up and started pacing, his anger bubbling up. He couldn't believe Ella had done something so dumb. Sure, he knew she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but this was a new low.

Trying to keep his cool, Zachary called for the butler to bring Ella to the study.

Ella walked in, not even having a chance to ask what was up before Zachary slapped her hard, yelling, "You foolish girl!"

Ella's cheek burned, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. She clutched her stinging cheek, tears streaming down her face. "Dad, why did you hit me?" she asked.

Zachary roared, "How dare you question me? You useless waste! Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?"

"What did I do wrong?" Ella shot back, wiping her tears and glaring at Zachary.

Zachary snapped, "Playing dumb? The four guys you sent to mess with William's secretary got caught by the cops! They've already spilled the beans, and you still deny it?"

"That bitch actually called the cops?" Ella was stunned for a second, then scoffed, "So what if they got caught? William won't back her up. With the Garcia family's power, what do we have to fear from her?"

Zachary was livid. "The secretary isn't the issue. The female cop on her case, Luna, is from the Bailey family! The Baileys are a military family, and no matter how rich we are, we can't go up against them! She's not letting this go, and you're going to end up in jail!"

Hearing this, Ella shuddered. She suddenly realized how serious things were and ran to Zachary, crying and pleading, "Dad, I don't want to go to jail! Please help me!"

At that moment, Ella's mom, Willow Reed, rushed in, trying to calm Zachary down. "Zachary, Ella's young and didn't fully understand what she was doing. Please don't be too hard on her. We need to find a way to fix this!"

Seeing Willow plead for Ella only made Zachary angrier. "How dare you plead for her! If you hadn't spoiled her rotten, we wouldn't be in this mess! I should've let my mother raise her. Look at Alice, she is so sensible and accomplished from a young age. If it weren't for..."

He trailed off, remembering something, and after a sigh, continued, "If it weren't for that incident, how could I have let you replace Alice to marry William? You're the rightful future Mrs. Scott of the Scott family. Why even bother competing with a secretary? You've done it now, and you've been caught. That was incredibly foolish!"

Hearing Zachary mention Alice and constantly compare her, Ella felt deeply wronged and cried out, "Alice, it's always Alice. You've always thought I'm not as good as her. No matter what I do, you're never satisfied. She deserved..."

Before she could finish, Zachary raised his hand to strike her again.

Willow quickly stepped in to stop him. "Zachary, Ella is still young. Don't blame her. Let's talk this through calmly!"

Zachary, veins bulging on his forehead in anger, pointed at Ella and Willow with a trembling hand, shouting in disappointment, "How could I have such a foolish daughter! You two figure it out yourselves. If you can't get Victoria to settle, then get out of the Garcia family. I don't have a daughter like you!"

With that, he shook off Willow's grip and stormed out, leaving Ella trembling with anger.

Ella glared at his departing figure, seething with hatred.

Willow hurriedly checked Ella's face, tenderly applying medicine to her injury while scolding, "He hit you too hard. Look, your face is swollen."

Ella pouted and cried in Willow's arms. "He only favors Alice. He doesn't care about me at all. In his eyes, I'm just dirt under Alice's feet, not worth anything. When I get into trouble, he only blames me for disgracing the Garcia family and doesn't care whether I live or die!"

Hearing this, Willow patted Ella's shoulder, comforting her. "Don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you. As for Victoria, she's just a powerless woman who got ahead by selling herself. I'll make her pay for it."

Ella's eyes lit up at Willow's words, and she smiled through her tears. "Mom, what should we do?" she asked.

Willow smirked coldly and replied, "Get her to meet us. I'll make sure she signs the settlement agreement and teach her a lesson."

Ella was initially delighted but then shook her head. "That bitch is very cunning. She won't come out easily."

Willow smiled slyly and said, "Didn't you give her mom two hundred thousand dollars? Have her mom trick her into coming out."

Hearing Willow's idea, Ella clapped her hands in approval.

###chapter 26 Give Her Just Enough Water to Keep Her Alive

Victoria was at home, sorting through her notes, when her phone buzzed with a call from Nora. She tried to ignore it and kept writing, but Nora was persistent.

With a sigh, Victoria finally picked up. "Mom, what now?" she asked, not hiding her annoyance.

Nora's voice was shaky and urgent. "Victoria, you have to help Bobby! He got into a fight and hurt someone badly. They want five grand, or they'll call the cops. I don't know what else to do. Please, go check on him."

Victoria rolled her eyes. "Mom, didn't I give you all my money? Why don't you use that?"

Nora hesitated, then said, "I'm on dialysis and can't go. I'll transfer the money to you, and you can handle it, okay?"

Despite her frustration, Victoria couldn't ignore her mom's plea. "Fine, I'll go," she said.

After hanging up, she changed clothes and headed to the address Nora gave her. When she got there, it was an old, run-down factory with peeling paint and weeds everywhere.

Victoria paused at the entrance, unsure if she should go in. She tried calling Bobby, but his line was busy. Feeling uneasy, she was about to leave when the door swung open. A group of bodyguards surrounded her. One of them said, "Come with us."

Victoria's heart sank, and she felt a wave of panic. She couldn't believe Nora would put her in danger like this for money! Taking a deep breath, Victoria looked around, hoping for an escape route. But the bodyguards blocked every exit. She had no choice but to follow them inside.

Inside, Ella and Willow stood out in their fancy suits against the shabby backdrop. Ella's smile was twisted with malice as she saw Victoria being pushed in.

"You must be Victoria," Willow said, looking her up and down. "No wonder you managed to get William with that face."

Victoria ignored her, focusing on Ella, who was lounging in a chair. "Did you go through all this just to humiliate me?" she asked.

Ella smirked. "Who's humiliating you? My mom's just telling it like it is. Don't think you can climb up by clinging to William. Have you seen yourself? Just sign the settlement, or I'll make sure you regret it."

Victoria, fed up with Ella's attitude, shot back, "I don't care if William likes me or not. I won't settle even if you kill me. Do you think Luna won't find out?"

Ella's face twisted with rage. "Shut up, you bitch!" she screamed.

Victoria smirked, taunting, "The fearless Ms. Garcia, scared of something?"

"Stop trying to scare me!" Ella snapped, trying to sound tough, but her voice wavered.

Sensing Ella be at a disadvantage, Willow stepped up and slapped Victoria hard. "You're really pushing it now! You're just a whore who'd sell anything for money. How much do you want to settle? A million? Three million?"

Held back by the bodyguards, Victoria couldn't retaliate. She sneered, "Sure, I'll settle. Give me three hundred million dollars, and I might consider it."

Willow's face flushed with anger, and she slapped Victoria again. "Three hundred million? You're out of your mind!"

Wiping the blood from her mouth, Victoria said calmly, "Then there's nothing more to discuss."

"Bitch!" Willow's face turned red with rage. She wanted to strangle Victoria but feared Luna's retaliation. She had to hold back her anger and play her trump card.

She pulled some photos from her bag and shoved them at Victoria. "Let's see if you can still act tough after seeing these."

Victoria took the photos, her face gradually turning pale, her pupils dilating, and her fingers trembling.

Seeing Victoria's reaction, Ella was delighted. "Get a good look? Want me to have a few more taken for you?"

Victoria gripped the photos tightly, her knuckles turning white, unaware of her nails digging into her flesh. The photos showed Alvin, beaten and bruised in prison, his face swollen and body covered in injuries. Seeing this, Victoria felt suffocated, her eyes red and tears welling up.

Nora had always favored Bobby, but despite his busy work schedule, Alvin had always been kind and loving to Victoria. And now, because of Victoria, Alvin was suffering!

Victoria suddenly looked up, her eyes bloodshot, and screamed, "Ella! Do you have any humanity left?"

"Humanity? In this world of the strong devouring the weak, only the strong have the right to talk about humanity!" Ella laughed maniacally and continued, "He deserves it! If he wants to blame someone, blame him for his bad luck, having a daughter like you!"

Willow chimed in, "Victoria, if you remain stubborn, I'll have to let people take care of him more!"

Victoria's breath hitched, her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the ground, sobbing uncontrollably, her tears soaking her cheeks.

Seeing her like this, Ella felt a surge of satisfaction and said arrogantly, "Victoria, I'll give you one last chance. Agree to settle and never bother William again, or else..."

Victoria looked up at Ella, hatred in her eyes, "Bring the settlement agreement, I'll sign it. But if you harm my dad again, I'll fight you to the end! My life may be cheap, but I'll drag you down with me!"

"You!" Ella raised her hand to slap her again but was stopped by Willow. She said, "Ella, let her sign the agreement first."

Victoria took the settlement agreement from Ella and signed it forcefully, pressing her fingerprint beside her signature.

Seeing this, Ella nodded in satisfaction and ordered the bodyguards, "Take her phone and lock her in the basement for five days. Give her just enough water to keep her alive."

###chapter 27 Pull Herself Together to Plan Her Escape

The bodyguard took the order and left. Ella shot Victoria a smug look and sneered, "Let's see how you continue to be arrogant now, bitch!"

Victoria knew fighting back would only make things worse, so she let them take her bag and phone. They shoved her into the basement of an old, abandoned factory, tossed a bottle of water at her, and locked the door behind them.

The basement was damp and dark, with walls covered in mold and a sickening smell of decay. A faint light trickled in from a high-up ventilation window.

In the eerie silence, the occasional rustling sounds around made even someone as tough as Victoria feel a chill down her spine.

She slowly slid down the wall, hugging her knees, trying to calm herself and figure out a way to escape. Then, a weird-looking bug, about the size of half her palm and glowing a strange green, crawled toward her. Her eyes widened in horror, and she let out a scream.

The natural fear of bugs made her scoot back into a corner until she had nowhere else to go.

As the bug got closer, Victoria summoned her courage and stomped on it hard. It squished instantly, splattering a foul-smelling, sticky goo.

Victoria looked at the disgusting mess on her shoe, and her stomach churned. She dry-heaved a few times, almost throwing up.

Finally, the tears she had been holding back spilled over, streaming down her face. She cried and cried, then suddenly laughed. Wiping away her tears, she started to pull herself together and plan her escape.

She felt along the wall, hoping to find a crack or something to grip, but it was too smooth. She searched the ground, hoping to find something useful. Instead, she found a few sharp stones that cut her fingers, making them bleed and sting.

She quickly wrapped her hand with a piece of her clothing and kept looking for a way out. But even after the sun had set, she hadn't found a clue.

Complete darkness swallowed the basement, like an endless black hole, terrifying and deep. Even though Victoria wasn't claustrophobic, she felt anxious and uneasy in that environment.

She stood still, trying to ignore the creepy sounds of insects and dripping water. She tried to control her trembling arms, then found a corner to sit down and hugged herself tightly.

"Will anyone come to save me?" Victoria muttered with a bitter smile, clinging to a sliver of hope.

What if Nora got the money and, out of guilt, called Victoria? If Nora couldn't reach her, would she worry and come looking for her? But deep down, Victoria knew it was just wishful thinking. Nora would never care about her life or death.

Nora was probably celebrating with Bobby, spending the money she got from betraying Victoria. Thinking of this, Victoria couldn't help but lower her eyes and smile bitterly.

Alvin was right; she shouldn't have cared about them anymore. Her indecisiveness had led to this situation, and she deserved to be here, suffering.

But besides Nora, who else could possibly come to save her? As soon as this thought crossed her mind, William's image flashed before her eyes. What if he was willing to help her? But she quickly dismissed the thought.

Victoria bit her lip, shaking her head, forcing herself not to fantasize about such a possibility. William despised her, so why would he help her?

Thinking of this, Victoria hugged herself even tighter, trying to sleep to conserve energy; otherwise, she wouldn't be able to think of a way out tomorrow.

Late at night, William was still grinding away in his office. Harry knocked and stepped in to remind him about dinner. "Mr. Scott, your dinner's ready."

William barely glanced up. "You can have it."

Harry hesitated, then asked, "Are you working on the Starry Studio Gallery deal?"

Only something big like that would keep William working this late. William's eyes locked onto Harry, sharp and intense. "Got a lot of extra energy, do you? Since when is it your place to question my business?"

Harry gulped and quickly backed off. "Sorry, Mr. Scott. I'll leave you to it."

William went back to the contract.

Hugo Simpson, that sly fox, knew William was desperate to get Starry Studio Gallery and jacked up the price, making him pay a premium for just 45% of the shares. But Hugo still held the management rights.

Normally, William would never sign such a bad deal. But now, he didn't care. Did Victoria think she could get away from him? Not a chance. He had to keep her close and make her suffer. The thought made him sneer.

The next morning, Victoria woke up starving. She hadn't eaten since yesterday morning, and her stomach was growling.

She took a small sip of the mineral water, struggled to sit up from the cold floor, and staggered to the door, leaning against the wall. It was an iron gate, thick as a thumb, welded shut with heavy steel bars, solid and unmovable.

Victoria tried pulling it a few times, but not only did it not budge, but her wrists ached from the effort.

Not ready to give up, she turned to the ventilation window. If she could break it and climb up, she could escape. She picked up a small stone and threw it at the window with all her might.

After several tries, she finally broke the glass. The shards fell, almost cutting her. Looking at them on the ground, she got an idea.

She tore a piece of cloth from her sleeve, wrapped it around the glass, and used it to dig into the wall, trying to make some holes to climb up to the window.

It was a clumsy method, but better than waiting to die in this awful place. Victoria kept at it, digging into the wall.

Even with the cloth, her palm got cut by the glass shards, but she didn't give up. She tore more cloth to wrap around her hand and kept digging.

Victoria, standing at 5'6", could reach up to 6'5" with her hands raised. From day to night, enduring hunger and exhaustion, she worked tirelessly until four or five in the morning, finally making a few holes. She collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath.

Next, she needed to tear her coat into strips, tie them around a rock, and toss it onto the window to wedge it open. Then she could climb up and through the hole onto the windowsill.

Feeling a surge of hope, Victoria got to work. She made a rope out of her clothes and, after much effort, secured the stone on the window frame.

Luckily, she was slim; otherwise, the window frame would have broken immediately.

Victoria tugged on the rope, finding it stable enough, and slowly climbed up using the holes. As she neared the window, joy filled her heart, and she climbed even harder.

But just as she was about to reach the window, the makeshift rope snapped, and she lost her balance and fell backward.

With a dull thud, she hit the ground hard. Her waist struck the floor, sending waves of intense pain through her body, and she blacked out instantly.

###chapter 28 My Patience is Limited

On Monday morning, Wendy brought some of her favorite breakfast goodies to share with Victoria.

She waited at the Starry Studio Gallery, but even after work hours had passed, there was still no sign of Victoria.

Wendy shot Victoria a message, but got no reply, and her calls went straight to voicemail. She started to get worried. Victoria was never late, let alone disappear without a trace.

Could Victoria be sick?

Since Victoria got her internship through some internal connections, Wendy figured Diana must know Victoria's friends. So she rushed to Diana's office and anxiously asked, "Ms. Simpson, did Victoria take a leave of absence?"

"She didn't come?" Diana asked, her expression shifting slightly.

Victoria hadn't asked for leave from Diana. She was always hardworking and would never skip work without a reason. Could something have happened to her?

Thinking of this, Diana told Wendy to go back to work and then called Elara to ask about the situation.

Elara also thought Victoria might be sick and quickly took out a spare key to check on her, only to find that she wasn't home. After making numerous unanswered calls, Elara quickly informed Diana that Victoria might be missing and asked Diana to think of a solution.

Diana's face darkened as she thought of William, who had recently spent a lot of money to acquire their gallery. She had heard from Elara that Victoria used to work at the Scott Group.

Now that Victoria was missing, even if it wasn't William's doing, he was definitely involved. Although Diana didn't know what kind of entanglement they had, Victoria was now part of Starry Studio Gallery, and Diana wouldn't allow anyone to harm her.

Since William had spent a lot of money to acquire 45% of Starry Studio Gallery's shares, he shouldn't harm Victoria anymore.

After some thought, Diana dialed William's number. When his phone rang, William saw it was an unfamiliar number. He frowned and answered, just about to ask who it was when Diana's slightly cold voice came through, "Mr. Scott, hello, it's Diana Simpson."

William thought, 'Diana? Hugo's daughter, the general manager of Starry Studio Gallery. Why would Diana be calling me?'

"Ms. Simpson, what can I do for you?" he asked indifferently.

Diana asked, "Mr. Scott, do you know Victoria? She used to work at your company."

When William heard her words, his expression froze slightly. Diana was really smart, quickly guessing that he had acquired shares in Starry Studio Gallery because of Victoria. As expected of cunning Hugo's daughter from the Simpson family.

Thinking of this, William cleared his throat and replied indifferently, "Yes, I know her."

"Since you know her, I'll get straight to the point. She's missing. It wasn't you, was it?" Diana's voice sounded a bit agitated.

"She's missing?" William's voice suddenly rose a few notches.

Diana paused for a second, then recounted what had happened that morning, finally saying, "If you could help me find her, I would be very grateful." Then she hung up the phone.

William stared at the darkened screen for a moment, then stood up and shouted, "Harry, get in here!"

In no time, Harry entered the room and respectfully said, "Mr. Scott."

"Find out where Victoria is," William ordered with a stern face.

Harry's heart skipped a beat when he heard this. Victoria was missing?

"Got it," he said and prepared to leave.

"Wait," William suddenly called out. "Don't forget to check on Ella's whereabouts as well," he added.

"Okay," Harry said and immediately left.

William leaned back in his chair, his eyes deep. The only sign of his emotions was the tightly clenched pen in his hand. Soon, Harry discovered that Victoria's last call was from Nora. After that, Victoria's phone lost signal.

A shadow crossed William's eyes, and he immediately headed to Nora's hospital room with his men.

Nora was happily talking to Bobby on the phone, smiling as she said, "Ella kept her word. As soon as Victoria signed, the remaining $800,000 was transferred! Bobby, I'll send you the money right away and give you an extra $50,000 for spending money!"

"Really? That's great! Now I can definitely get into the University of Aesthetics Shine!" Bobby said excitedly.

Nora sighed and said, "It's all Victoria's fault. If she had signed earlier, your matter wouldn't have been delayed for so long."

"Exactly, my classmates have already started training for a week. I have to go pay the fees now!" Bobby said eagerly and hung up the phone.

Nora put away her phone, a satisfied expression on her face. Just as she was about to ask the caregiver for a glass of water, the door was kicked open.

Nora was startled and turned to see a group of men storming in. Just as she was about to question them, William stepped forward, his deep voice cutting through the silence. "Victoria is missing. Does it have anything to do with you?"

Nora's eyes widened in panic, and she exclaimed, "Who are you? What right do you have to meddle in our family affairs?"

William's gaze was as sharp as an ice blade as he looked at Nora. He said, "You'd better tell me everything honestly, or don't blame me for being rude!"

Hearing this, Nora couldn't help but shiver. She had never seen such a fierce look before; it was terrifying.

"I don't know. She's my daughter. Why would I harm her?" she insisted through gritted teeth.

William sneered, his tone full of sarcasm. "I only believe in evidence!" With that, William turned to Harry and gave him a look. Harry understood and stepped forward, pinning Nora against the wall.

"What are you doing? Help! Murder!" Nora screamed at the top of her lungs.

"Shut up! If you keep yelling, I'll cut out your tongue!" Harry threatened viciously.

"You dare! Let me go! I warn you..." Before Nora could finish, a slap landed on Nora's cheek, leaving a bright red handprint. Her smooth skin immediately swelled with the imprint of the palm, looking quite shocking.

"I advise you not to shout. My patience is limited," William said expressionlessly.

Nora's body trembled, and she slowly stopped struggling, stammering. "I don't know why she's missing. I just sent her to a place."

"Where?" William pressed.

Nora then gave William the address of the abandoned factory, not forgetting to add, "This has nothing to do with me! It was Ella who did it. She kidnapped Victoria."

William's eyes flickered. He snorted coldly and then, along with his men, drove to the abandoned factory.

A dozen bodyguards searched the entire factory and finally found Victoria in the basement. Pushing open the iron gate, William saw Victoria lying on the ground, covered in blood, her lips purple, looking lifeless.

His pupils contracted, and his heart seemed to be hollowed out in an instant, the pain unbearable.

He squatted down to check Victoria's breathing, then placed his hand on her chest. Only when he felt her heartbeat did his own heart gradually begin to calm. He picked up Victoria and rushed out of the dilapidated building, with Harry and several bodyguards quickly following.

###chapter 29 Teach Her a Lesson

"Get her to the hospital," William barked as he rushed Victoria to the car.

Harry whipped out his phone and dialed the hospital.

The car zoomed down the road, and William stayed quiet, eyes down. He looked at Victoria, pale and lifeless in his arms, her face white as a ghost, with dark red bloodstains still visible on her body. It was a shocking sight.

A thin mist clouded William's brows, and his deep eyes seemed to gather the storm clouds of an impending tempest. Blood started seeping from Victoria's wounds again, soaking William's expensive, tailored suit jacket.

When they got to the hospital, Victoria was rushed into the emergency room. William stayed outside, his gaze fixed on the glowing sign above the operating room doors.

Harry, seeing the situation, didn't say a word, just standing by William silently.

After a long while, William suddenly turned to Harry and said coldly, "Ella's getting out of hand. Teach her a lesson."

William thought to himself, 'I didn't want to punish Ella for Victoria's sake; I just thought she was too disobedient. If she becomes my wife, she'll be even more unruly! The Scott family's daughter-in-law doesn't need to be particularly clever, but she absolutely cannot defy me.'

Harry got the message and replied respectfully, "Got it, Mr. Scott."

After nearly three hours of resuscitation, Victoria was moved to the ICU, still in a deep coma.

William hurriedly asked the doctor about Victoria's condition.

"The patient's internal injuries are severe. Although she's out of immediate danger, she won't wake up until tomorrow at the earliest. Plus, her back injury is quite serious. Whether there will be any long-term effects depends on her recovery. In severe cases, she might even be paralyzed," Dr. Parker, who had treated Victoria several times, said with a frown.

William's face instantly turned dark and terrifying. He said, "I won't allow that to happen!"

"Mr. Scott, getting angry at me won't help!" Dr. Parker adjusted his glasses, looking a bit helpless.

He thought, 'Has William Scott read too many novels and lost his mind? If he really cared so much, where was he earlier? Victoria had been to the hospital several times in the past few months, each time more serious than the last. Now he wants to act all affectionate?'

William, hearing this, slightly furrowed his brows and then said, "Treat her, no matter the cost!"

Dr. Parker rather liked this statement. After all, in this day and age, there were very few illnesses that money couldn't cure.

So Dr. Parker agreed and immediately called to have a batch of special medicines airlifted from an affiliated hospital abroad to give Victoria the best treatment.

Wendy and Diana, upon learning that Victoria had been found, rushed to the hospital even though it was already midnight.

As soon as they entered the ward, Wendy rushed up and anxiously asked Dr. Parker, "Where is Victoria? How is she?"

Dr. Parker removed his mask and glanced at the two, saying, "She's temporarily out of danger, but she still needs to be hospitalized for observation."

Hearing this, Wendy and Diana breathed a sigh of relief, then noticed William, who was standing nearby with broad shoulders and a distinguished demeanor.

Wendy curiously looked him over, thinking that William was really handsome! Although Diana had never met William, she immediately guessed who he was.

She stepped forward and introduced herself, "Mr. Scott, hello, I'm Diana from Starry Studio Gallery. We spoke on the phone today."

However, William responded indifferently, then fixed his deep gaze on Victoria lying in the hospital bed.

Diana ignored his indifference. As Victoria's boss, she felt it was her responsibility to inquire about her condition. "I need to know how Victoria went missing and why she's so badly hurt," Diana said.

William pressed his lips together, his handsome face showing no emotion. "I'll explain it to her," he replied.

Diana smiled and said, "Alright then, Mr. Scott. We'll be going now."

William nodded and waved his hand, signaling they could leave.

Back at the Garcia Villa, Harry, along with a bunch of bodyguards, found Zachary.

He relayed William's message about taking Ella on a little trip down memory lane. Zachary, who was about to hit the sack, knew right away that Willow and Ella must have done something stupid again.

He glared at the two angrily. Ella, hiding in Willow's arms, didn't get why William was making such a big deal out of this. Wasn't it just locking Victoria up for a couple of days?

When she heard from her bodyguard that Victoria had been taken away by William, Ella didn't care. She'd done worse things before, and William had never stood up for any woman.

It wasn't until she saw William's head bodyguard, Harry, a former special forces captain, leading a large team to the Garcia Villa to "escort" her, that she realized she might have really pissed William off this time.

Terrified, she hid behind Willow and cried, "Mom, William must be angry. What should I do?"

Hearing Ella's cries, Willow panicked. She soothingly patted Ella's head and then looked up at Harry. "Sir, what do you mean by this?" she asked.

"Mr. Scott just wants to take Ms. Garcia somewhere. She'll be back safe in two days," Harry calmly explained.

"What if I refuse?" Willow snorted coldly, clearly not accepting it.

"Mr. Scott said that if Ms. Garcia doesn't go, the engagement between the Scott family and the Garcia family will be called off, and all joint projects will be terminated immediately," Harry said calmly, but with a hint of threat.

Willow's face turned livid with anger. "You dare threaten me!" she shouted.

"Mrs. Garcia, you misunderstand. I'm just doing my duty. Mr. Scott said that if you insist on not letting Ms. Garcia go, we will have to force our way in," Harry said expressionlessly.

"You are too presumptuous!" Willow pointed at Harry angrily.

"Enough!" Zachary shouted coldly. He then stood up and walked towards Harry, saying, "Since Mr. Scott has extended such a gracious invitation, I must show him this respect. However, I hope Mr. Scott keeps his promise and returns Ella safely in two days."

Harry nodded. "Mr. Garcia, rest assured. Mr. Scott never breaks his promises."

Sensing Zachary about to hand her over to Harry, Ella cried out, "Dad, are you really going to let me suffer? I may not be as important as Alice in your heart, but I'm still your daughter, right? How can you be so heartless!"

Hearing this, Zachary stopped, turned around, and sternly scolded, "Shut up! Haven't you caused enough trouble? If it weren't for your stupidity, how would things have come to this? Besides, William said he wouldn't harm you. Do you really want to break off the engagement and become the laughingstock of Silvermist City?"

Zachary didn't know what Ella and Willow had done this time, but seeing William's reaction, he knew William was truly angry. If they lost their connection with the Scott family through marriage, the Garcia family would suffer greatly.

In comparison, letting Ella take some punishment was nothing. Maybe she would learn to behave and cause less trouble in the future.

Hearing this, Ella fell silent. She was afraid of suffering, but she was even more afraid of losing William.

On one hand, she genuinely liked him; on the other, the title of William's fiancée brought her too much vanity and satisfaction. She couldn't bear to lose it.

But she soon regretted it when Harry took her to the basement where Victoria had been held, threw her inside, and locked the iron door.

###chapter 30 Please Let Me Go

Staring at the pitch-black, stinky cage, Ella screamed her lungs out, banging on the iron door. "Help! I can't stay in here, let me out!"

Harry just looked at her, cold as ice. "Mr. Scott said you need to feel this too, so you'll understand what it means to be restrained." And with that, he walked away without a second glance.

Ella shook the iron door, but it was useless. She was scared out of her mind, curling up on the damp, cold ground, shaking like a leaf.

Ella felt something crawling up her leg and freaked out, screaming and pounding on the door with both hands. "Help! Somebody save me!"

Meanwhile, Victoria had been out cold in the hospital bed for a whole day and night before she finally woke up. When she opened her eyes, all she saw was white, and her left hand was hooked up to an IV.

The last thing she remembered was falling from the ventilation window. Did someone save her?

"Awake?" A familiar male voice broke the silence.

Victoria looked up and saw William sitting in a chair by the bed, his brows furrowed as he stared at her with a complicated look. He looked tired, like he hadn't slept in ages.

"William?" Victoria called softly. "Did you save me?" she asked.

William's expression softened a bit. "How are you feeling?" he asked.

"I'm okay." Victoria forced a small smile. "Thank you."

William frowned but didn't say anything. He hadn't seen Victoria talk to him so calmly in a long time, but it made him feel weirdly irritated.

After a long silence, he finally spoke in a low voice, "If you want to thank someone, thank Diana and your friend Wendy. They were the ones who noticed you were missing. They've come to see you several times in the past two days, but you were out cold."

"Okay, I'll thank them." Victoria looked down and responded quietly. Then she asked, "Did the doctor say when I can leave?"

"You need to stay for at least a week, or you'll have lasting issues with your back," William replied.

Victoria just nodded and didn't say anything else. An awkward silence filled the room. After a while, Victoria looked up and said to William, "Mr. Scott, you know who locked me in the basement, right?"

William pressed his lips together, his eyes darkening.

Victoria didn't expect him to answer and continued, "It was Ella. Even though I've signed a settlement agreement with her, she still won't let me go. You know why."

Hearing this, William nodded slightly.

"Ella is spoiled and has a bad temper. She's irritable, narrow-minded, and willful, but one thing is certain: she likes you a lot..." Victoria paused slightly.

"To be more precise, she admires you a lot. Love brings worry, love brings fear. She hates the women around you, especially someone like me, with whom you have an improper relationship." Victoria spoke calmly, like she was talking about the weather, but her tone made William's muscles tense up.

"As a woman, I can understand her feelings. But I've been hurt by her repeatedly, and I feel very wronged and angry. However, all of this, in the end, is thanks to you." Victoria looked at William, a sarcastic smile on her lips.

"Mr. Scott, please, for the sake of me almost losing my life several times, let me go, okay?" she said in the calmest tone.

William's pupils trembled violently for a moment, then he suddenly grabbed Victoria's shoulder with such force it seemed he wanted to crush her bones.

He stared into Victoria's eyes, as if trying to see through her. "Do you hate me that much?" he asked.

"No," Victoria denied softly, her face still cold and emotionless. "If it weren't for you, Nora wouldn't get hospital treatment, and Bobby wouldn't continue his studies. I have no right to hate you. I'm just scared, do you understand? I can sell myself for money, but it's not worth risking my life for it."

William was stunned, his eyes locked on her, sharp and intense. He wanted to see through her pale, tired face to understand her true thoughts.

Victoria looked back calmly and coldly. As their eyes met, the atmosphere grew strange and tense.

William could clearly see his reflection in her eyes that showed no emotion, no hatred, no anger-just a plain look, as if he were an ordinary acquaintance.

What she said just now was her true feelings; she really didn't want to be involved with him anymore. Realizing this, William felt a surge of nameless anger, but he quickly regained control over his emotions.

In the end, William released Victoria, his deep eyes shadowed with a somber look. His thin lips parted slightly as he said, "You should rest." With that, he strode out and closed the door behind him without looking back.

As soon as William left, Victoria's heart pounded wildly. William's gaze just now was terrifying, like a beast ready to pounce and devour her. It took a lot of effort for her to appear somewhat calm.

She had made herself very clear just now. She thought, 'William, being the proud man he is and always surrounded by beautiful women, surely wouldn't trouble her again, right?'

When Victoria fell from the windowsill, she really felt like she was going to die. She used to think it didn't matter if she lived or died; living was just painful.

But now, seeing a big chance to stay at Starry Studio Gallery, even as an auditor, she could re-enter the university campus to continue studying painting.

She hadn't felt this sense of purpose and drive in a long time.

It was like going back to the years when she worked hard to get into her dream university, so full of energy and hope, unlike before when she was barely alive and filled with a faint sense of death.

She was tired of the constant cycle of getting injured and ending up in the hospital. Now, she just wanted to do her best to stay at Starry Studio Gallery and, hopefully, go back to university to continue her studies.

If she could pay off Alvin's debt early and bring him out, that would be even better.

While she was lost in thought, her phone rang.

She took out her phone and saw it was a call from Samuel.

She quickly pressed the answer button and asked, "Professor Brown, is there something you need?"

Samuel's deep laughter came through the phone. "Can't I call you just because?"

Hearing this, Victoria was slightly stunned. Then she shook her head and said, "Of course you can. I was just worried you had something urgent."

"I don't have anything urgent, just wanted to tell you that the public class on Sunday has been moved to Saturday afternoon. Can you attend?" Samuel's tone was gentle, with a hint of inquiry.

Victoria was stunned, looking at her hand still connected to the IV, and replied helplessly, "I can't make it this time."

Although she really wanted to attend, she knew which was more important-a single class or a lifetime of consequences.

There was a brief pause on the other end of the line before the voice slowly resumed, "May I ask the reason why?"

"I have something to do that day." Victoria didn't want him to know she was in the hospital and tried to brush it off.

However, at that moment, the door opened.

A nurse walked in with medication and a syringe. "Victoria, right? It's time to change your medication!"

Even though Victoria covered the phone immediately, Samuel still heard the nurse's voice, and his tone became serious. "Are you in the hospital?"

###chapter 31 Rest and Recover

Victoria hesitated for a sec but then came clean, "Yeah."

"Which hospital?" Samuel pressed.

After a brief pause, Victoria answered, "Dawn Healthcare Center."

Samuel was quiet for a moment before saying, "Wait for me."

"Professor Brown! You don't have to..." Victoria started, but Samuel had already hung up. She sighed and put her phone away.

Half an hour later, Samuel showed up at the hospital room door, rocking a dark gray suit and gold-rimmed glasses. He had a bouquet of lilies, a fruit basket, and a few books in hand.

Victoria had never seen him with glasses before, and now he looked like a whole different person. Gone was the casual, charming guy from art shows and lectures. With glasses, he seemed more refined and intellectual, giving off a mature vibe that made Victoria feel at ease.

"Professor Brown, you really didn't have to go through all this trouble," Victoria said politely.

Samuel set the fruit on the table, then sat on the edge of her bed. "Why so formal? Aren't we friends?"

Victoria smiled and nodded.

Seeing her pale face, Samuel frowned. "What happened to you?"

Victoria looked down, biting her lip. "I just had a fall."

Samuel could tell she didn't want to get into it, so he let it go. "What did the doctor say? Is it serious?"

"The doctor said I just need to rest for a few days. I can go home by the weekend," Victoria replied.

"That's good." Samuel's expression softened. "I brought you some new books. Thought you might like them."

"Thanks, Professor Brown," Victoria said with a smile.

Samuel chuckled. "Just call me Samuel from now on."

Victoria hesitated but then nodded.

Samuel laughed. He handed her a book titled "Art and Visual Perception" and started explaining some key points. "This book dives into how we see and create art..."

Victoria listened closely as Samuel explained. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a peaceful glow over them. When the nurse came to ask visitors to leave, Samuel reluctantly stood up. "Get some rest. I'll visit again when I can."

Victoria smiled as she watched him leave. Once the room was quiet again, she picked up the book and started reading.

Later, Wendy and Diana showed up with fruit and flowers. Wendy rushed over and hugged Victoria, tears streaming down her face.

"Victoria, you're finally awake! I was so worried," Wendy cried.

Victoria felt a lump in her throat. "Thank you, Wendy. If you hadn't noticed I was missing, who knows what would've happened!"

Wendy wiped her tears and scolded, "Don't say thank you; we are friends."

Victoria smiled.

Diana added, "Just focus on getting better. We'll deal with the assessment later. No need to stress."

Victoria nodded. "Thank you, Ms. Simpson."

She had been worried about it and was planning to call Diana, but seeing her at the hospital made her feel a bit overwhelmed.

Wendy ordered some light meals, and they had lunch together in the hospital room before reluctantly leaving.

Meanwhile, William stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window at the Scott Group, lost in thought as memories flashed through his mind like a slideshow. A flood of emotions hit him: the grief from his parents' death a decade ago, the comfort from his aunt Daisy Scott and uncle Wayne Scott promising to find the culprit.

He also remembered Victoria nervously applying for a receptionist job at the Scott Group, and how he instantly recognized her as Alvin's daughter. He recalled Victoria fainting when Alvin was arrested and later accepting a humiliating agreement.

The last image in his mind was Victoria's eyes, filled with emotion. Now, Victoria lay in a hospital bed, hoping to have nothing more to do with William. But that was impossible.

Unless William could shake off his nightmares and the torment of the past. Otherwise, Victoria would be stuck with him until the end.

As William was deep in thought, the office door swung open, and Harry walked in. "Mr. Scott, Ella has been sent back to the Garcia Villa."

William glanced at him and asked casually, "How is she?"

Harry described Ella's miserable condition. She had been locked in the basement for two days, enduring the cold, damp darkness, insects crawling around her, and unbearable hunger.

More importantly, William had Harry block all the windows, so Ella couldn't see any light and had no idea how much time had passed or how long she'd be kept there. This psychological torment was worse than physical pain.

"When Ms. Garcia was released, she had lost a lot of weight, her cheeks were sunken, her skin was dull, and she was covered in red marks from insect bites. She seemed to have a fever," Harry reported.

William was silent for a moment, then asked indifferently, "She didn't cause any trouble, did she?"

"No," Harry replied.

William's eyes showed a hint of mockery. "I hope she learns her lesson this time. If it weren't for..." He didn't finish his sentence, just snorted and went back to work.

Victoria stayed at Dawn Healthcare Center for a few more days, during which Samuel visited her several times to explain some challenging points from the books.

With his help, Victoria felt enlightened. She had inherited her artistic talent from her parents and had always loved and worked hard at learning art, so her skills were pretty solid.

Now, with Samuel's guidance, many problems that had troubled her for a long time were resolved.

After being discharged, Victoria returned to her job. Although she had missed a week of training, Wendy sent her daily training points, and with Samuel's professional guidance, she didn't fall behind much.

Once she started working again, she quickly caught up.

The remaining five interns not only helped adjust the gallery and introduce products to customers but also learned to acquire artworks at reasonable prices, especially those of popular artists.

Securing works by popular artists was crucial for the Starry Studio Gallery. It could enhance the gallery's reputation and influence, attracting more visitors and collectors. Especially now, Joshua's works were highly sought after globally.

The piece Victoria saw when she first arrived at the gallery had sold for a million dollars in the first week. So the interns who managed to get hold of Joshua's work had the best chance of staying on.

However, Joshua was very mysterious. He only sold three or four pieces a year, all through his manager, never appearing in public. So getting his work was very difficult.

Wendy and the other three interns either used family connections to get works by foreign masters or found many new artists' works, hoping to win by quantity.

But Victoria wanted to try to get Joshua's work to increase her chances of staying. So she called Samuel, "Professor Brown, you're a professor at the University of Aesthetics Shine. Can you help me find out about Mr. Thomas?"

Samuel was stunned for a moment, then asked, "You want to acquire his work for your gallery?"

###chapter 32 Joshua

Victoria replied softly, "Our gallery has always been keen on Mr. Thomas's work. I want to give it a shot."

After hearing her request, Samuel thought for a moment and said, "Alright, I'll help you get in touch, but the final outcome will be up to you."

"Thank you, Professor Brown!" Victoria said sincerely.

Two days later, Samuel sent her an address, saying it was Joshua's studio and that she should go there in person to discuss.

After packing her things, Victoria immediately headed to the studio.

The studio was in a private villa area in the southern part of Silvermist City. As the car drove in, Victoria saw a standalone villa nestled in a tree-surrounded courtyard from a distance.

After the car stopped, Victoria got out with her bag.

As soon as she entered the studio, Victoria was greeted by the rich scent of ink.

She looked around and saw that the spacious studio was filled with paintings of various styles. Some were vibrant and bold, seemingly telling passionate stories; others had delicate brushstrokes, depicting a serene and beautiful world.

Yet Victoria's gaze unintentionally fell on an unfinished painting.

In the painting, the outline of a girl was faintly visible.

In front of red walls and gray tiles, she slightly tilted her head, with a few strands of hair gently falling on her cheeks, as if lightly swaying in the breeze.

Although the girl's features were only roughly sketched, one could feel the fresh and delicate beauty within.

She wore a light blue long dress, the hem gently swaying with her movements. Although the colors were not fully rendered, one could already sense the lightness and grace.

The more Victoria looked at the painting, the more familiar it became, and a strange sense of intimacy arose within her.

She tried to search her memory, attempting to find the source of this familiarity.

Was it someone she had seen before?

Her brows furrowed slightly as she fell into deep thought.

Suddenly, the doorbell rang. Victoria turned around and saw Samuel, dressed in casual attire, walking in.

"You're here." Samuel smiled at her and gestured for her to come in, then asked, "What would you like to drink?"

Victoria replied, "Water will be fine."

Samuel then turned and walked out.

A few minutes later, Samuel came back with a glass of water.

"Have a seat. Joshua will be here soon," he said as he sat down next to her.

"Okay." Victoria nodded, but her gaze remained fixed on the unfinished painting on the easel.

Following her gaze, Samuel smiled and asked, "Do you like that painting?"

Victoria pursed her lips and softly said, "Mr. Thomas must really like this girl."

Samuel raised an eyebrow and asked, "Why do you think so?"

Victoria slightly tilted her head, her gaze still on the painting, and slowly said, "You can feel his delicacy and tenderness from the brushstrokes. The girl's expression is depicted so vividly, as if he knows her every move intimately. Even though the painting is unfinished, I can already feel the endless affection he put into it."

Samuel's eyes lit up with appreciation when he heard this. He then said, "Joshua has a quirky temper. What if he refuses to sell the paintings to you?"

Victoria chuckled and said, "Don't worry. I knew there was a chance of failure when I took this job. I'll figure something out."

Samuel nodded and smiled, "That's the spirit."

As they were chatting, the studio door opened again, and a man wearing gold-rimmed glasses and a black suit walked in.

The man was tall, young, and handsome, dressed in a sports outfit. He looked more like an athlete than an artist.

Seeing this, Victoria immediately stood up and respectfully said, "Hello, are you Mr. Thomas?"

Joshua glanced at her, nodded, and smiled. "You must be Victoria?" he asked.

Victoria quickly said, "Yes, I'm Victoria from Starry Studio Gallery."

Joshua looked at her and suddenly said, "I heard you want to buy my paintings?"

Victoria was taken aback, not expecting him to directly mention the real reason for her visit.

Feeling a bit awkward, she still honestly replied, "Yes, I want to purchase your paintings..."

"Sorry, I refuse." Joshua interrupted her without hesitation before she could finish.

"Why?" Victoria asked in astonishment.

She hadn't expected Joshua to reject her outright. A bit anxious, she continued, "May I ask why? If you have any conditions, please let me know. I'll do my best to meet them."

Seeing her somewhat pale face, Samuel felt a bit sorry for her. He quietly pinched Joshua's back and whispered, "Ryan, that's enough."

Victoria thought Samuel was speaking up for her and gratefully smiled at him.

However, Joshua glanced back at Samuel, snorted, and ignored him.

Samuel was left speechless and could only warn Joshua with his eyes.

But Joshua seemed to ignore his warning and continued, "It's not that I don't want to sell the painting to you. It's just that I already have a lot of orders and don't have the energy to take on more. However, if you and Samuel are willing to come by every week to help me with some basic tasks, like mixing colors or sketching, I might consider it."

Hearing this, Victoria looked at Samuel and hesitantly said, "Mr. Thomas, I don't mind, but Professor Brown is quite busy, and I can't..."

Before she could finish, Samuel interrupted, "I can! I have time! It's a great opportunity for me to learn from Mr. Thomas."

Joshua glanced at Samuel with a hint of amusement and said, "Good to see you know your place. In that case, I'll sell you two paintings first. As long as you both keep helping in the studio, I can sell you one painting a month!"

Victoria was so surprised by this sudden turn of events that she didn't know what to say.

She didn't expect Joshua to agree so readily.

Overjoyed, she kept nodding and said, "Thank you, Mr. Thomas!"

"You're welcome," Joshua said with a wave of his hand. "But the price will still be market rate. I won't give you a discount."

"Don't worry," Victoria earnestly promised. "I'll take photos and have our evaluation department assess the price. We won't let you suffer any loss."

"Alright." Joshua nodded in satisfaction.

After taking photos, Victoria chatted with Joshua for a bit, said goodbye to Samuel, and left the studio.

Watching her leave, Ryan Thomas patted Samuel's shoulder and teased in a low voice, "Is she your muse?"

###chapter 33 Step by Step

Samuel shot Ryan a sideways glance without saying a word, then turned back to the unfinished portrait of the girl and picked up his paintbrush.

At that moment, Samuel's eyes were filled with tenderness and focus.

He gently outlined the girl's eyes with the brush, each stroke infused with deep affection.

Her face appeared vividly in his mind-her smile, her gaze, and every detail.

Meanwhile, Ryan stood quietly by, watching Samuel at work, and couldn't help but sigh.

He had never seen Samuel so absorbed in painting a picture.

As time passed, Samuel finally completed the outline of the girl's eyes.

He put down the brush, took a few steps back, and carefully examined his work.

The eyes seemed to come alive, clear and captivating like a bright autumn stream, as if they could see right through one's soul.

At that time, Ryan stepped forward, patted Samuel on the shoulder, and said, "This painting will definitely be your masterpiece."

"I will only give this painting to its owner. There's no way I'm letting you sell it," Samuel said indifferently as he put the brush back into the box.

"Fine, don't sell it then," Ryan shrugged and responded. "But why don't you just tell her you're Joshua? Why go through all this trouble, making her come over every week to paint with you?"

"Pursuing a girl is a gradual process. I have to slowly become a part of her life, let her get used to my presence, and then make her fall in love with me," Samuel said.

"I didn't know you thought like that. I have to hand it to you; you're truly impressive," Ryan said with exaggerated pretension.

Hearing this, Samuel rolled his eyes at Ryan and just ignored him.

"But as far as I know, this Victoria has a close relationship with William Scott. Aren't you afraid of hitting a snag?" Ryan couldn't help but remind Samuel.

Samuel shook his head with a smile and replied, "The Scott family is not a concern, and as for William, he's a fool who can't even understand his own feelings. He poses no threat to me."

"I see!" Ryan dragged out his words, winking at Samuel with a subtle smile. "It seems you have everything under control. Then I wish you success in winning the beauty's heart soon!"

With that, Samuel glanced at Ryan disdainfully and walked upstairs.

Meanwhile, Victoria excitedly showed the photo to Diana.

Diana looked at it several times, confirming it was indeed Joshua's work, and said with rare astonishment, "Are you saying Mr. Thomas is willing to sell us these two paintings and that, as long as you help him one day a week, he will sell us one painting each month?"

Victoria nodded affirmatively, excitedly saying, "Yes, Mr. Thomas promised it!"

She didn't expect it to go so smoothly. She thought tonight would be a wasted trip, but things took a turn for the better.

Not only could she learn painting from Joshua, but she could also help Starry Studio Gallery acquire sought-after works. It was a win-win situation!

Hearing this, Diana also smiled with satisfaction, patted Victoria on the shoulder, and praised, "Well done. No wonder Elara highly recommended you. Next, as long as you pass the final test, you are almost guaranteed to stay."

"Can I ask what the final test is?" Victoria asked nervously.

Diana looked at her with a mysterious smile and said, "It's a secret. You'll find out once you pass the test."

"Alright," Victoria nodded reluctantly, silently praying that the test wouldn't be too difficult.

Three days later, Victoria learned that Wendy had passed the final test with high marks.

Wendy had independently and excellently planned and set up an art exhibition, earning unanimous praise from the entire management and training team at Starry Studio Gallery.

While Victoria was happy for Wendy, it also meant the competition pressure increased. Victoria and the other three were all determined to complete their assigned tasks.

Victoria thought her final test would be similar to Wendy's, like organizing an exhibition or an event.

But boy, was she wrong.

While she was adjusting the positions of paintings at Starry Studio Gallery, a man stormed in with a painting, looking furious. His brows were furrowed, and his eyes were blazing with anger.

The moment he entered the gallery, he shouted, "What kind of lousy gallery is this? The painting I bought last time has a problem."

His voice echoed through the spacious gallery, drawing the attention of other customers.

Seeing this, Victoria hurried over and said gently, "Sir, please don't be angry. What's the problem?"

But the man wasn't having it. He pointed forcefully at the painting in his hand, his voice even louder. "I hung this painting at home for a few days, and it started to fade. Now the painting is mottled and ruined. You guys are ripping people off!"

He slammed the painting onto a nearby display stand. It was indeed from Starry Studio Gallery.

And as he said, several areas had faded, revealing the underlying canvas, which looked particularly abrupt and ugly.

Victoria was just as shocked. She quickly tried to calm him down again, "Sir, please calm down. We apologize for this situation, but rest assured, we will handle it properly and provide you with a satisfactory resolution."

The man, however, was still relentless, demanding, "A satisfactory resolution? Your gallery sells fake and inferior paintings. You must compensate me ten times the loss, or this won't end!"

Victoria's face changed slightly when she heard this. She took a deep breath and tried to maintain a calm tone. "I understand your feelings. Let's wait for the appraisal results, shall we?" she said.

Still angry, the man said, "Then hurry up. I don't have time to waste with you."

Victoria immediately responded, "Sir, please provide the location where the painting was hung. I will arrange for our appraisers to check it right away. In the meantime, please rest in our gallery's VIP lounge. I'll have some refreshments and drinks prepared for you."

Although the man was still visibly angry, he gave his address and followed Victoria to the seating area.

In less than an hour, the appraisers returned and re-examined the painting, then informed Victoria of the results.

After learning the results, Victoria didn't immediately inform the man. Instead, she first contacted Starry Studio Gallery's art advisory team and discussed a more comprehensive solution.

Then, she took a notebook with detailed records to the lounge and patiently explained to the man, "Sir, our appraisers have determined the cause of the problem. The paint isn't fading because of poor quality; it's the high ozone concentration from your laser printer that's causing it. We deeply apologize for this."

The man, half-believing, said, "Really? You're not trying to pull one over on me, are you?"

Hearing this, Victoria solemnly said, "We wouldn't dare deceive you. If you don't believe us, you can have it tested yourself. High ozone concentration not only damages the painting but also poses a significant long-term health risk to you."

The man was silent for a long time, still somewhat unwilling. "But I bought this painting at a high price. Even if my printer is the issue, don't you bear any responsibility?" he said.

Victoria smiled and replied, "Of course, we do. We'll not only repair the painting for free but also let you choose another piece from our gallery's collection as compensation. How does that sound?"

When he heard Victoria's offer, the man's expression softened, but he soon resumed his tough demeanor, saying, "No, I can't just let it go. You have to repair the painting, but you also need to compensate me. After all, I bought it from your gallery, so you are responsible."

###chapter 34 Good Girl, Spread Your Legs

Hearing the guy's words, Victoria frowned a bit but quickly pulled herself together. "Sir, legally speaking, this isn't our fault. We're compensating you out of goodwill. If you push for more, we'll have to go to court. We hope it doesn't come to that, but we won't back down if you keep pushing. It's the worst outcome for both of us."

The man hesitated for a moment and then gave in. "Alright, let's do it your way."

Victoria finally let out a sigh of relief.

That's when she noticed Diana and Frank standing nearby, watching her.

She realized this was her final test-handling unexpected situations.

And she nailed it.

"Great job!" Diana winked at her and said, "Congrats, based on your overall score, you and Wendy have secured the permanent positions!"

Victoria beamed with joy and kept thanking her, "Thank you, Ms. Simpson!"

"It's all your hard work," Diana waved it off. "Tonight, we'll celebrate, and tomorrow we'll sign the contract officially."

Victoria nodded eagerly. Wendy joined her, and the two of them danced around in excitement.

At the welcome party that evening, Victoria drank more wine than usual.

She was over the moon.

From now on, she could do the job she loved and save money to pay Alvin's compensation.

Life finally had hope again.

Dizzy from the drink, Victoria was escorted to her apartment by someone Diana had arranged.

But when Victoria opened the door, she was stunned.

A man was sitting on the sofa with his back to her, casually sipping a glass of red wine.

He had a tall, straight figure, wearing a black suit, with broad shoulders. Even from the back, he looked elegant and noble.

Victoria, feeling the alcohol, stared at him blankly, momentarily forgetting to react.

William looked at her flushed face and drunken state, feeling a certain part of his body stir.

He swallowed hard, trying to control his desire.

"Had too much to drink?" William's deep, husky voice sounded in her ear.

Victoria suddenly sobered up a bit, her eyes widening in surprise. "William? Why are you in my house?"

William placed the wine glass on the table, then stood up, looking down at her with deep, probing eyes. "Why can't I? Afraid I'll bite?" he said.

Victoria felt guilty under his gaze. She averted her eyes and tried to stay calm. "I think I've made it clear. Please leave me alone, okay?"

William snorted and mocked, "You really think you're that desirable," as he took a step towards her.

The dangerous vibe coming from him made Victoria back up until her back was against the wall, with no way out.

Victoria looked up at William, her lips trembling. "What do you want to do?" she asked.

William lowered his head, using his finger to lift her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. Her alcohol-laden breath brushed against his neck, stoking the surging desire within him that was nearly impossible to suppress.

He couldn't help but lower his head, whispering in her ear, "Every time I see you, I want to fuck you, just to make you understand that you can't mess with me. That is, unless I'm done playing with you. Otherwise, don't even think about escaping from me!"

A chill ran through Victoria's heart, and her body trembled uncontrollably, but she stubbornly gritted her teeth and said, "William, I have a new job and new goals now. I won't play your games anymore."

"Really?" William raised an eyebrow. "Is it that gallery job?" he asked.

Victoria nodded, "Yes."

William sneered, "Do you think getting a new job means you can escape from me? Don't be delusional!"

With that, William grabbed Victoria's waist, pulling her into his arms and pressing her against his burning chest.

"Let go!" Victoria used all her strength to push William away, but he held her tightly.

"I've already acquired nearly half of Starry Studio Gallery's shares. If you think you can escape from my grasp, you're dreaming." William's tone was menacing, causing Victoria's heart to contract violently.

To control her, he had gone to such lengths. He was simply a madman!

Victoria felt a chill all over, fear filling her limbs and bones.

She stammered, pleading weakly and helplessly, "William, please let me go. You can have any woman you want, why me?"

"Because I like your body!" William smirked, pausing deliberately before continuing. "How could I let my prey escape?"

With that, William's tongue delved into Victoria's tender lips, intertwining and tasting, savoring the moment.

Victoria's mind went blank, with only a shred of reason left. Desperately, she bit down hard on William's lip until she tasted blood. Through her tears, she looked at him and cried, "William, please let me go!"

William narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "Since you won't take a warning, then you leave me no choice."

With that, he roughly picked Victoria up and opened the bathroom door.

There was a single bathtub filled with warm water, a clear indication of his premeditation.

William carried Victoria inside, throwing her in without any care.

Victoria fell into the water unprepared, the splashing water hitting her face, waking her up completely.

"William, what are you doing?" Victoria frantically supported herself in the tub, looking at William warily. "What do you want?" she asked.

William curled his lips evilly, looking at her with a half-smile. He said, "Why don't you take a guess?"

He then unbuttoned his shirt collar as he slowly approached Victoria.

Victoria was terrified, shaking her head in refusal. She shouted, "No! Don't touch me!"

William bent down slightly, one hand supporting her buttocks, the other gripping her waist, forcing her to kneel on the edge of the tub.

Victoria's clothes were soaked, clinging to her petite and delicate body, which showcased her graceful figure.

William's throat tightened and his breathing grew heavy. "If you won't cooperate, I'll just have to force you." As he spoke, his hand caressed her silky smooth skin, gradually moving up until it stopped at her full chest.

Victoria was terrified, shaking her head and struggling. She repeated, "William, please let me go."

At this moment, William couldn't hear Victoria's pleas. His body seemed to be on fire, ready to explode.

His breathing grew heavier, his eyes filled with desire. He leaned down, kissing Victoria's lips, licking and biting repeatedly until Victoria couldn't breathe, then reluctantly let go of her.

With that, Victoria lay limp in the water, gasping for air.

William then unbuttoned his pants, a suggestive smile on his face. He said, "Good girl; spread your legs."

###chapter 35 I'm Getting Married

William's voice was rough, like a wild animal growling.

He hadn't had any release since the last time he and Victoria were together here.

Victoria begged, "No, please."

But William's lips brushed against her neck and collarbone, his hot, large hand finding her sensitive spot through the thin fabric.

Victoria's body tensed, and she squirmed uncomfortably.

William's eyes darkened as he bent down and sucked on Victoria's nipple hard.

Victoria gasped in pain, her face pale, her eyes pleading.

She kept shaking her head pitifully, tears streaming down, which only stirred something in William.

Seeing her like this made William even more aroused. He bent down and kissed Victoria's tears.

Already terrified, Victoria trembled all over when William kissed her like that. She said, "Don't do this."

William's large hand covered Victoria's breasts, kneading them. His lips moved downward, kissing her lower abdomen.

Victoria shamefully covered her cheeks, not daring to look at him.

William's kisses trailed down from her navel. Victoria nervously grabbed his arm tightly and, gritting her teeth, said, "William, please, don't do this."

William let out a muffled groan, his voice rough and sexy.

His lips continued to rub against her abdomen, leaving one mark after another.

Victoria felt her body heating up, her legs clamping tightly together, her hands involuntarily clenched into fists.

William held down Victoria's restless wrist with one hand, and with the other hand, he reached under her skirt.

Victoria's body tensed up suddenly, her eyes filled with tears.

She shouted, "William, no!"

But Victoria's protest didn't earn William's sympathy; instead, it completely angered him. William tore off Victoria's panties with one hand.

He then lifted her long leg and thrust in forcefully.

Victoria's pupils dilated sharply.

The sudden stimulation made Victoria let out a light cry.

Victoria bit her lip hard, letting the tears slide down her pale cheeks. Her body slowly reacted to William's rhythm.

Seeing Victoria like this excited William even more.

Victoria closed her eyes, trying hard to suppress the waves of sensation coming from her body.

"Victoria, scream!" William roared, thrusting into Victoria forcefully, each thrust harder than the last, reaching the bottom of her vagina. Victoria couldn't bear it any longer and moaned, "No..."

William's eyes grew darker, sweat beads forming on his forehead. The pleasure was almost driving him mad.

He held back the urge to shoot his load, flipping her over, making Victoria sit by the bathtub. His hands clung to her back as he thrust forcefully.

Victoria's body rose and fell with each thrust, and her enticing moans making it impossible for William to stop.

Victoria's tense body gradually softened as she was filled with his presence. In her intoxicated state, she couldn't help but arch her back, wrapping her legs around William's lean, strong waist.

The two intertwined bodies pressed against each other. Victoria's body trembled slightly, and she couldn't help but let out a moan, both charming and seductive.

She tilted her head back, sticking out her small tongue to lick her pink lips, her seductive appearance stunning William, who couldn't hold back any longer, thrusting into her fiercely.

Victoria's body leaned back with each violent thrust, but she couldn't escape William's grip.

William's thrusts grew stronger, and Victoria's heartbeat went wild.

When William finally released, Victoria felt a wave of heat wash over her, making her body convulse uncontrollably before she fainted.

William looked at the unconscious Victoria in his arms, his deep eyes unreadable.

He grabbed a towel and gently wiped her down before helping her into her pajamas, then carried her to the bed.

Afterward, he cleaned up and held the soft, fragrant Victoria as they slept.

Victoria slept soundly. With a warm body next to her, she felt especially peaceful.

When she woke up, the golden morning light seeped through the curtains, filling the room.

Victoria felt like she had forgotten something. She got up and went to the bathroom to wash up.

When she opened the bedroom door, she smelled the aroma of food. She followed the scent to the kitchen and saw William frying eggs.

William was wearing casual clothes and an apron. His tall figure and broad shoulders exuded a strong masculine vibe.

Victoria couldn't help but be stunned for a moment, looking at William's back. The events of last night flooded her mind-how she initially refused, and later shamelessly asked for more.

The most crucial thing was that she remembered William saying he had acquired shares of Starry Studio Gallery, becoming the second-largest shareholder.

In other words, he would still be Victoria's boss in the future!

Her expression shifted quickly, and the joy of becoming a full-time employee disappeared like a splash of cold water.

She lowered her eyelashes, hiding the complex emotions in her eyes, and walked out.

William saw Victoria standing at the door, his face cold. He said, "Breakfast is ready. Wash your hands and get ready to eat."

Victoria looked at the fried eggs and toast on the table. Simple as it was, she was a bit surprised; she had always thought that someone like William, a wealthy heir, probably didn't even know how to light a stove.

Victoria walked to the dining table, sat down, picked up the utensils, and ate silently.

William didn't mind her silence, and the two ate their breakfast without a word.

After breakfast, Victoria finally looked up at William, her expression indifferent. "Mr. Scott, I won't beat around the bush. Even though you are now a shareholder of Starry Studio Gallery, I am now a full-time sales representative at the gallery. I won't be your secretary anymore, and I don't want to be your sex object, so please let me go!" As soon as she finished speaking, she met William's half-smiling expression. She suddenly felt uneasy, a vague sense of apprehension creeping in.

William picked up a napkin to wipe his mouth, then said with a half-smile, "Don't worry. In two months, I'll be marrying Ella. By then, even if you want to be my sex object, you won't have the chance."

Victoria was momentarily stunned. Although she had long known that William and Ella were engaged, she always felt that their personalities were so different that they would never actually make it to marriage.

But now, William was telling Victoria that he was getting married.

Victoria thought, 'Does this mean that in two months, I would be free?'

After the initial shock, she couldn't resist the overwhelming joy.

Seeing the change in her expression, especially the uncontrollable joy at the end, William felt a surge of anger rising from within. He wanted to strangle Victoria.

###chapter 36 The Unspeakable Deal

William held back his anger and spoke softly, "Just behave for the next two months. Once I'm married, I'll give you what you want. Deal?"

Victoria thought it over, then gritted her teeth and agreed.

William tossed a check at her and said, "Here's your pay for this month. You've done well."

He patted her face and walked away.

Victoria picked up the check, clutching it tightly. A whirlwind of emotions hit her.

After a while, she finally put the check away.

Meanwhile, Ella locked herself in her house and turned on all the lights.

Her face was as pale as a ghost, her eyes empty and filled with fear, her body trembling like a leaf.

The horrifying memory of being locked in the basement kept replaying in her mind. Every detail made her shiver.

Willow opened the door and saw Ella, who still looked terrified, even after being back for a few days. Her heart ached, and she called out, "Ella!"

She rushed over and held Ella's cold hand, trying to comfort her. "Goodness, you look absolutely terrified! William is such a jerk! You're his fiancée; how could he do this to you?"

Seeing Willow, Ella clung to her like a lifeline. She cried out, "Mom! I'm scared! There were so many bugs and rats! It was always dark! I'm so scared!"

Hearing this, Willow hugged Ella tightly, her teeth grinding in anger.

Ella, whom Willow had pampered for over twenty years, had suffered so much.

The one behind all this was that wretched woman, Victoria!

If it weren't for that scheming Victoria seducing William, he wouldn't have made Ella suffer like this!

Willow would never let anyone bully her Ella!

This time, she wouldn't let Victoria get away with it!

But since William was so protective of Victoria, going after her directly wouldn't work.

Willow had to come up with a plan and use someone else to do the dirty work. She would make sure Victoria fell from grace and never recovered!

Today, there was a small exhibition, and Victoria was chatting and laughing with Wendy while arranging the displayed works.

Suddenly, the door burst open, and a swarm of media personnel with cameras and microphones rushed in, bombarding Victoria with sharp questions.

"Victoria, it's rumored that you stayed at Starry Studio Gallery by selling your body to the gallery's shareholders. Is that true?"

"With just a high school diploma, how did you get into a gallery that only accepts top university graduates? Is there some shady deal involved?"

"Victoria, everyone is curious, in such a tough job market, what underhanded methods you used to secure a position at Starry Studio Gallery with such low qualifications. Is your body your biggest asset?"

Hearing this, Victoria was stunned, her face turning pale.

She opened her mouth but didn't know where to start.

Wendy was also shocked by the sudden scene but instinctively stood in front of Victoria, angrily saying, "Don't talk nonsense! Victoria is not that kind of person!"

But the media reporters ignored her and continued to press Victoria.

Victoria tried to calm herself, her voice trembling. "These are all rumors. I stayed at the gallery through my own efforts. I didn't take any shortcuts."

But her explanation seemed weak amidst the chaos.

The media reporters didn't believe her words.

Flashes kept going off, lighting up Victoria's pale face.

Seeing the chaos, Diana knew talking wouldn't help, so she called security to kick the reporters out.

Once the room finally quieted down, Wendy let out a sigh of relief.

She looked at Victoria with concern and tried to comfort her, "Those reporters are full of it. Don't let it get to you."

Victoria was still in shock from the sudden incident. Hearing Wendy's words, she forced a smile.

Diana was also annoyed seeing the reporters still hanging around outside the gallery. She knew it wasn't Victoria's fault, but for now, she could only let Victoria stay home for a few days, for both her sake and the gallery's.

Diana sighed and said to Victoria, "Take a few days off. Don't come to the gallery for now, just rest at home."

When Victoria heard this, her face turned even paler, and she stammered, "Ms. Simpson, are you firing me?"

Seeing that Victoria misunderstood, Diana quickly waved her hand and said, "No, I'm just asking you to go home to avoid any trouble. Don't worry, I've already asked the PR department to draft a statement. I know you're innocent and I won't fire you over baseless accusations."

Victoria felt a bit more at ease hearing this.

Seeing Victoria calm down, Diana arranged for someone to drive her home.

However, on the way, Victoria got a call from Elara. Elara said, "Victoria, don't go home yet. There are people swarming outside your house. Find a hotel to hide in for now; don't let them catch you."

Victoria's heart sank. After comforting Elara, Victoria asked her colleague to drop her off at the nearest hotel.

But when Victoria was about to check in, she realized her ID was still at home.

Standing at the hotel entrance, she looked around, not knowing where to go.

She took out her phone and casually scrolled through Instagram, short video apps, and Twitter, only to find them filled with slander and insults against her.

[Victoria, that shameless bitch, will stop at nothing to climb up. She's a disgrace to the art world!]

[How can someone with just a high school diploma get into Starry Studio Gallery? Jobs are so hard to find nowadays. Countless college graduates are unemployed, and even students from prestigious universities are struggling to find work. She must have used underhanded means to steal others' opportunities. What right does she have to stay? Get out of the art world!]

[How dare someone who sells their body still live in this world? She's a parasite on society!]

[Why does a high school graduate get such good resources? She must have used shady methods. Are the shareholders of Starry Studio Gallery blind to let such trash stay there?]

[No wonder, she's Alvin's daughter, just as despicable! Trash genes!]

[Exactly, Alvin and Victoria Carter are two of a kind-garbage!]

One vicious and malicious comment after another stabbed at Victoria's heart like knives.

Her body went weak, almost collapsing to the ground.

Victoria's hands trembled uncontrollably, and tears welled up in her eyes. She couldn't understand why people would maliciously slander her when she had done nothing wrong. Was not finishing college destined to make her feel inferior?

Even if she gave her all and worked hard, could she still not change her fate?

Victoria wandered aimlessly through the streets, her mind blank, feeling dizzy, with a constant buzzing in her ears.

It was as if the world had abandoned her.

###chapter 37 Sorry for Lying to You

William was at a business event when Harry rushed over, having seen something online about Victoria.

William's brows knitted together, and he let out a cold snort. "Isn't she always so stubborn? Don't worry about her. Let her stew for a bit. She'll come crawling back once she learns her lesson."

"But what if she doesn't?" Harry asked, unsure.

A sharp look crossed William's face. "She can't stay away from the gallery job. Just wait and see," he said confidently.

Harry felt uneasy but knew better than to argue. Once William made up his mind, there was no changing it.

"I am off now. I'll ensure to keep you informed of any new updates," Harry said.

William waved him off dismissively.

As he glanced at the wine bottle on the table, William remembered Victoria's reaction when she found out about his engagement that morning.

He narrowed his eyes, picked up the wine glass with his long, clean fingers, and took a sip.

He was curious to see how long Victoria could keep up her stubborn act.

Meanwhile, Victoria was wandering the streets, lost and aimless.

Feeling a cool sensation on her face, she wiped away the tears and realized it had started to drizzle.

Her clothes were getting soaked, and the cold rainwater trickled down her collar, making her shiver.

She hugged herself, curled up into a small ball, and squatted down.

As she cried, she suddenly started laughing-a mix of sorrow and despair.

"How useless," she murmured to herself.

Victoria tilted her head back, closed her eyes, and let the raindrops mix with her tears.

Just then, an umbrella appeared over her, shielding her from the rain.

Victoria opened her eyes to see Samuel holding the umbrella. She stared at him, unmoving.

Samuel, dressed in a camel coat and black pants, looked down at her with a mix of pity and concern.

He reached out, his warm hand touching her cold forehead, and asked gently, "Why are you out here in the rain?"

Victoria blinked her wet eyes and gave a bitter smile. "Professor Brown, I have nowhere to go right now," she said, her voice choked and hoarse.

Samuel moved the umbrella aside, squatted down, and looked at her.

"It's okay; you can stay at my studio for a few days," he said.

He took off his coat and draped it over her shoulders, then gently led her to the blue Bentley parked nearby.

Samuel had quickly contacted Starry Studio Gallery when he saw the news about Victoria and found out where she had last been seen. It didn't take long to find her.

Victoria's cold hand was wrapped in Samuel's warm one, and she felt a twinge of emotion.

Samuel helped her into the car, fastened her seatbelt, then got in the driver's seat and headed to the studio.

Using his fingerprint, he opened the studio door, and Victoria followed him in silence.

Only then did she realize this was Joshua's studio!

In the middle of the studio was a large canvas, the unfinished portrait of a woman that Victoria had seen before, now covered with a cloth.

Why could Samuel unlock this studio?

Victoria's heart was in turmoil as she stared in shock at Samuel's back, struggling to believe it.

Samuel seemed to sense her surprise, turned around, and smiled at her. "Come on, we'll talk later. Change your clothes first," he said.

He handed Victoria a set of studio staff uniforms and continued, "These are brand new, so feel free to wear them. I'll make you a cup of hot tea to warm you up."

Victoria took the clothes in a daze and responded, "Thank you."

She looked at the gentle and handsome Samuel in front of her, her emotions surging.

Victoria went to the bathroom to change her clothes, washed her wet clothes, and hung them up to dry.

She then slowly walked into the living room, where Samuel had already prepared the cold medicine and placed it on the table.

He urged Victoria to drink it quickly, "Take care of your health first. Don't worry about this matter; I'll help you."

Victoria lowered her eyes to the cup of hot tea, her eyes red and brimming with unshed tears.

"Professor Brown, thank you," she murmured, "but I'll handle this myself. I don't want to trouble you."

Samuel pondered for a moment and said, "If you want to handle it yourself, I won't interfere. But if you need my help, just let me know."

"Okay," Victoria responded. She then drank the steaming tea, feeling the warmth spread through her body and her mind clearing.

She looked around the studio and at Samuel, hesitantly asking, "Professor Brown, why do you have..."

Samuel raised an eyebrow and smiled. He asked, "Why can I open this studio door, right?"

Victoria nodded.

Samuel's smile deepened. He continued, "I'm sorry. I lied to you before. You probably guessed it; I'm actually Joshua."

Her suspicion was confirmed, but she was still taken aback. She hadn't expected Samuel to be the artist Joshua, whom she had long admired.

And to help her stay at Starry Studio Gallery, Samuel had willingly sold his paintings to the gallery.

Victoria bit her lip and said seriously, "Professor Brown, thank you. You've helped me so much. But since you're Joshua, why did you want me to come to the studio once a week?"

Samuel smiled slightly, his expression calm. "I wanted to give you more time, but since someone gave me this opportunity, I had to seize it."

He stood up, walked to the covered painting, and pulled off the cloth, revealing a familiar face to Victoria-it was her own portrait.

Seeing this, Victoria was momentarily stunned.

Samuel took out a brush, dipped it in paint, and carefully outlined the eyes.

He was focused and serious, and each stroke seemingly conveyed his feelings, filled with love and tenderness.

His profile was flawless, his clean face like a precious gem.

After he added the final flourish, the painting was truly complete.

The portrait of Victoria had a slight smile, her eyes full of bright joy, exuding a lively vitality, like a delicate and beautiful flower blooming in spring.

Victoria stared at the painting, her heart racing.

Samuel turned around, his gaze gentle, a smile in his eyes. He asked, "Victoria, do you feel my love for you?"

###chapter 38 Wish Her Happiness

Samuel poured his heart into a painting, using it as his ultimate love letter to Victoria.

Victoria was floored by the romantic and stunning artwork, her heart skipping a beat.

Being a painter herself, she could see the care and emotion in every line Samuel had drawn.

She had never seen anything so beautiful. It was like seeing a happier, livelier, but more mature version of herself.

Samuel was wishing her happiness and hope in her future through his art.

How could she not feel the depth of his love?

But she was confused, unsure of what she had done to deserve this, and more importantly, she felt unworthy of such love.

Victoria lowered her head, fighting back tears, and softly shook her head, her voice a bit raspy.

"Professor Brown, I don't get it. Why do you like me?" She looked up at Samuel and continued, "You know my past. How could I ever be a match for you?"

Samuel laughed, his bright eyes locking onto hers. "I don't care about your past; as long as you're willing, I'll always be by your side." He reached out to stroke her hair, his voice low and magnetic, like a fine wine, intoxicating.

Victoria's heart raced, too nervous to speak, avoiding his gaze in a fluster.

She bit her lip, her voice hoarse. "I can't. I'm not worthy of you. We should just..."

"You don't have to rush to reject me; I know this is sudden for you. Don't worry, we artists are very patient." Samuel gently reassured her, "Take your time to think it over, and when you're ready, give me an answer, okay?"

His eyes were so beautiful, so gentle, it was hard to refuse.

Victoria bit her lip, trying hard to suppress the fluttering in her heart.

After a while, she finally mustered the courage to nod. She replied, "I'll think about it carefully; please give me some time."

"Okay, I'll give you time." Samuel smiled with relief and said, "You can stay in the guest room upstairs for the next few days. I've just changed the sheets and bedding for you, so just rest here."

Victoria nodded gratefully, then asked, "What about you?"

Samuel chuckled and replied, "Don't worry. No one will come to the studio these days, and I won't be staying here either. You've had a long day. Get some rest, and don't overthink." With that, he waved at Victoria, "Get some sleep!"

Victoria responded and saw him out of the studio.

After washing up, Victoria lay in bed, thinking about everything that had happened today.

First, she was inexplicably cyberbullied, then Samuel found her, she learned he was Joshua, and then he confessed his love to her.

Her idol, the person she had admired and adored for so long, actually liked her?

The anger from the cyberbullying was gradually replaced by a faint sense of joy.

Victoria patted her flushed cheeks, muttering softly, "Don't overthink. Victoria, calm down!"

Victoria tossed and turned, unable to sleep, as images of Samuel replayed over and over in her mind. Finally, she put on a coat and went downstairs.

Looking at the portrait of herself, Victoria imagined Samuel meticulously painting each stroke, wondering if she could really be with Samuel.

If Samuel didn't mind the difference in their status, she could try to make up for it.

But right now, she was still entangled with William, how could she talk about love?

The thought hit Victoria like a cold splash of water. And thinking of William made her heart ache intensely.

Victoria closed her eyes, trying to suppress the sadness in her chest.

Maybe, after two months, when she had completely ended things with William, she could consider it.

But for now, the most important thing was to clear her name from the slander and online harassment.

Victoria took a deep breath and saw the official statement from Starry Studio Gallery: [Recently, false rumors about our employee Victoria have been widely spread online. Hereby, Starry Studio Gallery formally declares that we have always adhered to professional expertise and overall quality as our hiring criteria, and asserts that there has been no illicit hiring conduct. Victoria was hired based on her own efforts and talent, and she has performed excellently in her work, making positive contributions to Starry Studio Gallery. As for the rumors, we have the right to hold rumor spreaders accountable through legal channels.]

But instead of calming things down, the statement just fueled the fire:

[Victoria must be really capable, the higher-ups are rushing to protect her as soon as this scandal breaks. Who knows how many shady deals are going on behind the scenes.]

[Efforts and talent got her hired? Are you kidding? What kind of talent can a high school graduate have if not for those shady means to climb up? It's disgusting.]

[Having a strong background is different. Someone is always there to clean up the mess. Victoria, keep being smug; one day, your true colors will be exposed.]

[Victoria must have pleased the higher-ups well, that's why they're protecting her!]

[This statement is a joke. If Victoria is really capable, why doesn't she dare to respond to the netizens' doubts directly? Isn't it because she's guilty?]

Reading these nasty comments, Victoria felt a heavy pain in her chest, like a huge stone was blocking her, making it hard to breathe.

The worst part was that they were not only insulting her but also slandering the higher-ups of Starry Studio Gallery.

Victoria clenched her fists. She would never let anyone defame the reputation of Starry Studio Gallery!

Even though Samuel was willing to help her, she still wanted to solve it herself.

She didn't want to owe him too much.

Suddenly, Victoria thought of someone who might be the only one able to help her now. Even though they weren't close and had some past conflicts, she still nervously made the call.

After what felt like forever, Victoria finally put down the phone, a faint smile appearing on her face.

She calmly and composedly began recording a clarification video. In the video, she said, "I am Victoria. First of all, I am very sorry that I have implicated the gallery where I work and consumed too much public attention for my personal issues. At the same time, I want to thank those friends and leaders who have unwaveringly trusted and supported me. Without you, I might not have had the courage to stand here and fight for myself."

At this point, Victoria stood up and bowed, then continued, "I indeed do not have the halo of a high degree, but I have a persistent pursuit and sincere love for art. Like people who work hard for a living, I get up at six in the morning, take a bus, and then transfer to the subway for two hours to get to work. And I don't get home until eight or nine at night to have dinner. I've poured my heart and soul into every project, working tirelessly and investing immense effort. I can proudly say that every step I've taken at Starry Studio Gallery has been earned through my own hard work. If you don't believe me, just check the recently released project list from our gallery; many of the projects have my name on the staff list."

Victoria paused for a moment, then continued, "But even so, some people still think that someone without a college degree like me has no right to outshine the top students from prestigious universities. In other industries, this might not be possible, but in the art industry, a degree is not the only standard to measure a person's ability. Moreover, I was once admitted to Imagination Realm University, but due to family changes, I couldn't continue my studies. However, my teacher, Professor Johnson, still keeps in touch with me and gives me a lot of guidance. If you don't know the status of Professor Johnson, you can look it up."

At the end of the video, Victoria took a deep breath, her tone firm and powerful. "I know that no matter what I say now, it might be questioned, but I still want to ask everyone to give me a chance and the time to prove my innocence. I'm not the despicable person you think I am; I'm just someone who works hard and chases dreams. Please believe in me and don't be misled by rumors."

As soon as the video was released, it caused a huge stir online.

###chapter 39 This Is Her Family

Victoria's Instagram followers were blowing up fast.

These days, attention was everything, and Victoria's follower count shot past a million in no time.

But, of course, there were still plenty of haters.

[Who do you think you are? Who knows if you're just making stuff up.]

[Don't think spinning a story will clear your name. You're just a bad person.]

But some folks had her back too.

[Imagination Realm University isn't easy to get into. Getting accepted means she's got talent. Sometimes, in art, raw talent can beat formal training.]

[Maybe we should really think it over and not be so quick to judge.]

While the internet was buzzing about Victoria's video, Irvin-who had previously questioned the fairness of Victoria's success-posted his own video the next day to set the record straight.

Victoria had called him for help, expecting a no. But to her surprise, Irvin agreed right away.

He said he felt bad for misunderstanding her before and now wanted to help.

In his video, Irvin said, "Hey everyone, I'm Irvin. I graduated from the University of Aesthetics Shine and interned with Victoria. When I found out I lost to her, I publicly questioned how a high school student could beat me. I couldn't accept it, thinking that as a top graduate from the University of Aesthetics Shine, how could I lose to someone with just a high school education? But later, I reviewed all the scores given by our trainers. I had to admit that while Victoria's professional skills might not surpass mine, she is diligent, earnest, and attentive to customers. In practical terms, she is indeed better than us so-called top graduates. More importantly, she has a unique appreciation and aesthetic for art that hasn't been shaped by academic systems. Losing to her is not a loss. I admit my talent is not as good as hers, and there's no shame in that. I will learn from this and work harder in the future. Please stop attacking Victoria. She earned this job through hard work, not shortcuts."

After his video, more people started believing in Victoria, especially young folks who had made it on their own.

Ella was fuming when she saw the public opinion shifting towards Victoria.

Ella had gone to great lengths to ruin Victoria's reputation.

But now, Irvin had stepped in and turned things around.

Ella thought, 'What kind of power does she have to make so many people want to help her? And that Lyra, she's so useless, not providing any decisive evidence, no wonder she lost to Victoria.'

If Ella weren't afraid that William might discover her actions, she wouldn't have had to rely on Lyra.

Ella absolutely couldn't let Victoria clear her name.

Thinking of this, Ella remembered someone and a cold smile appeared on her lips.

She thought to herself, 'Victoria, this time I will make sure you are utterly disgraced!'

She then took out her phone and made a call.

Meanwhile, Wendy called Victoria, happily informing her that more and more people were believing in her.

And the media and onlookers around Starry Studio Gallery had significantly decreased. In a few days, Victoria might be able to work normally again.

Hearing the news, Victoria was over the moon. After hanging up, she felt a huge weight lift off her shoulders.

She'd been stressing about getting kicked out of Starry Studio Gallery. But she never saw it coming when Bobby posted an apology video on her behalf, apologizing to the interns who got cut.

While the video was presented as an apology, it was, in fact, a veiled confession that her position had been secured through backroom dealings.

After watching the video, Victoria was shaking with anger.

Bobby had totally stabbed her in the back, making her look even worse!

Nora tricked her into going to the factory for money, and Bobby slandered her for cash, leading to her being cyberbullied.

Such was her family!

Victoria's face went pale as she watched the internet explode with insults again.

[Even your own brother is testifying against you. What else do you have to say? You're a morally corrupt woman, using despicable means to get ahead, pretending to be innocent. Your acting is really convincing!]

[Do you think making a video can clear your name? You're a hypocrite, deceiving everyone from the start. People like you should be condemned by society and never escape your crimes.]

[Artistic pursuits and hard work? It's all a sham! You're just a manipulative woman using your looks to get ahead, treating us all like fools.]

[And that Irvin, he must be bewitched by Victoria's beauty to speak for her. So what if he graduated from the University of Aesthetics Shine? He was still seduced by this promiscuous woman.]

[Irvin isn't a good person either. Maybe he has an improper relationship with Victoria. Chasing after beauty and lacking principles-someone like that doesn't deserve to be an artist.]

Some radical people even went to Starry Studio Gallery to protest, demanding Victoria be fired.

Even the house Victoria rented got vandalized with red paint, with nasty words written all over it.

Irvin's internship place was also getting harassed, making things tough for him too.

Victoria felt like she was being pushed to the edge.

William's eyes were dark as he looked at the growing wave of insults and slander against Victoria online, his brows furrowed.

Seeing this, Harry softly reminded him, "Mr. Scott, should we step in? If this keeps up, Ms. Carter might not be able to handle it."

William pressed his lips together, his expression grim.

He thought, 'This Victoria is really something. Even after all this bullying, she never thought of asking me for help.'

William had underestimated her pride and resilience.

Seeing William unmoved, Harry tried again, "Hugo has already given Diana an ultimatum. If Victoria can't clear her name, no matter how much Diana speaks for her, she must be fired. Although we are the second-largest shareholder, we don't have actual management rights and can't change Hugo's decision. Do you still want to wait?"

William lowered his gaze, his long fingers tapping the table rhythmically.

After a moment, he looked up at Harry, his tone cold. "Well. I can't let her be bullied forever. Go find someone to handle this immediately and make sure to suppress the trending topics."

Harry breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this, took out his phone, and was about to contact the PR department. His finger swiped across the phone, and he suddenly paused.

He hesitated, looking at William, wanting to say something but stopping.

###chapter 40 My Student

Seeing Harry's face, William frowned and said, "Just say it."

Harry hesitated, then said, "Mr. Scott, we might not need to step in now."

William looked confused. "What do you mean?"

Harry explained, "The trending topics have shifted."

William was taken aback. "Shifted to what?"

Harry handed over his phone and said, "Mr. Thomas is claiming Victoria as his student; turns out Victoria is actually Joshua's student; Shocking: Mr. Thomas's student accused of taking shortcuts; stuff like that."

William grabbed the phone, opened Instagram, and saw that all the nasty posts had been buried.

Joshua, a big shot in the art world, both at home and abroad, never showed up in public.

But now, he had personally set up and verified an Instagram account, which was officially confirmed, just for Victoria's sake.

His first and only post read: [Victoria is my student. Does she need to rely on shady methods to get a gallery job? What a joke!]

With Joshua's backing, the internet went wild.

People were initially shocked by this twist.

It sparked a frenzy in the comments, with many users eagerly sharing the post.

[Oh my God, Joshua's student! That's awesome!]

[Joshua himself got on Instagram to claim her as his student. Unbelievable!]

Some who had previously trashed Victoria now felt pretty embarrassed.

At the same time, some doubted Joshua's words, thinking it might be a publicity stunt.

But soon, others clapped back: [Who is Joshua? He doesn't need cheap tricks for publicity.]

As the debate raged on, more and more people started siding with Victoria. William watched as Joshua completely flipped the script, his lips pressed into a thin line, his face serious.

If Victoria had come to William, he could've fixed everything for her!

But he didn't expect Joshua to swoop in out of nowhere!

He reached for his coffee, but spilled it everywhere, angrily knocking it to the floor.

Harry quickly stepped in to clean up, sneaking a glance at William, who was sitting there radiating cold fury, and muttered, "Mr. Scott, why'd you let such a good chance slip by? If you'd spoken up for Ms. Carter earlier, she'd be grateful and give you her all. Now, someone else beat you to it."

William shot him a cold look and snapped, "Shut up!"

Harry quickly covered his mouth.

William squinted, a dark, complicated look in his eyes, and then said, "Find out who this Joshua really is, why Victoria's suddenly connected to him, and why he's backing her up."

Harry nodded, "Got it, I'll look into it right away."

After Harry left, the big, empty office was just William.

Feeling completely out of the loop, William thought about the close bond between Victoria and Joshua, and a wave of irritation washed over him.

Victoria stared at the Instagram post Samuel had made for her, completely stunned and unable to react for a while.

He actually stood up for her as Joshua!

Wasn't he worried about getting into trouble?

Her heart was a whirlwind of emotions: gratitude, being touched, and a bit of sadness.

The pressure from all the public scrutiny these past days had left her anxious and sleepless. Now, seeing Joshua's statement on Instagram, she finally felt a wave of relief, her heart calming down-only to be replaced by deep worry, afraid of letting him down.

When Samuel walked in with several food boxes, he saw Victoria in a daze.

She looked bewildered, still lost in thought.

Samuel approached, cleared his throat, and said, "Time to eat."

Hearing his familiar voice, Victoria snapped back to reality, realizing Samuel had already come in and the table was filled with delicious dishes.

"When did you come in?" Victoria felt a bit embarrassed. She had been so engrossed in the screen that she hadn't noticed Samuel's entrance.

Samuel smiled and replied, "I've been here for a while. What were you thinking about so deeply?"

"Thank you," she hesitated for a moment and said. "Will saying I'm your student on Instagram affect you?"

Samuel handed her the utensils, smiling slightly. He responded, "Don't you call me Professor Brown every day? It's no problem to say you're my student."

Victoria looked at the food in her bowl, momentarily at a loss for words.

Seeing her still absent-minded, Samuel sighed and said, "If you're really worried, just work hard and achieve something to shut them up!"

When Victoria heard this, her eyes sparkled. Yes, if she were truly excellent, why should she fear those malicious words?

Thinking of this, Victoria solemnly nodded to Samuel and said, "I will work hard."

"That's more like it," Samuel said with satisfaction, "The art association is holding a competition soon. Want to give it a try? I can recommend you."

"Yes!" Victoria immediately nodded excitedly, then hesitated, frowning. "What if I don't win? Wouldn't that embarrass you?" she asked.

"Then I'll expel you from my student list!" Samuel teased her.

Hearing this, Victoria immediately looked distressed. She said, "Don't scare me."

Samuel placed a piece of chicken wing in Victoria's bowl, casually saying, "I've seen your paintings. While there's room for improvement in your technique, your creativity and originality really shine through. With a little guidance from me, winning a place won't be a problem."

Hearing this, Victoria looked up at Samuel happily, just in time to meet his gentle and doting eyes.

His eyes were deep, seemingly capturing her soul, making it hard for her to look away.

Victoria's heart trembled slightly, and she hurriedly lowered her head to avoid Samuel's gaze.

Samuel looked at Victoria's slightly flushed cheeks, feeling a bit moved, and couldn't help but reach out to ruffle her hair.

###chapter 41 How Did You Hit on Joshua

Victoria's whole body went rigid, and her face turned bright red.

She quickly looked down, pretending to be super interested in her food, not daring to glance at Samuel again.

"Hey, slow down. I'm not gonna steal your food," Samuel said, chuckling as he watched her scarf down her meal.

It was only then that Victoria realized she was already pretty full; she had unknowingly eaten more than half a bowl.

It had been ages since she had eaten this much.

It seemed like she could only relax this much when she was with Samuel.

After the meal, they cleaned up the table together.

Samuel pulled out some documents and handed them to Victoria. "Check this out. It's the process and details of the competition. You should start prepping."

Victoria flipped through the papers and nodded. "Okay, don't worry. I'll get ready."

"Alright, I'm heading out now," Samuel said, grabbing his bag and heading for the door.

Suddenly, Victoria grabbed his arm. "Professor Brown, I'm moving back tomorrow. Thanks for everything during this time."

Samuel stopped and turned to look at her, smiling. "Didn't you enjoy staying here?" he asked.

Victoria shook her head. "It's not that I didn't enjoy it. It's just that this is your studio, and it's not right for me to stay here all the time."

Samuel looked at her and nodded. "I respect your decision. Remember, no matter what happens, I'll always be here to help you."

Hearing this, Victoria was momentarily stunned, then lowered her eyes to hide her emotions. "Thank you."

After Samuel left, Victoria sat on the sofa, hugging her knees and staring into space.

No matter what, she had to do her best and not let Samuel's trust and help go to waste.

Early the next morning, Victoria returned to work at Starry Studio Gallery.

Her colleagues excitedly gathered around her, pushing her into a chair and bombarding her with questions.

"Victoria, you're finally back! Tell us, how did you become Joshua's student?"

"Yeah, we're all dying to know. Joshua is a legend in the art world, and you're his student. That's amazing!"

"You really kept this a secret! No wonder you could get two of his works at once before. So you had this connection!"

Victoria felt a bit embarrassed by their enthusiasm. "It was just a coincidence, and I'm only a nominal student. It's not a big deal."

Her colleagues saw that she wasn't eager to talk and expressed their understanding.

"Anyway, it's great now. With Joshua supporting you, those rumors will definitely be dispelled."

"Yeah, we've all seen your hard work and talent. Those people were just talking nonsense."

Everyone was chatting away, making the Starry Studio Gallery lively.

However, Victoria noticed that Wendy was quietly staying in a corner, not saying a word.

Her heart skipped a beat, and she walked over to Wendy, trying to be friendly. "Wendy, I'm back."

Wendy glanced at her and forced a smile. "I see that," Wendy responded.

Wendy didn't know why she felt this way. She had been worried about Victoria, but when she found out that Victoria was Joshua's student, she felt a bit down. She had wanted to celebrate Victoria's return, but seeing so many people around her, she felt uncomfortable and decided to stay in the corner and watch.

Yet Victoria wasn't upset by Wendy's coldness.

She went to the break room, made a cup of coffee, and brought it to Wendy.

Smiling, Victoria said, "Wendy, are you mad at me for not telling you about Mr. Thomas?"

Wendy didn't say anything, still looking down.

Victoria bit her lip and said softly, "Wendy, if I told you that I didn't know the person I knew was Mr. Thomas until yesterday, would you believe me?"

"Really?" Wendy slowly looked up, her eyes filled with doubt.

She finally understood why she was upset. She had talked to Victoria about Joshua many times, and they both admired him. But Victoria had never mentioned that she was Joshua's student, making Wendy feel deceived. More importantly, Wendy felt that Victoria didn't consider her a true friend.

Victoria nodded earnestly and said, "I swear! When I met him, he used a different name. I can't tell you who he is yet, but I swear I didn't know his identity beforehand."

Wendy stared at Victoria, as if trying to determine if she was telling the truth.

Victoria met her gaze steadily.

After a long moment, Wendy snorted, picked up her cup, and took a sip. "I'll believe you this time. But if you lie to me again, our friendship is over!"

Hearing this, Victoria found Wendy's serious little round face incredibly cute.

She couldn't help but step forward, cupping Wendy's face in her hands and giving it a good squeeze. She said, "Wendy, you're so cute like this!"

"What are you doing!" Wendy screamed, covering her face.

Victoria stepped back, smiling, and enjoying Wendy's bashful annoyance that came from her light-hearted teasing.

She glanced at the clock on the wall and said, "It's almost time to open. Let's get to work."

Wendy glared at Victoria and started her own work.

Because of the big news about Victoria, many people in and out of the art circle knew she was Joshua's student.

They came to Starry Studio Gallery out of curiosity to see what Victoria looked like.

Some pretended to be customers wanting to buy her paintings and subtly asked her about Joshua's true identity, but Victoria handled them all skillfully.

She didn't mind the attention. Whether they were genuinely interested in buying art or just there to gawk, she earnestly introduced the various works at Starry Studio Gallery.

Some people were moved by her professionalism and sincerity, and she actually made quite a few sales.

It was almost as much as her sales for the past half month-an unexpected surprise.

As she was about to leave work, her phone rang with a unique ringtone that made her shiver. When she answered, William's voice had a hint of drunkenness. "Come to my place."

Knowing what this invitation meant, Victoria gripped her phone tightly. "I'm really tired today. Can we do this another day?" she asked.

However, William's voice turned cold. "I don't want to repeat myself."

Thinking of their two-month agreement, Victoria gritted her teeth and agreed. "Okay, I'll be there soon."

When Victoria arrived at the Scott Villa, William was lounging on the sofa with his eyes closed.

He was wearing a white shirt paired with black trousers, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, revealing his strong, slender arms.

His features were incredibly handsome, like a male lead straight out of a comic book.

A cigarette dangled from his mouth, the red glow flickering.

Upon hearing her, he opened his eyes and glanced at Victoria.

"I'm going to take a shower," Victoria said softly.

William extended his hand toward her and said, "No need. Come here."

Tonight, his emotions were a bit turbulent, tinged with a hint of anger.

Victoria hesitated for a moment, then walked over to him.

He pressed her onto the sofa, his deep eyes fixed on her, as if he wanted to devour her whole.

He asked, "How did you manage to hit on Joshua?"

###chapter 42 Hurry, Use Your Mouth

Victoria was taken aback for a second and shot back, "Who do you think I'm hitting on?"

William grabbed her delicate neck with one hand, his voice icy, "Besides Joshua, who else could it be?"

Victoria struggled, pushing against his solid chest with both hands.

William's grip tightened, making it harder for her to breathe.

Gasping, she managed to say, "Mr. Thomas is just a teacher I met while auditing at the University of Aesthetics Shine."

As soon as she finished speaking, she felt his fingers loosen around her throat.

Victoria coughed a few times, taking deep breaths to recover.

She really thought she was going to die just now; the feeling of suffocation was unbearable.

William flicked the ash from his cigarette leisurely and said indifferently, "I don't want to hear any nonsense. Tell me the truth. You know I hate being lied to."

Victoria steadied her breathing, slumping on the sofa like a dead fish.

After a while, she sat up.

Her pale face had a strange flush, her hair disheveled, looking somewhat pitiful.

Lowering her eyes, Victoria said hoarsely, "I'm not lying to you. Mr. Thomas is really just a mentor I met while auditing. He took me in as a student out of pity because I was being cyberbullied, but he hasn't actually taught me anything."

Victoria wasn't lying; even if William investigated, he would only find this.

William raised an eyebrow and asked, "That's all?"

"Yes, that's all," Victoria confirmed.

William stared at her for a while, then suddenly sneered.

Victoria was startled, not knowing what his laugh meant.

"Fine, remember what you said. If you dare to flirt with other men behind my back..." William looked at Victoria coldly, a hint of ruthlessness flashing in his eyes before quickly disappearing.

Seeing this, Victoria felt a pang of anxiety.

Thinking of Samuel's confession, she felt a wave of bitterness surge in her heart. Her eyes moistened as she lowered her head without speaking.

"Alright, I've finished my questions. Now for the real business," William said and patted the spot next to him, signaling her to sit over.

Victoria hesitated for a moment but eventually moved over.

As soon as she sat down next to William, he wrapped his arms around her slender, soft waist.

His warm, broad hand rested on her buttocks, kneading through the thin fabric.

Victoria's face immediately turned red, her waist twisting, but she didn't resist for once.

William, satisfied, tightened his grip on her waist, his deep voice sounding in her ear. "That's better. Although watching you resist is quite appetizing, it gets boring after a while."

With that, he stood up and lifted her into his arms.

The sudden feeling of being airborne made Victoria instinctively wrap her arms around his neck.

William carried her to the edge of a bathtub the size of half a room.

He kissed her small earlobe tenderly and said, "The bathtub at your place was too small. I couldn't even exert myself properly last time; I felt really frustrated. This bathtub is big enough. How about we take a bath together?"

William's voice seemed tinged with the steamy mist. His scorching lips fell on her neck and continued downward.

Victoria felt a flush of heat from his shameless words, shyly turning her face away.

Seeing this, William chuckled lowly.

The water was already more than halfway full, emitting a steamy heat, and both of them felt increasingly hot.

William lifted her again and placed her in the water.

Her top was completely soaked, the thin layer of fabric becoming transparent, revealing the outline of her black underwear underneath.

William's gaze grew even more intense.

"Help me undress, got it?" William said flippantly.

Hearing this, Victoria bit her lip, not moving.

"Unwilling? You can choose to leave, but our two-month agreement will be void," William said, starting to unzip his pants.

Victoria quickly grabbed his hand, biting her lower lip. "I'll help you undress," she said.

William leaned back in the bathtub, crossing his legs, enjoying the feel of Victoria's soft hands moving over his body.

After saying that, she climbed off his lap, knelt down, and started unbuttoning his shirt, removing the wet garment.

When it came to his pants, she hesitated.

William urged, "Hurry up. If you take any longer, we'll starve tonight!"

Victoria looked up, meeting his deep, dark eyes, her heart skipping a beat.

She bit her lip and reached for his zipper, slowly pulling down his pants. "Now, is this okay?" she asked.

William, barely able to contain himself, had been suppressing his urges. He replied, "Keep going, there's still one more."

When Victoria heard this, her hand paused for a moment before continuing to remove his underwear.

When their bodies were completely exposed to each other, his erection was already standing at attention for her.

Victoria's face suddenly burned, her head lowering even further.

"It's not your first time. Do I need to teach you what to do next?" William teased deliberately.

Victoria looked up, her eyes misty, looking particularly enticing.

William felt like he was about to explode from holding back, but he still restrained himself, urging, "Hurry up, use your mouth."

Victoria's face turned crimson. Although she had been with him many times, she had never given him a blowjob.

Now being forced, her heart raced, her legs stiffening.

William continued, "Hurry up. I'm waiting for you to please me!"

Victoria licked her dry lips, slowly bending down.

She approached his firm waist, extending her pink tongue to gently lick his erection.

Each touch sent a tingling sensation through him, William squinting his eyes, his Adam's apple bobbing as he let out a low growl.

He felt like all the blood in his body was rushing to one place, ready to burst out.

He groaned, grabbed her shoulders, and began thrusting rapidly into her mouth.

Victoria felt like her throat was being pierced.

She was extremely uncomfortable, unable to help but whimper.

Seeing this, William pulled his erection out of her mouth.

He lifted her onto his lap, gripping her waist, and thrust into her forcefully.

Victoria cried out, her body trembling from the impact.

Her cheeks were flushed, looking beautiful and alluring, her eyes gazing at him with deep affection.

She originally had a pure and delicate appearance, but now, her brows and eyes had taken on a seductive charm.

William's gaze deepened as he leaned forward to press against her. His voice was hoarse as he murmured, "Baby, you're such a tempting enchantress!"

Victoria's face turned even redder at his words, her body going limp.

She stammered, "I'm not..."

However, William rudely covered her lips, prying open her teeth, and entangling her tongue with his.

His lips trailed down, gently nibbling on her nipples, while his lower body continued to thrust into her.

Victoria felt like her body was floating on clouds, as if she was about to leave the earth.

Their breathing grew heavy.

William's breathing became labored, sweat beads forming on his forehead.

Victoria felt like she was about to suffocate, her strength completely drained.

Finally, William was released.

Victoria lay in his arms, panting heavily, her cheeks flushed, looking so beautiful that he couldn't get enough of her.

He then carried her out of the bathroom.

Victoria, completely exhausted, let William carry her to the bed, cover her with a blanket, and then press down on her again, continuing to explore her with vigor.

They tangled on the bed for a while until Victoria was so tired she was about to fall asleep.

William held her in his arms, looking at her with an inexplicable expression. He said, "There's a business dinner tomorrow. You're coming with me."

Victoria, barely hearing him, responded perfunctorily before closing her eyes and drifting off to sleep.

###chapter 43 Come with Me to a Banquet

The next morning, Victoria woke up still wrapped up in William's arms.

She quietly opened her eyes and saw his chiseled profile.

The warmth from his body made her skin feel unusually hot.

His arm was like a vice, making it impossible for her to wiggle free.

She tried to push him gently, but he didn't budge.

"William," she whispered.

No response.

Victoria frowned and tried to wriggle out of his grip.

Suddenly, William rolled over, pinning her beneath him. "Didn't anyone ever tell you not to squirm in a man's arms first thing in the morning?" he said.

She felt his morning wood pressing against her and froze.

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

They'd gone at it several times last night. Wasn't he tired?

Was this guy for real?

William raised an eyebrow and teased, "What's on your mind?"

"Nothing," she said, quickly looking away.

Seeing she wasn't lying, William let it go. He released her, sat up, and said, "Get up, it's time for breakfast."

He got out of bed, got dressed, and left the room.

Victoria got up, put on the spare clothes she had brought, and freshened up.

She headed to the dining room.

William was already dressed in a white suit, standing by the window, talking on the phone.

A gentle smile, one she'd never seen before, spread across his face. "Yeah, I just got up," he said.

Seeing her, he pointed to the breakfast spread on the table.

Victoria sat down and started eating her oatmeal.

"Okay, take care," William said into the phone.

After hanging up, he looked at Victoria and smiled. "You've been more obedient than I expected lately."

Victoria lowered her eyes and said, "You promised me freedom in two months. I should be smart and not piss you off."

William's good mood vanished. He sneered, "Since you're so sensible, I hope you'll be just as obedient at tonight's business dinner."

Victoria frowned. "What business dinner?"

"Didn't you agree last night? Or are you planning to back out?" William's tone was threatening.

Victoria remembered his demands from last night. Did she agree to something?

"Alright," she sighed. "But at least tell me who I'm dealing with!"

William, satisfied with her compliance, said, "Remember Kirk and Rufus? You promised them you'd follow up on that project, but then you quit. The project's almost done, and they specifically asked for you tonight."

Victoria remembered Rufus's lecherous looks and felt disgusted.

But she didn't want to anger William.

"I'll come after work," she reluctantly agreed.

She grabbed her bag and left for work.

William watched her go, his gaze unreadable.

He thought, 'Victoria, I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it. Don't blame me for teaching you a lesson.'

After a long, grueling day at work, Victoria felt like her legs were about to give out.

She rubbed her sore legs and turned down Wendy's dinner invite.

She freshened up her makeup to look a bit more alive and grabbed a cab to the address William had given her.

When she found the private room, she pushed the door open and stepped inside.

Besides William, the only other people there were Kirk and Rufus, who she'd met before.

Rufus's eyes roamed over her shamelessly, while Kirk was busy chatting with William about the project's profits.

Victoria hated the way Rufus looked at her. She lowered her head and softly said, "Sorry I'm late."

Rufus patted the seat next to him and smiled warmly, "Ms. Carter, come on in. Have a seat and make yourself comfortable."

His eyes stayed glued to her, making her feel grossed out.

She hesitated, but William gave her a look that told her to sit next to Rufus.

Reluctantly, she sat down.

Rufus's eyes lit up. He put his hand on her shoulder and leaned in closer.

"Ms. Carter, since you're late, you owe us three drinks," he said.

Victoria instinctively pulled away, grabbed a glass of wine, and downed it in one go.

The wine spilled down her neck and into her collarbone, hinting at her cleavage.

Rufus's gaze was burning into Victoria.

Victoria's face darkened, and she awkwardly adjusted her neckline to cover up.

Rufus licked his lips, looking unsatisfied.

William watched Rufus's behavior with growing impatience, sipping water to hide his disgust.

If his grandfather hadn't disapproved of him and hadn't pushed him to forge his own path, he wouldn't have to deal with people like Rufus.

But William thought using Rufus to teach Victoria a lesson wouldn't hurt. She'd lied to him about Joshua, and if he didn't put her in her place, she'd get too bold.

A sinister smile crept onto William's face.

Rufus couldn't take his eyes off Victoria.

He moved closer, touched her arm, and said, "One glass isn't enough; we agreed on three."

Victoria felt sick under his gaze. She forced herself to stay calm and said, "Mr. Chapman, you're doing great. Why make things hard for me?"

Rufus squinted, displeased. "What? Ms. Carter, you weren't like this before. Think the project's done, so you don't need to humor us anymore?"

"Mr. Chapman, you're joking. How could I dare?" Victoria forced a smile and apologized.

Rufus, pleased, patted her shoulder.

"Ms. Carter, you're straightforward. Let's keep drinking," he said, handing her another glass.

Victoria reluctantly took it and drank.

She glanced at William, but he was indifferent, laughing and chatting with Kirk.

Her heart sank.

She knew William was making things hard for her because of the Joshua incident.

Victoria smiled bitterly. Even after last night, William had no mercy.

Such a William was truly terrifying.

She put down the glass and said, "Excuse me, Mr. Chapman. I need to use the restroom."

Without waiting for his permission, she headed to the restroom and vomited.

After washing her hands, she was about to leave when someone grabbed her wrist.

She turned and met Rufus's lecherous gaze, making her scream and step back. "Mr. Chapman, you..."

###chapter 44 Why Didn't You Call for Help

Fueled by the booze, Rufus flashed a sleazy grin, his greasy, pudgy face lighting up. "Ms. Carter, don't be so shy. Be my woman, and I'll make sure you're happy," he slurred.

As he spoke, Rufus shut the bathroom door and reached for Victoria's chest.

Victoria screamed, quickly covering herself and struggling desperately.

"Let go!" she shouted.

She fought with all her might, but Rufus's grip was too strong.

Rufus laughed, holding her tightly with both hands.

Unable to break free, Victoria kicked and hit him with everything she had.

But how could a frail woman overpower a fat man?

William and Kirk were deep in conversation when they heard the commotion from the bathroom and immediately stopped talking.

Kirk knew exactly what kind of person Rufus was.

He glanced at William to gauge his reaction.

But William's expression remained unchanged, cold as ice.

Kirk then touched his nose and continued chatting, pretending he hadn't heard anything.

On the surface, William appeared calm, but under the table, his hand was clenched into a fist, veins bulging.

'Damn it! Doesn't Victoria know to ask me for help?' he thought.

Just because she was mad at him, she'd rather be violated by that ugly Rufus?

Victoria wanted to call for help, but her throat, sore from being choked by William the night before and the alcohol just now, burned with pain. Combined with the alcohol she had consumed and her overwhelming fear, she couldn't speak.

She could only let Rufus tear open the buttons on her shirt, pinning her hands above her head against the wall.

Rufus's alcohol-laden mouth kissed Victoria's delicate neck.

Victoria felt extremely nauseous, but her body was limp, unable to muster the strength to struggle.

She looked at the bathroom door in despair, hoping that William would remember their time together and come to her rescue.

She desperately tried to shout, "William, help me!" But no sound came from her throat.

However, the commotion in the bathroom was too loud for those outside not to hear.

The only reason William hadn't reacted must be intentional.

He was deliberately letting someone humiliate Victoria, to get back at her!

In his eyes, she was nothing more than a whore to be humiliated.

When she realized this, her heart was filled with despair.

But the more desperate she felt, the more she couldn't belittle herself.

She had a new job and new friends. William couldn't, and didn't deserve to, ruin her life.

Rufus's repulsive, fat hand had already reached under her skirt, moving upward.

In an instant, Victoria became fierce. Her hands and feet were restrained, but she still had her mouth!

She used all her strength to bite Rufus's ear, tearing off a large chunk.

"Bitch!" Rufus cried out in pain.

Furious and humiliated, he raised his hand and slapped Victoria hard.

Victoria fell to the ground, her cheek quickly swelling and reddening.

Ignoring everything else, she got up and ran out of the bathroom.

"Stupid bitch!" Rufus cursed and chased after her.

Victoria stumbled to the table, not caring about William's extremely displeased expression.

She grabbed a wine bottle and smashed it over Rufus's head as he caught up.

Caught off guard, Rufus took the hit to the forehead, blood splattering everywhere.

He glared at Victoria, seething with hatred. "You bitch, how dare you hit me? I'll kill you!" he snarled, swinging his fist at her.

Victoria, exhausted, couldn't dodge, watching helplessly as Rufus lunged at her.

At the critical moment, William stood up, grabbed Rufus's fist, and kicked him away.

Rufus hit the ground, screaming in pain.

Seeing Rufus in such a state, Kirk quickly checked on him and found that, aside from the missing chunk of his ear, he was mostly unharmed.

He then glared at Victoria and William and said, "What are you doing? This was supposed to be a celebration, and now you're trying to kill him?"

William shielded Victoria behind him, his gaze deep and cold.

"Don't you know what filthy thing he did?" William asked.

Kirk was momentarily stunned, then laughed, "Mr. Scott, you can say whatever you want, but do you have any evidence?"

This seemed to remind Rufus, who struggled to his feet and shouted, "Who the hell do you think you are? Didn't you give her to me yourself? Now you're playing the hero?"

William stiffened, glancing back at Victoria, who still had her head down, her expression unreadable.

Seeing this, Rufus grew even more arrogant and sneered, "William, you got tired of Victoria and tossed her to me. Now you're pretending to be righteous? How disgusting."

William's face darkened, almost dripping with anger, and he roared, "Shut up!"

Rufus laughed maniacally and said, "Who do you think you are? Telling me to shut up? Do you believe I'll terminate our contract right now and make you lose everything?"

Hearing this, William laughed, but his eyes grew colder.

He suddenly walked over to Rufus, squatted down, and patted his flabby face. "Do you think you can offend me so easily? I tailored products for your company, knowing all your strengths, weaknesses, and even your secrets, like your tapioca-free tapioca flour," he said.

Rufus and Kirk's faces turned pale; they didn't expect that William even knew about that.

William stood up, looking down at them. He continued, "I hope you'll double the advertising fee for the Scott Group's hard work, or I might start talking."

With that threat, William pulled Victoria away.

Rufus and Kirk exchanged glances, and after a while, Kirk sighed, "Rufus, we've really lost big this time."

Rufus's face turned ashen as he realized he had been set up by William-using Victoria to create a rift and then seizing the opportunity to extort more investment. Utterly cunning.

He gritted his teeth, eyes filled with malice. "Once I deal with William, I'll skin him alive and sell that slut Victoria as a prostitute!" he spat.

William led Victoria out of the hotel and into his dark blue Maybach, where Harry immediately drove away. Throughout the ride, Victoria kept her head down in silence. William, feeling inexplicably guilty, reached out to wipe the blood from her mouth, but she turned her head away.

The car fell into a suffocating silence.

William couldn't stand the silence. He suddenly asked, "Why didn't you call for my help earlier?"

###chapter 45 You Will Regret It

Victoria gave William the cold shoulder, making him frown hard. With a voice dripping with annoyance, he snapped, "Talk to me!"

Victoria glanced up, her eyes welling up with tears. She bit her lip, shaking as she tried to get the words out.

But as soon as she tried to speak, she felt as if she was choking, with her throat burning intensely, and her eyes got even more watery.

William's chest was heaving, his face turning a nasty shade of red.

Trying to keep his anger in check, he softened his tone a bit and said, "Alright, whatever happened is done. Don't worry, I'll make sure you get justice!"

Hearing this, Victoria thought, 'So this is William-so cunning, so heartless! He never saw me as an equal.'

To him, she was just a tool, a pawn he could use, someone he could insult and trample on whenever he wanted.

Yet she still had hopes for this cruel, heartless devil!

How ironic!

Victoria suddenly felt exhausted, a wave of weariness washing over her, and she slowly closed her eyes.

William saw her unresponsive demeanor, and his mood hit rock bottom.

Clearly, Victoria hadn't asked for his help, yet now she looked like she was on the verge of death.

Hadn't he already taught that jerk a lesson for her?

What more did she want?

Did she expect him to apologize?

William felt extreme disgust.

"Since you don't want to talk to me, I won't waste my time. Harry, stop the car!" he barked.

Startled and unsure of what had ticked William off, Harry quickly hit the brakes and pulled over.

William opened the car door, got out, walked to the other side, and yanked Victoria out.

His grip was too strong, causing Victoria to stumble and fall awkwardly onto the road.

William looked down at her, his gaze icy. He said, "Victoria, you better understand your place. You're nothing but a plaything I bought. You have no right to throw a tantrum with me!"

He paused, then added, "If you keep pissing me off, you'll regret it!"

But Victoria gritted her teeth, lifting her defiant eyes to meet his cold, bone-chilling gaze, and finally forced out a single word: "Whatever!"

Even saying just one word made her throat burn painfully.

William's anger flared up when he sensed her stubborn attitude, and he kicked her in the stomach.

Victoria let out a muffled groan, collapsing to the ground.

She propped herself up on her knees, curling her body, her shoulders trembling slightly as if crying, but she tried hard not to make a sound.

Seeing her in such pain, William regretted his impulsiveness.

But apologizing to her? No way.

He thought Victoria needed to suffer to learn her lesson.

So William gave her a cold glance, then turned and got back into the car.

Harry looked at Victoria's miserable state in the rearview mirror, then at William's tense profile, feeling a mix of emotions.

Victoria, such a tough girl, would rather take a beating than beg for mercy.

But William was heartless, completely ignoring her feelings.

Glancing at William in the back seat, Harry couldn't help but say, "Mr. Scott, it's pitch dark. Are we really going to leave Ms. Carter here?"

William waved his hand impatiently and said, "Enough, just drive! Isn't she tough? Why are you worried about her?"

Harry sighed and stepped on the gas.

Victoria lay on the ground, her back aching from the cold, but she stubbornly stayed silent.

The shadows of the trees above fell on her pale cheeks, making her look even more desolate and lonely.

She lay there, staring at the gray, hazy night sky.

She was never one to give up easily, but today, she suddenly felt tired of living.

Nora, always scheming to take from her.

Bobby, backstabbing her for his own gain.

Alvin, the only one who cared for her, suffering in prison, and she could do nothing for him.

And here she was, selling her body, selling her dignity, yet still holding onto a sliver of hope that William, who bought her, would show her some pity.

It turned out to be her Stockholm syndrome manifesting as a masochistic tendency.

She was utterly despicable, both mentally and physically!

She had never hated herself so much for clinging to life.

The sound of a text message suddenly broke the silence of the night.

Victoria was momentarily stunned before reacting.

She struggled to sit up, fumbled for her phone in her bag, and swiped the screen to check.

It was from Samuel: [How's the preparation for the competition going?]

Victoria's fingers trembled slightly as she held the phone, and it took her a while to reply: [I'm preparing.]

[Samuel: Okay! Keep it up! You are the 'Wounded Angel,' and one day you will rise towards the sun!]

Victoria stared at the words on the screen for a long time before slowly locking the screen.

"The Wounded Angel" was a famous painting by the symbolist master Hugo Simberg.

In the painting, two boys carried an injured angel on a stretcher.

The angel's eyes were bandaged, its wings battered, but it held a few snowdrops in its hands.

Despite the image's sense of decay, desolation, and negativity, the snowdrops symbolized healing and rebirth, representing hope for the future even when severely wounded.

It gave people the courage to persevere through hardships.

Victoria understood Samuel's intention.

In this world, besides Alvin, there was Samuel who cared for her.

Victoria felt a warmth in her heart, her nose stinging, and her eyes misting with tears.

She struggled to get up from the ground, her body still swaying slightly.

Leaning against the wall of the alley, she slowly moved forward.

Others might bully her, insult her, or look down on her, but would she just accept it?

No, she wouldn't.

She would live out her abilities and values, making everyone look at her in a new light.

Even if she was humble to the dust, she would never again bow and scrape, allowing others to trample on her.

Victoria wiped the tears from her cheeks and, with heavy steps, took a shortcut to the subway station.

Meanwhile, William sat in the car, his face so cold it seemed to solidify.

The recent scene replayed in his mind, and he felt a twinge of softness.

He rubbed his temples, exhaling irritably.

Victoria was like a poison!

Whenever William encountered her, he lost his rationality.

William sighed deeply and ordered Harry, "Turn back!"

###chapter 46 The Wounded Angel

Harry was already creeping along, just waiting for William's signal.

The moment he heard it, he cranked the wheel, slammed the gas, and the sports car roared to life.

When they got back to where they had been, Victoria was gone.

William pulled out his phone, stared at Victoria's number, hesitated, then dialed.

Meanwhile, Victoria was at the subway station, waiting for the train. Her clothes were a mess, and she was half-squatting, clutching her stomach in pain.

Then her phone rang.

She pulled it out, saw who was calling, and froze.

A bitter smile crept onto her pale face.

They were done, and now William wanted to call and rub salt in the wound?

Without a second thought, she hit reject.

After that, she blocked his number.

Today, she had played her part in the scheme and made back a hundred times what he had spent on her.

From now on, she wanted nothing to do with him.

William stared at the disconnected call, his brows knitting together, lips pressed tight.

Was Victoria out of her mind to hang up on him?

Harry glanced in the rearview mirror, saw William's stormy expression, and wisely kept his mouth shut.

The air in the car was so thick that it felt like you could hardly breathe.

William gripped his phone, anger bubbling up inside him.

He had swallowed his pride to come back for her and even called her.

How could she be so ungrateful?

Harry sneaked another look at William and cautiously asked, "Mr. Scott, should I take you home now?"

William shot him a frosty glare, and Harry clammed up, not daring to say another word.

William swallowed his anger and called Victoria again.

This time, he got a message saying the call couldn't go through.

His face darkened even more. He looked at Harry, an idea forming. "Give me your phone!"

Harry handed it over, and William quickly dialed Victoria's number.

The call connected, but she hung up again.

When William tried again, it wouldn't connect.

In a fit of rage, William hurled the phone at the windshield, shattering it.

The loud crash echoed in the car, then silence fell.

William clenched his teeth, veins bulging on his forehead.

'Damn Victoria! Blocking my number? Does she really think she's that tough? Let's see how she manages without my protection. What can her weak self do?'

"Drive!" William barked, his anger palpable.

Harry shivered, glancing sadly at his shattered phone.

Did William forget it was his phone?

And it was brand new!

Harry felt like crying but started the car in silence.

Victoria dragged herself home, exhausted.

It was dark, no lights on.

She didn't bother turning them on, heading straight to her easel and switching on the wall lamp.

The dim light cast shadows around the room.

She didn't change out of her dirty clothes or tend to her small cuts and bruises.

She picked up a charcoal pencil and started sketching.

She wanted to capture her sadness and frustration.

But more importantly, she wanted to convey her resolve to live well in her sketch.

Victoria lost track of time as she drew.

Her legs were numb, her wrist stiff, and she could barely hold the pencil anymore.

But when she saw the finished sketch, a faint smile of relief crossed her lips.

The drawing showed a dark forest with twisted trees, their branches tangled together like a giant cage.

The ground was littered with fallen leaves and dead branches, giving off a sense of decay.

In the heart of the forest, a white deer lay curled up, its fur a bit messy. It looked up at the blue sky with eyes full of emptiness and despair, but also a hint of hope and struggle.

Around the deer were broken mirror fragments, reflecting its shattered past. But on its back, a pair of magnificent wings were slowly growing. These wings were colorful and dreamlike, the feathers gently fluttering, ready to break free and soar into the sky.

Victoria put down the charcoal pencil, leaned against the drawing table, and let out a long sigh of relief.

She then stripped off her dirty clothes, tossed them in the trash, took a shower, and changed into clean pajamas.

She applied ointment to her wounds and drank some syrup to soothe her throat.

After all that, she collapsed into bed and fell asleep, exhausted.

The next morning, the warm sun broke through the clouds and shone on the roof.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains, chasing away the cold of the previous night.

Her body and throat still ached a bit, but it was nothing new for Victoria, who was used to getting hurt.

While she was washing up, she heard a knock on the door.

Elara came in with a bowl of oatmeal, concern in her voice. "Victoria, why did you come home so late again last night? I heard noises in the middle of the night."

She looked at Victoria's pale, tired face with worry.

Victoria felt a bit warm inside but held back her tears, managing to say, "Elara, don't worry. I just went out with friends yesterday."

Elara handed her the bowl and said softly, "That's good. I thought you had to work overtime at the gallery."

Victoria took the bowl, scooped up a spoonful of oatmeal, and ate it.

The sweet taste spread in her mouth, making her feel a bit better, even though her throat was still sore.

Victoria looked up and gave Elara a bright smile, hoarsely saying, "Thank you, Elara."

Elara gently patted her head and said, "No need to be formal with me. Eat it while it's hot. I spent a long time making it."

"Okay." Victoria nodded.

Watching Victoria eat breakfast, Elara felt a surge of affection.

She was such a good girl, so obedient and capable.

It was just a pity that Victoria had had some unfortunate family issues.

Elara looked around and noticed that it was almost winter, and Victoria still had thin bedding and sheets.

Victoria must be too busy with work to have time to change to thicker bedding.

Thinking of this, Elara said, "Victoria, it's been getting cold lately. If you don't mind, I can take out your winter clothes and change the bedding for you, okay?"

Hearing this, Victoria was momentarily stunned and quickly shook her head. "No need, Elara. I can take care of it myself over the weekend."

Elara scolded her gently, "You're being too formal with me. I see you as my own daughter. Are you going to distance yourself from me?"

###chapter 47 It's All Because of Me

Victoria looked down and murmured, "Thanks, Elara."

"Not at all, Victoria. Let's eat," Elara said, giving her shoulder a gentle pat.

Later, Victoria gathered her stuff and headed to work. Before she left, she gave Elara a tight hug.

"Elara, thanks a lot," she said.

Elara was taken aback for a second. She softly stroked Victoria's hair and reassured her, "You're welcome, Victoria; just focus on your job."

After Victoria left, Elara started sorting through Victoria's seasonal clothes.

Since the weather was nice, she decided to wash Victoria's bedding and other laundry.

While she was busy, there was a sudden loud knock on the door.

Elara frowned.

Could it be some kid messing around?

She sighed, opened the door, ready to give the person a piece of her mind.

To her surprise, standing at the door were Ella and Willow, both dressed to the nines.

They had planned to ruin Victoria's reputation through Lyra.

But they didn't expect Joshua to show up and wreck their plan.

So they had lost millions of dollars for nothing.

Ella and Willow weren't about to let this slide.

With the wedding coming up, they were even more frustrated with nowhere to vent their anger.

Seeing all their schemes fail, Ella and Willow feared that if they tried anything more drastic, William would get really mad and call off the wedding. After a long discussion, they decided to confront Victoria directly. Whether by bribery or threats, they were determined to make her leave William, and even if it caused a scene, they were confident it wouldn't affect them.

So Ella and Willow went straight to Victoria's house and rang the doorbell.

Elara didn't recognize Ella and Willow and thought they were Victoria's friends because of their fancy clothes.

So she politely asked, "Are you here to see Victoria?"

In a fit of rage, Willow just ignored Elara. She shoved her aside and yelled, "Where's that bitch Victoria? Get her out here!"

Elara was almost knocked over by the sudden push.

Hearing Willow call Victoria a bitch, she immediately glared.

"Who are you? How dare you insult Victoria!" Elara demanded sternly.

"Who we are is none of your business! I just want to know where that slut Victoria is! Get her out here!" Ella pointed at Victoria's room and screamed.

Elara, usually calm, couldn't take it anymore.

She grabbed Willow's arm and shouted, "Leave now, or I'll call the cops!"

Elara's actions made Willow even angrier.

"Call the cops? That's a joke!" Willow laughed and continued, "Go ahead. Let's see if they arrest us or that slut Victoria for seducing my daughter's fiancé! Shameless!"

Elara wiped the spit off her face in disgust and said, "You must be mistaken. Victoria isn't like that!"

"If not her, then who?" Ella sneered, "She's been sleeping with my fiancé countless times as his secretary and taking a lot of money from him every month to treat her mother. How do you think a little secretary can afford to keep her mother in the hospital?"

Elara's face went rigid, and she started to wonder if Ella and Willow might be telling the truth.

But she stubbornly defended Victoria, "You're lying! Victoria isn't like that!"

"You're still defending that bitch!" Ella fumed. "Do you think I won't trash this place right now?"

She started to break things, but Elara held her back.

"Let go of me!" Ella struggled angrily.

Elara gripped Ella's arm tightly and said, "Let's sit down and talk. Don't do anything crazy!"

"You bastard, blocking my way. I'll teach you a lesson today!" Ella grabbed Elara's hair and yanked hard, cursing nonstop.

Elara, usually calm, was completely enraged by Ella's actions.

She lunged at Ella, and they started fighting.

Elara tried to scratch Ella's face, while Ella flailed her arms to fend her off.

Seeing Ella fighting, Willow couldn't just stand by and rushed to help.

She grabbed Elara's arm and cursed, "Mind your own business! Today, you'll see just how powerful we can be!"

Ella pulled Elara's arm forcefully and occasionally shoved her.

Willow and Ella beat Elara badly.

Finally, the community security called the police.

Meanwhile, Victoria had been busy working all day. Her throat was sore, so she didn't go out to greet customers.

Instead, she was adjusting the display of her works and organizing materials.

After a long day, she had just sat down to rest when she got a message from a stranger claiming to be Elara's son.

Victoria immediately took a cab to the hospital.

Elara was badly injured, with a gash on her forehead, a twisted waist, and bruises and scratches all over her body, looking very frightening.

Seeing Elara, who had been so full of energy in the morning, now in such a state, brought tears to Victoria's eyes.

She held Elara's swollen and bruised hand and said hoarsely, "Elara..."

"Why are you crying?" Elara lay in bed, enduring the pain. She said, "Don't worry. They didn't get away unscathed. I scratched their faces!" Elara showed a hint of pride.

Hearing Elara's words, Victoria cried even harder.

She choked, "I'm sorry. It's all because of me that you got hurt so badly."

"Silly girl." Elara lovingly stroked Victoria's long hair and comforted her, "Stop crying. I'm fine. But your voice sounds hoarse. What's wrong?"

"Elara, I'm fine! Don't lie to me." Victoria shook her head, crying uncontrollably. "You're bleeding so much. It must be very painful."

"Really, I'm fine." Elara forced a smile, sighed, and gently held her hand, "Victoria, I know it's not really my place to say this, but since you don't have any family at home and I think of you as my own child, I'll say a few words. Don't take it to heart if I'm wrong."

"Elara..." Victoria sniffled.

Elara continued, "Although we haven't known each other for long, I understand your character and integrity. I believe you're not that kind of person, so there must be another reason for your relationship with Mr. Scott."

###chapter 48 Move Out of My House

Elara stressed, "Look, no matter how Mr. Scott and Ms. Garcia feel about each other, and no matter what promises Mr. Scott made to you, Ms. Garcia is his fiancée. If she comes over and yells at you, you just have to take it! You're young and naive, but you can't keep getting tangled up in this mess. It'll ruin you!"

Victoria felt a tightness in her chest as she listened to Elara's heartfelt words, making it hard to breathe.

She lowered her head and stayed quiet for a bit before slowly looking up. "Elara, thanks for telling me this. I know you mean well. Don't worry, I know what to do."

Seeing that Victoria had taken her advice to heart, Elara sighed in relief.

"Good, as long as you understand. I just hope you can get out of this situation soon and not get deeper into it."

Elara truly cared for Victoria, so when Ella and Willow showed up, she did her best to defend her!

"Elara, I'm really sorry." Victoria lowered her head, seeing the bruises on Elara's hand, and gently rested her forehead on it, crying in distress.

"I'm fine, really! Stop crying!" Elara reached out and gently stroked Victoria's hair.

At that moment, the door opened, and a tall, thin young man walked in with some medicine.

He looked to be about twenty-seven, dressed in a black suit, looking very handsome and capable.

Seeing Victoria, he just glanced at her briefly before looking away.

"Mom, I got your medicine. Take it first." Robert Davis handed the medicine to the bedside.

Elara's eyes reddened with grievance when Robert came in, but she stayed silent because Victoria was there.

Victoria poured a cup of warm water and brought it over. "Elara, take your medicine."

Elara nodded slightly.

Seeing Elara take the medicine, Robert turned to Victoria and asked somewhat discontentedly, "Are you Victoria? Is it because of you that my mom got hurt?"

"Yes, I'm sorry," Victoria said softly, feeling extremely guilty.

Robert snorted coldly, "What's the point of saying that now? Please handle your personal life properly and don't drag others into it. Also, please find another place to live and move out of our house. I won't rent it to you anymore."

His words were very rude, and Victoria's face instantly turned red.

"Robert, what nonsense are you talking about!" Elara called out to Robert, signaling him to stop talking.

Elara then turned to Victoria and said, "Victoria, don't take it to heart. Robert just has a bad temper. You stay here and don't worry about him!"

"No," Victoria shook her head and said. "This is indeed my fault. I'm sorry."

If it weren't for her attachment to Elara, she would have agreed to move out.

But she couldn't bear to leave her.

"Just go already, and stop being a nuisance here," Robert said with a frown. "My mom needs to rest!"

"I can't leave..." Victoria bit her lip, hesitated for a long time, and then said, "Elara got hurt because of me. I want to stay and take care of her for the next couple of days."

"Suit yourself," Robert said impatiently. "Just make sure you don't disturb my mom's rest."

He then turned to Elara and said, "I've already called the police. They'll come by later to ask you a few questions. Just tell them the truth."

Elara glanced at Victoria and then waved her hand to Robert, saying, "It's not a big deal. Why call the police? I'm fine. Tell them not to come."

Victoria knew Elara didn't want to make things harder for her by blowing this up.

If it had been her getting hurt, Victoria would have endured it silently. But it was Elara lying there!

She couldn't let Elara suffer just to save her own reputation!

Before Robert could say anything, Victoria firmly said, "If someone does something wrong, they have to pay the price. We must call the police!"

Robert was taken aback, clearly not expecting her to say that. His gaze toward her started to shift slightly.

Elara, of course, was unwilling, but no matter what she said, Victoria was determined.

Seeing Victoria's resolute expression, Robert tentatively asked, "Ms. Carter, have you thought this through? Going through the legal process can be very troublesome, and we might not get the result we want."

Victoria shook her head, her eyes firm. "I know it might be troublesome, but I can't just let it go. They can't bully Elara without facing any consequences," she responded.

Elara hurriedly said, "Victoria, let it go. Don't make such a big deal out of it because of me. It's not a big deal; I'll be fine after some rest."

Victoria held Elara's hand, gentle but firm. "They must be held accountable for their actions. You can't just suffer in vain. Don't worry, I'll face this with you."

Robert looked at Victoria, his impression of her slightly changing.

He looked at Elara and said, "Mom, did you forget I'm a lawyer? I'll personally handle your case. What are you afraid of?"

Hearing this, Elara remembered and said sheepishly, "Look at me. I completely forgot about you. Robert, I'll rely on you then."

Robert rolled his eyes helplessly. "I got it. You rest well. I'll go prepare the documents."

Elara was about to nod when she suddenly remembered Victoria and immediately said, "Victoria hasn't had dinner yet. Take her to get something to eat!"

"Mom! I have work to do," Robert said, somewhat unwilling.

Victoria noticed Robert's displeasure and quickly said, "Elara, don't worry about me. I'm not hungry. You must be tired; I'll stay here with you."

"You need to eat. You need energy to take care of me!" Elara felt a pang of distress seeing Victoria so thin and frail. She then turned to Robert and shouted, "I told you to take her to get something to eat, so go! Are you ignoring me now?"

Unable to argue with her, Robert finally agreed to take Victoria out to get something to eat.

At a fast-food restaurant outside the hospital, they each ordered a simple plate of spaghetti.

Victoria seemed to have little appetite, putting down her utensils after just a few bites.

She looked at Robert, hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Mr. Davis, I'm really sorry about today."

Robert glanced at Victoria, his tone cold. "You don't need to apologize to me."

He paused for a moment and then added, "There's nothing left to say between us."

Victoria froze, lowering her eyes, not daring to meet Robert's gaze.

"Anything else? If not, I'm leaving," Robert said indifferently, preparing to leave.

"Wait," Victoria called out to him.

"Anything else?" Robert turned and asked.

Victoria bit her lip and said, "Can't I move out? I promise nothing like this will happen again! I swear!"

Seeing Victoria's earnest expression, Robert found it amusing and sarcastically said, "What do you have to promise? Your words?"

###chapter 49 Let's Not Meet Again

Victoria clenched her jaw but couldn't come up with a comeback; she really had no guarantees.

"That's it. I'm super busy," Robert said, ready to turn and leave.

Just then, his phone rang. He glanced at the number, frowned, and picked up.

Victoria overheard him saying things like "no way" and "see you in court."

After hanging up, Robert looked at Victoria and said, "The other side doesn't want to make a big deal out of this. Their lawyer called, asking for a settlement and compensation. What do you think?"

Victoria was quiet for a moment, then shook her head. "No way! We're taking this all the way! They need to pay and be punished!"

Robert raised an eyebrow, looking at Victoria. "You sure about that?"

Victoria nodded firmly.

Her words made Robert's attitude soften a bit. At least she wasn't just after the money.

"Alright, I'll go back to the ward and tell my mom to be ready," Robert said, standing up and heading back.

Victoria jogged to keep up with him.

Just as they reached the ward door, it swung open, and Harry was about to leave.

Seeing Victoria and Robert, he paused and looked back.

Following his gaze, Victoria saw William behind him.

His face was dark and menacing, the hostility radiating off him was chilling.

Victoria instinctively took a step back.

Robert frowned. Even though he didn't like Victoria, he couldn't stand seeing a man bully a woman.

So he stepped forward slightly, blocking William's view, and coldly asked, "Who are you?"

William didn't even glance at Robert, staring straight at Victoria like he wanted to kill her.

Victoria didn't want any more drama with him and instinctively hid behind Robert.

His presence was unexpected for Victoria.

Of course, she didn't think he was there to sincerely visit Elara, but more likely to persuade Elara on behalf of Ella.

"Sir!" Robert coldly looked at William and said, "Who are you looking for? If you have no business here, please step aside. We need to go in!"

William finally moved his gaze from Victoria, looked at Robert indifferently, and said, "Mr. Davis? Can we talk?"

"Sure," Robert replied. Then he turned to Victoria and said, "You go in and talk to my mom. I'll be there soon."

Even though he had always been hostile towards Victoria, at this moment, he seemed inexplicably trustworthy.

Victoria responded softly and then pushed the door open and went inside.

William watched her obedient demeanor, which was a stark contrast to her arrogance when confronting him last night.

Regardless, in this situation, William didn't want to argue with Victoria about yesterday's events.

William's eyes turned cold as he walked past them into the hallway. Soon, Robert followed.

Victoria entered the ward and saw Elara waving at her. Elara looked at the door and whispered, "Mr. Scott came to apologize."

Victoria wasn't surprised and responded angrily, "Is he apologizing and then asking for a settlement?"

Elara smiled, gently pinching her cheek. She replied, "A settlement isn't a big deal. I didn't want to make a big fuss."

"But..." Victoria hesitated.

Seeing this, Elara advised, "Victoria, you're still young. Don't let these troubles affect you. Besides, Mr. Scott is right; the Garcia family is not to be trifled with. If this escalates, it might be bad for you. If we settle now, Mr. Scott can handle them. He also promised that if the Garcia family harms you again, he will personally deal with it."

Victoria bit her lip, looking conflicted. "I just can't accept it! I'd rather be the one lying here!" she said.

Elara chuckled, knowing Victoria had a good heart, and whispered, "He also promised to hand over their company's legal affairs to Robert and compensate me with a million dollars! With this compensation, Robert won't have to worry about supporting a wife!"

Victoria was amused by her, then sighed and said, "Mr. Davis is so outstanding; you don't need to worry about him. You're doing this for me."

Elara patted her shoulder and said earnestly, "Silly girl, I'm looking out for you, but I'm not losing out either, right? I believe in moderation. Don't push things too far, or you'll suffer."

Victoria looked at her, feeling a pang of sadness.

Victoria lowered her head and responded, "Elara, I will help you get justice for your suffering!"

Elara paused, then smiled and said, "Alright."

Soon, Robert came in.

Victoria could guess the outcome: William had convinced Elara, and Robert was just being informed.

Even if Robert was unwilling, he couldn't go against Elara's wishes as her son.

After a few words with Elara and a glance at Victoria, he left.

Seeing Elara looking tired, Victoria helped her lie down to rest.

Victoria then took a book from her bag and started reading and taking notes by the bed. After over half an hour, she felt tired and saw that Elara was still sleeping.

Victoria thought Elara might be hungry if she woke up in the middle of the night, so she went out to buy some pastries and fruit.

As soon as she stepped out of the hospital, she saw a black Maybach parked at the entrance.

Victoria's expression changed, but she pretended not to notice.

But as the car window rolled down, her face stiffened.

William leaned back in his seat, looking serious and deep. His long legs were elegantly crossed, and he stared at her intently.

His gaze was oppressive, as if he wanted to devour Victoria.

Victoria looked away, pretending not to notice him, and walked towards the supermarket.

"If you dare to leave, I guarantee you'll regret it." William's cold, deep voice came from behind, making Victoria stop abruptly.

William's words successfully halted Victoria.

She clenched her fingers, slowly turned around, met his cold eyes, and hoarsely said, "Mr. Scott, I thought you came to apologize to Elara today."

When he heard her hoarse voice, William's heart skipped a beat, as if he had forgotten something important.

William collected his thoughts, his expression softening slightly, and said, "I've already apologized to Elara on behalf of Ella. I've also instructed Ella that this will never happen again."

Victoria sneered, "Should I thank you?"

He frowned and replied, "Do you have to be sarcastic?"

"What else? Should I bow and thank you for your magnanimity?" she smiled, her gaze firm. "Ella sent people to humiliate me, then to force me to settle, sent people to beat my father in prison, and then locked me in a basement, almost costing me my life. You promised me justice! But today? Even my landlord was beaten into the hospital by them. Is this your guarantee? Just because the Scott family and the Garcia family have money and power, you can use and bully us without consequence?" she retorted.

William pressed his lips together, his face gloomy.

He knew Victoria wasn't just talking about Elara's incident but also what happened yesterday.

He was indeed somewhat at fault.

But wasn't it all her own doing?

Thinking of this, he was about to speak.

But then, Victoria continued, "William, forget about the two-month deadline. Starting today, let's not see each other anymore."

###chapter 50 Are You Threatening Me?

William didn't see that coming.

His eyes went icy, and his lips twisted into a sneer. "Are you threatening me?" he shot back.

Victoria held his gaze. "If that's what you think, then there's nothing more to say."

Suddenly, William got out of the car, towering over Victoria, looking down at her.

His eyes were like ice, cold and unfeeling.

He leaned in close to her ear, speaking slowly and deliberately. "Who do you think you are? Just because you're good in bed, you think I can't let you go?"

His voice was low, but it still caught the attention of people passing by.

William finished, expecting Victoria to blow up.

But she stayed calm.

She looked at him, her gaze steady and cold. "Of course, I know I'm nothing to you, Mr. Scott."

Her calmness made William feel suffocated.

She went on, "I've told you before, Ella loves you deeply, so she does foolish things. You're about to marry her, whether it's for love or some other reason, it has nothing to do with me. I don't want to get involved in your marriage. You promised me this wouldn't happen again, but you didn't keep your word. You won't do anything to her because of me or anyone else who means nothing to you. Please, for the sake of me being a pawn in your game yesterday, let me go, okay?"

William sneered, "Are you saying this because you've found someone new?"

His words stung, but Victoria was used to his disdain, especially after he'd been drinking. She wasn't fazed by his insults anymore.

"Yes," she said bluntly.

William's eyes narrowed, burning with anger as he glared at her.

Victoria was startled by the intensity of his gaze, but she stood her ground, looking at him without fear.

"Is it Joshua? Or Robert today? You're pretty good at seducing men!" William mocked.

Victoria didn't get angry. Instead, she smiled faintly. "William, say whatever you want if it makes you feel better. Just leave me alone."

"Is that how you ask for a favor?" William raised an eyebrow.

"Do you want me to beg?" she asked.

William didn't answer.

Victoria bit her lip, looked up, and met his gaze. "Fine! If that's what it takes, I'll beg! William, I'm begging you, please stay out of my life!" With that, Victoria actually knelt in front of William.

The November chill in Silvermist City was particularly biting this year, yet Victoria wore only thin clothes. Her knees hit the hard concrete, sending a jolt of pain through her body.

But she didn't care!

As long as she could get away from him, she'd do anything.

"Victoria!" William didn't expect her to kneel, his face turning pale.

"What are you doing?" he roared, reaching out to pull Victoria up, but she dodged.

"Please!" Victoria said, looking at him calmly. "Be merciful and let me go!"

Hearing this, William clenched his fists, the veins on his arms bulging.

He opened his hands, a sneer on his lips. "If that's what you want, fine. Be that way." With that, he turned and walked away.

When he disappeared around the corner, Victoria finally couldn't hold on any longer and collapsed, exhausted.

Was she eventually free from him?

Victoria closed her eyes, feeling a wave of bitterness. Her actions must have really pissed him off. But that was good. Finally, she was free.

To take care of Elara, Victoria asked Diana for a few days off and arranged to work online.

Luckily, with the internet being so advanced, businesses weren't just about offline sales anymore.

Even though she couldn't go to Starry Studio Gallery, she could still get her work done online.

Elara noticed how pale and tired Victoria looked from taking care of her and couldn't help but say, "Victoria, I'm fine now. I just need a couple more days to recover. Look at you-you've been so exhausted taking care of me!"

Victoria smiled and shook her head. "Elara, are you trying to get rid of me?" she teased.

"Of course not..." Elara quickly replied. "I'm just worried. Taking care of me and working... How will you manage?"

Victoria smiled and said, "It's okay, Elara."

Elara sighed, knowing she couldn't change Victoria's mind, so she let it go.

During this time, Robert came to the hospital to see Elara almost every day.

By the time he arrived, Elara had taken her medicine and fallen asleep. Victoria was working at a small table nearby.

Hearing footsteps, Victoria looked up.

She gave Robert a polite smile when she saw him. He nodded back.

His eyes fell on the corner, where copies of the "Construction Quality Management Regulations" and the "Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure" were displayed. He asked, "Are you still studying this?"

"Yes," Victoria nodded. "I want to learn more about my dad's case."

"Your dad?" Robert was surprised.

Victoria explained, "Yes. My dad was sentenced to ten years for a design issue, and I want to see if I can help him."

Robert frowned, thinking for a moment before recalling the nationally sensational stadium collapse case and the bridge collapse case ten years ago.

He realized the person involved was also named Alvin Carter. This, then, was Victoria's father.

Victoria noticed Robert's thoughtful expression and lowered her eyes.

"Do you suspect something?" As a lawyer, Robert knew the law wasn't always perfect.

Especially when powerful people stirred things up behind the scenes for their own interests.

"My dad was always serious and responsible about his work. I never believed he would make such a low-level mistake." Victoria bit her lip, her eyes slightly red.

Seeing this, Robert hesitated and asked, "Didn't your dad have a lawyer to defend him at the time?"

Hearing this, Victoria was stunned.

She was studying abroad at the time, and by the time she returned, Alvin had already been convicted.

She had never seen his lawyer.

Seeing this, Robert suggested, "If you really want to investigate your dad's case, you should first ask his lawyer. No one knows the ins and outs of the case better than him."

Victoria's eyes lit up. "Thank you," she said, offering him a sincere bow. "I know what to do now."

Robert quickly stopped her and said, "Not at all. I just saw how hard you were working to take care of Elara and gave a casual reminder."

Victoria smiled and said, "No matter what, I still have to thank you."

As they were talking, Elara woke up, and they ended their conversation.

Elara stayed in the hospital for five days before she could finally be discharged.

After helping Robert take Elara home, Victoria returned to her normal work routine.

Without William's interference, Victoria worked hard during the day and focused on painting her competition piece at night.

A week later, she finally finished the initial draft of "The Wounded White Deer."

On Saturday, feeling both nervous and excited, Victoria carefully brought the painting to Samuel's studio.

###chapter 51 Why Are You Always So Distant With Me

The studio had that familiar mix of paint and turpentine in the air, with sunlight pouring through the big windows, casting warm spots on the floor.

Samuel carefully set the painting on the easel and took a few steps back, quietly studying it.

Victoria stood off to the side, nervously fidgeting with her hands, waiting for his feedback.

Samuel looked more serious than ever.

His profile was striking, with a high nose bridge and sharp, focused eyes.

After what felt like forever, he finally turned to look at Victoria.

Victoria nervously licked her lips, holding her breath, waiting for his thoughts.

"Not bad." He broke the silence, noticing her hands shaking with anxiety, and finally smiled, giving a simple nod of approval.

Victoria's eyes widened in surprise.

"Really?" she asked, her face lighting up.

"Really," Samuel said, a smile tugging at his lips. "It's definitely good enough for the competition, though there's always room for improvement."

Victoria let out a huge sigh of relief, collapsing into a chair like a deflated balloon.

Samuel chuckled at her reaction and continued, "You've captured the white deer beautifully. The hurt and confusion in its eyes are really striking."

He walked up to the painting, pointing out details on the white deer. "The texture of the feathers here and the layering of the forest in the background are really well done."

Hearing Samuel's praise, Victoria felt a rush of joy, but she knew there was still a lot to learn.

She stepped closer to her work and asked, "Professor Brown, what do you think I should work on?"

Samuel thought for a moment, then said, "From a composition standpoint, you could adjust the position and size of the white deer to make it stand out more. Also, enhancing the color contrast would make the painting more impactful."

Victoria listened carefully, marking the changes with a pencil on the paper.

Samuel stood beside her, offering tips now and then. When Victoria misunderstood something, he gently corrected her, his hand briefly covering hers.

Victoria's heart raced as she felt his long fingers around her hand.

They were so close their breaths mingled.

Victoria suddenly felt a strange sensation and instinctively pulled back.

But Samuel's grip tightened, his gaze intense as if he wanted to melt her defenses.

Victoria awkwardly tugged at the corners of her mouth and tentatively asked, "Professor Brown, you..."

"Call me Samuel," he said hoarsely, "That title is too formal."

Victoria's cheeks turned red at his words, and she stammered, "Samuel."

Samuel looked at her gently, smiling. "Good girl."

They had spent a lot of time together, but never like this. Victoria's heart was pounding, and she didn't dare get too close to Samuel, afraid she'd lose her cool.

"I-I'll go get the drawing board," Victoria said quickly, then hurried to her desk.

Samuel watched her retreat, unable to hide his smile.

After going over some more details, it was time for lunch, and Victoria offered to treat.

Victoria was just about to call him Professor Brown, then quickly corrected herself, "Samuel, I just got paid. Let me treat you to a meal."

Samuel had helped her so much, and she hadn't had a chance to thank him properly.

She had just been promoted at Starry Studio Gallery, and her performance this month was good, earning her a couple of thousand dollars.

Although it was nothing compared to Samuel's income, it was a token of her appreciation.

Hearing this, Samuel readily agreed, "Sure, I won't refuse."

Victoria smiled and said, "I know a nearby restaurant that's pretty good. Let's go try it!"

"Okay." Samuel nodded.

After tidying up, they left.

Samuel found a parking spot, and they took the elevator to the top floor.

The restaurant manager saw Victoria and warmly greeted her, "Ms. Carter, it's been a while. What brings you here today?"

Victoria used to be a regular at this restaurant, often coming here for their Escargot, which Alvin frequently brought her to enjoy.

She was beautiful and polite, so the manager naturally remembered her.

"I'm here for lunch with a friend," Victoria said with a smile.

The manager nodded with a smile and led them into the restaurant.

The restaurant was simply and cleanly decorated, with several famous paintings on the walls.

Samuel glanced around, his gaze finally settling on a table by the window.

"Ms. Carter, this way please," the manager said, leading them to the window seat.

Samuel pulled out a chair for Victoria with a gentlemanly gesture. She thanked him before taking her seat.

The waiter brought the menu, and Victoria handed it to Samuel. "Samuel, order whatever you like. Don't be formal."

Samuel smiled and replied, "Alright, I won't hold back then."

He then ordered a few signature dishes, including the Escargot that Victoria had mentioned.

When the dishes were served, Victoria raised her juice glass and smiled at Samuel. "Samuel, thank you..."

Before she could finish, Samuel placed his hand on her glass and shook his head. "If you keep thanking me like this, I'll get angry." His tone was so serious that Victoria was momentarily stunned.

A weary sigh escaped Samuel's lips as he watched her. "Victoria," he said, the helplessness evident in his voice, "you know my feelings. Why do you insist on keeping your distance?"

His words struck a chord deep within Victoria, and she lowered her eyelashes to hide the turmoil in her heart.

She said, "I'm sorry."

Disappointment flashed in Samuel's eyes, but he forced a smile and said lightly, "There's no need for apologies between us."

With that, he placed Victoria's favorite Escargot on her plate.

Victoria looked down at the glistening Escargot, her nose tingling with emotion. She tried to suppress her feelings and looked up at Samuel with a bright smile.

A gentle smile touched Samuel's lips, and his eyes softened with warmth.

He thought, 'She's still young and shy, no rush!'

Noticing some sauce on the corner of Victoria's mouth, Samuel gently took a few napkins and wiped it away.

His actions were natural and smooth, without any awkwardness.

This tender moment was all witnessed by William, who had just walked in.

###chapter 52 Aren't You Going to Introduce Us?

William's eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing in them.

Victoria sensed something was off and glanced toward the noise.

William walked in with a few people, dressed in a black suit. His face was stern, and he had a frosty vibe.

He gave off a gloomy, intimidating aura.

Since the day she begged him for mercy, Victoria hadn't seen William for over two weeks.

Her palms clenched involuntarily, her heart pounding at his sudden appearance.

Samuel noticed Victoria's stiffness and looked up to see William.

He caught Victoria's reaction, his brow furrowing slightly. His gaze flickered to William before he casually looked away, shifting in his seat just enough to break William's intense stare.

His casual demeanor hid a sharp edge.

Seeing Samuel's protective stance, William felt a surge of anger.

He strode past their table and sat down at a seat in front.

However, Samuel ignored William, turned to Victoria, and asked, "What's wrong?"

Hearing this, Victoria quickly gathered her thoughts and forced a faint smile. "Nothing."

Samuel smiled, put on disposable gloves, and began peeling shrimp for her.

His fingers were long and slender, with distinct bones and smooth, rounded nails. His actions were skillful and elegant.

Victoria stared blankly at his movements, unsure of what expression to make.

Samuel then finished peeling the shrimp and placed it on Victoria's plate.

Seeing this, Victoria felt a bit overwhelmed and said self-deprecatingly, "It's okay. I can do it myself. Since I was a child, only my dad has peeled shrimp for me. At home, I always peeled shrimp for my mom and brother."

"From now on, I'll take over the job of peeling shrimp for you," Samuel joked, his gaze soft and warm, like the gentle sunlight of spring.

Victoria was amused by him and couldn't help but laugh.

The two chatted and laughed, creating a very pleasant atmosphere.

Meanwhile, William's gaze remained on them, deep and chilling.

Victoria looked much better now. She used to be pale and haggard, but now her face was rosy, and she smiled brightly at Samuel across from her.

Samuel looked several years older than her. Time had given him a calm and restrained charm, elegant manners, and an excellent upbringing, clearly indicating a distinguished background.

The more William thought about it, the more his inner fire burned.

Was Victoria so happy after leaving him?

Did she find a man much older than her? Was she blind?

A menacing aura radiated from William as his eyes narrowed dangerously, reducing Harry to a trembling, breathless mess beside him.

William had been in a bad mood lately, and now he had encountered a trigger.

Harry silently prayed that he wouldn't get involved, or he would be in big trouble!

"Mr. Scott, how about we go to another place?" he asked bravely.

"No need," William replied slowly, then stood up and walked straight to Samuel's table.

Victoria's face blanched in an instant as she saw him approach.

Samuel looked up, noticing William walking towards them, but maintained a gentle and humble smile. "Sir, can I help you?" he asked.

Yet William didn't even glance at Samuel, staring directly at Victoria.

Victoria was so scared that she could hardly breathe. She gritted her teeth and glared at him, her eyes full of warning.

William casually placed a hand on the back of her chair, leaned in slightly, and whispered near her ear, "What a coincidence, Ms. Carter!"

He dragged out the last part of her name, making it sound like a threat.

Victoria clenched her fists and took a deep breath, trying to stay calm.

They were no longer involved. What was there to be afraid of?

With that thought, Victoria regained her composure and responded calmly, "Yes, quite a coincidence, Mr. Scott."

William sneered, his gaze shifting to Samuel. "Ms. Carter, aren't you going to introduce your new friend?" He emphasized the word 'friend.'

Victoria was about to refuse when Samuel's deep, magnetic voice cut in.

Samuel nodded slightly, extended his right hand to William, and said politely, "Samuel Brown, Victoria's male friend."

William's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze locking with Samuel's before he slowly extended his hand.

"Hello. William Scott, Victoria's former boss," William responded.

As their hands clasped, the atmosphere grew tense.

Though William tightened his grip, Samuel met the pressure with a calm, unwavering smile.

But to William, that smile was infuriating!

He increased the pressure, trying to crush Samuel's hand.

However, Samuel maintained his composure, his smile never wavering, appearing refined and courteous.

Victoria watched their confrontation nervously but had no reason to intervene.

Their handshake lasted for a while, until both their palms were sweaty, before they finally let go.

William then withdrew his hand, put it in his pocket, and looked down at Samuel, his tone icy. "Mr. Brown, quite impressive!"

Samuel smiled warmly and said, "Likewise."

William sneered, gave Victoria a deep look, then turned and walked out.

Harry quickly followed, anxiously saying, "Mr. Scott, wait for me."

After William left, Samuel turned his attention back to Victoria. "Are you okay?" he asked.

Victoria nodded, still anxious, and said worriedly, "I'm sorry for causing you this trouble."

Samuel shrugged indifferently and said, "Just a kid who hasn't grown up. Don't worry, I don't take him seriously."

Not even understanding his own feelings, what else could William be but a child?

He acted like a schoolboy who bullied the girl he liked.

But it was just as well; it gave Samuel an opportunity.

After William left, Victoria lost her appetite and couldn't muster any interest. She only drank two glasses of juice to fill her stomach.

Noticing her in a bad state, Samuel considerately stood up and said, "Victoria, let me take you home."

Victoria nodded.

They got into Samuel's car in the parking garage, and Samuel pulled the seatbelt over to buckle it for Victoria.

His actions were natural, his demeanor easy, not feeling anything inappropriate.

When his fingers lightly touched Victoria's skin, she instinctively shrank her neck.

Victoria awkwardly laughed and said, "Thank you."

"Do we have to be so formal with each other?" Samuel asked.

His deep, rich voice, filled with a charming huskiness, made Victoria's cheeks flush.

She lowered her eyes, avoiding Samuel's gaze, a reaction he didn't miss.

Victoria's ears were red, like a ripe cherry, particularly enticing.

Samuel suddenly felt his throat dry. He swallowed as heat surged within him, urgently needing to be quenched.

He couldn't help but lean closer to Victoria, his hot breath brushing against her face.

###chapter 53 My Parents Want to Meet You

Victoria suddenly looked up and locked eyes with Samuel, her heart doing a little flip.

Samuel caught her panicked look and a mischievous glint appeared in his eyes. He leaned in closer, his warm breath tickling her face.

Victoria instinctively tried to back away, but Samuel moved even closer, pinning her against the car window with nowhere to go.

"Samuel, what are you doing?" Victoria's voice wavered, and she felt the mix of tobacco and his body wash scent surrounding her.

His presence was overwhelming, and she felt like she was drowning in a sea of fire.

Samuel didn't say a word, just placed a gentle kiss on her forehead.

Victoria was stunned, her mind going blank.

It wasn't until Samuel pulled back that she snapped out of it.

"Samuel, you!" Victoria was at a loss for words.

Samuel gave a small smile and said softly, "Don't worry; I'm not going to rush you. Take your time. I've got plenty of patience."

Victoria hesitated for a moment before nodding, her cheeks turning pink.

Samuel then settled back in his seat, started the car, and headed towards Victoria's place.

He dropped her off at her apartment entrance.

Victoria got out of the car and turned to thank him.

Samuel grabbed a box of nutritional supplements from the trunk and handed it to her. "I've noticed you haven't been sleeping well, so I got these sleep aids for you. Make sure to use them."

Victoria was touched by his thoughtfulness. She pressed her lips together, took the box, and thanked him sincerely.

Just as she was about to leave, Samuel called out to her again.

"Oh, by the way, my parents are coming back soon. They heard their bachelor son finally has a love life and want to invite you to dinner. Would you be up for it?"

Victoria was caught off guard and was about to refuse, but Samuel quickly added, "No pressure. It's just that I've never had a girlfriend, and they keep questioning if there's something wrong with me."

He rubbed his temples in frustration.

Victoria couldn't help but laugh. After a moment, she nodded and agreed, "Alright."

Samuel smiled, a glint of satisfaction in his eyes.

They set a time to meet, and Samuel drove off.

As soon as Victoria walked through her door, her phone rang. It was Nora.

After a moment of hesitation, she answered.

Nora's cold, mocking voice came through, "Victoria, living the high life now and forgetting about me?"

Victoria frowned, her tone icy. "If you're calling to give me grief, I'm hanging up."

"Don't you dare!" Nora snapped, "I'm your mother! Have you no conscience?"

Victoria sneered, "Conscience? Mom, do you remember what you and Bobby have done recently?" Her voice cracked.

Nora was silent for a moment before recovering.

"Those were just minor things. Why are you being so petty? We're family."

"Locking me in the basement," Victoria said, her voice dangerously low, "almost killing me and subjecting me to online harassment. You call those minor things?"

Nora was speechless.

Victoria took a deep breath, trying to keep her anger and sadness in check. "What do you want from me today?"

Victoria had lost all hope and just wanted to know what Nora had to say.

Nora hesitated for a moment before slowly saying, "The hospital is demanding payment."

Victoria knew that Nora only ever contacted her for money, but she still held onto a tiny sliver of hope.

Unfortunately, Nora was still the same.

Thinking of this, Victoria hung up the phone.

Nora, hearing the busy tone, angrily threw her phone on the ground, shattering the screen.

Victoria actually hung up on her!

Fuming, Nora cursed, "Ungrateful brat, even a dog would be more grateful than you."

A nurse entering the room heard Nora's sharp curses, knowing instantly they were directed at Victoria.

They said women could empathize with women.

But Nora, as a mother, was beyond heartless and unfair.

She had been staying in a high-end VIP hospital room for months, all paid for by Victoria.

Yet every time Victoria visited, she never received a kind word.

But Nora was always attentive and caring towards Bobby, who constantly asked her for money.

Victoria had been hospitalized several times, and Nora acted as if nothing had happened, completely indifferent.

The nurse thought that if it were her, she would have gone mad long ago.

A mother like that?

Though the nurse was silently cursing, she still picked up the phone and placed it on the bedside table.

"Ms. Adams, are you alright?" she asked.

Nora glared at her and snapped, "Why so much nonsense! Give me my medicine!"

The nurse rolled her eyes, handed Nora the medicine bottle, and reminded her, "Ms. Adams, the medical fees your daughter paid for you have all been used up. If you don't pay the remaining fees in the next few days, we'll have to discharge you."

Hearing this, Nora immediately got angry.

She retorted, "What do you mean? Are you saying I can't afford to pay?"

However, the nurse shrugged and said nothing.

Nora, furious, pointed at the nurse and yelled, "Get out now!"

The nurse, uninterested in arguing, left the room.

The room fell silent, and Nora, clutching the medicine bottle, was seething with anger.

She had no choice but to call Victoria again.

At that time, Victoria was focused on revising her competition entry. When she finally checked her phone, she saw that Nora had called numerous times.

She rubbed her temples and redialed. "Victoria, are you crazy?!" Nora's voice exploded through the phone. "Why didn't you answer my calls?"

Victoria replied, "I have no money. I can't help you."

"How dare you speak to me like that?" Nora shouted, "I'm being mistreated here. The nurses look at me like I'm a plague, afraid I'll stick around! Victoria, can you really bear to see me kicked out of the hospital and die?"

"I told you, I have no money. Don't you understand?" Victoria was also angry.

She had tolerated Nora enough, but Nora kept pushing, thinking she was easy to bully.

Hearing this, Nora was momentarily speechless, but she didn't believe Victoria.

After all, Victoria's sugar daddy was William from the Scott family, a billionaire family.

How could she have no money?

She was just angry and didn't want to help.

But Nora knew Victoria was decisive and strong-willed, not afraid of confrontation.

Nora took a deep breath, trying to calm her anger, and gently persuaded, "Victoria, even if you're mad at me, you can't ignore your father. The house has been auctioned off. If he knew I was kicked out of the hospital and homeless, how heartbroken would he be?"

Victoria laughed coldly, mocking, "The luxury apartment Bobby lives in was secretly bought by you in his name, right? Why don't you move in with him?"

Nora's heart skipped a beat at Victoria's words.

###chapter 54 Don't Blame Me for Being Ruthless

She kept this matter very secret. When she found out that Alvin was in trouble, she quietly sold her jewelry and exchanged it for gold bars.

After the fuss had died down, she used the money to buy an apartment in the center of Silvermist City, making it convenient for Bobby to attend school.

She thought she had been very discreet. Even when she was hospitalized and had no money, she didn't use it. Who knew that Victoria found out?

Nora felt extremely guilty.

She stammered in rebuttal, "What nonsense are you talking about? How could I have such skills!"

Victoria sneered, she had guessed that Nora wouldn't want to admit it.

Victoria didn't say anything, and Nora pitifully said, "Victoria, are you really going to ignore me?"

A trace of mockery flashed in Victoria's eyes.

This is Nora, always taking and never giving!

Nora said many nice things, but Victoria remained unmoved. She had long lost her patience with Nora's act and was well aware of her cold-hearted nature.

She decided to break off with her, "Mom, you took that one million dollars from me when you tricked me into signing the settlement agreement with Ella without any guilt. Bobby betrayed me and helped Ella cyberbully me, he must have received a lot of money too, right? Now you come to me for money; do you think it's appropriate? Do you really think I'm a bank, giving you money whenever you want?"

By the end, Victoria's heart, which had already turned cold, still ached.

Hadn't she decided to live her own life and not be sad for unworthy people anymore?

Why did she still feel heartbroken and upset when she heard Nora's words!

Victoria closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, her expression had returned to indifference.

"I have no money for you, figure it out yourself."

"You!"

Nora's face turned red with anger.

After a while, she took a few deep breaths to calm herself, then said in a deep voice, "Victoria, considering our mother-daughter relationship, as long as you obediently pay my medical bills, I won't make things difficult for you. But since you are so ungrateful, don't blame me for being ruthless. 

"I'll give you three days. If you don't pay the remaining medical bills, I'll expose your sexual relationship agreement with William online, let everyone see how disgraceful Joshua's student is. By then, not only will you be ruined, but your teacher's reputation will be destroyed."

After saying this, Nora couldn't wait to hang up the phone, afraid that Victoria would continue to pester her.

Victoria stared at the phone screen, her eyes filled with anger.

She gripped the phone tightly, trembling all over, and slowly slid down to the floor by the window.

Her eyes reddened, and tears kept falling down her cheeks.

She looked up at the window.

At this moment, the sky was overcast, dark clouds covered the entire city.

The rain became more violent, with large raindrops hitting the window glass.

She sat there in a daze, letting the rain soak her clothes.

After a long time, she finally cried out, "I am also your child, why have you never considered me! Why do you treat me like this!"

After hanging up the phone, Nora let out a long sigh.

She actually didn't want to break off with Victoria, after all, since Alvin went to prison, it had always been Victoria who supported her.

Offending her wouldn't end well for herself either.

But since Victoria was so unyielding, she had no choice but to use extreme measures.

However, she didn't really want to completely break off with Victoria.

If Victoria was determined not to pay this time, she couldn't really expose her, that would be like shooting herself in the foot.

Nora bit her lip, then dialed another number.

Although she didn't want to be threatened by Nora, Victoria was very afraid that she would really expose her scandal online.

She would do anything for money!

If only she was exposed, it wouldn't matter much, after all, she had long been considered lowly.

But now she was seen as Joshua's student, if her relationship with William was exposed, Joshua's reputation would also be damaged!

This was something Victoria absolutely couldn't allow to happen!

After thinking all night, Victoria decided to go to the hospital and pay Nora's bill.

Seeing her haggard face, the nurse who had been scolded by Nora quickly pulled her aside and whispered, "You're here to pay your mom's bill, right? No need, it's already paid."

Victoria was stunned, "How is that possible? Did she pay it herself?"

Did she have a change of heart and decide to spend her own money?

The nurse rolled her eyes, "Of course not, it was someone else."

Victoria was even more puzzled, "Who?"

The nurse sighed dramatically, "It was Mr. Scott!"

"William?"

The nurse nodded affirmatively, "Yes, who else but Mr. Scott could afford to pay a year's hospital bill in one go; it's nearly a million dollars!"

After saying this, she gave Victoria a jealous look and walked away muttering.

Listening to the nurse's complaints, Victoria stood frozen in place.

It really was William.

She stormed over and pushed open Nora's hospital room door.

Nora was leisurely lying on the bed looking at her phone.

Seeing Victoria come in, she was startled, quickly locked her phone, and turned to Victoria, frowning, "You still know to come?"

Victoria ignored Nora and questioned, "Do you have any shame, letting William pay your hospital bill?"

Hearing this, Nora immediately got angry.

She quickly stood up, pointed at Victoria, and shouted, "If you had paid it, would I have had to lower my dignity to ask him?"

Victoria sneered, "So it's all my fault?"

Nora choked, "If it's not your fault, is it mine? If you had been filial, would I have had to beg William?"

She spoke so righteously, as if it was really Victoria's fault.

Victoria was so angry at her shameless words that she trembled all over.

Nora, as if not seeing this, continued, "Besides, you've been sleeping with him for so long, if this were ancient times, you'd be his concubine. I'm practically his mother-in-law, isn't it only right for him to pay for his mother-in-law?"

Victoria, enraged, stepped forward and swept the kettle and cups off the table, smashing them to pieces.

The loud noise startled Nora, leaving her stunned.

When she came to her senses, she glared at Victoria and raised her hand to slap her, "How dare you act out in front of me!"

"Stop!"

Just as Nora's hand was about to touch Victoria's face, a deep, cold male voice reached their ears.

###chapter 55 Don't Interfere with My Family Affairs

Nora's movements froze upon hearing the words.

She suddenly turned her head to look at the man, her expression changing.

Victoria was slightly stunned and slowly looked towards him.

William was wearing a dark wool coat, which made his face appear even more noble and handsome, with features as sharp as if carved by a knife.

He walked straight up to Nora and Victoria with his long legs, looking down at Nora. "You dare to hit my woman?"

His tone was very light, but the strong aura he exuded was terrifying.

Nora was so scared that she shrank back and instinctively took a step back.

William glanced at Nora's reaction, his eyes full of mockery.

Nora swallowed nervously and said, "I, I didn't mean to hit Victoria."

Victoria pressed her lips together, said nothing, and silently lowered her head.

William's gaze shifted to her, and his thin, sexy lips moved slightly. "Come with me."

Victoria sneered, looked at William and Nora with disdain, and walked out.

"Victoria! Where are you going?" William frowned and called out to her.

Victoria stopped and looked back at him.

She said coldly, "It's none of your business, Mr. Scott. I'll go wherever I want."

With that, she quickly left the ward without looking back.

Watching her leave, William was furious.

Victoria was truly ungrateful.

Nora saw William's increasingly ugly expression and said mockingly, "My daughter is just cheap, easily getting carried away. If you're nice to her, she not only doesn't appreciate it but becomes even more arrogant. Don't spoil her too much, or she won't know her place."

William said nothing, turned to glance at Nora, his eyes extremely indifferent. "I like spoiling her. It's none of your business."

With that, William pushed the door open and left.

Nora stood there, gritting her teeth in anger.

Victoria didn't leave, standing at the hospital entrance waiting for William.

After about three minutes, a Rolls-Royce Phantom drove steadily up and stopped beside her.

The window rolled down, revealing William's handsome face.

"Get in."

Victoria didn't hesitate, opened the door, and got in.

The Rolls-Royce drove through the streets, where neon lights flashed constantly.

Victoria looked at the changing street scenes, her voice hoarse. "William, you should know how deep the grudge between my mom and me is. I won't have anything to do with you because of her, so please don't interfere in my family's affairs anymore."

As she spoke, Victoria suddenly stopped, turned her head, and looked at William with determination.

William found her pretense of calmness amusing.

She seemed like a little kitten trying to act like a big tiger, both harmless and rather adorable.

Considering her completely indifferent mother, Nora, he understood why she had to put up defenses to protect herself.

It was hard to tell whether to sympathize or pity her.

Not hearing William's response, Victoria couldn't help but raise her eyebrows and asked again. "Will you agree or not?"

William collected his thoughts, turned his head, and stared at her seriously. "Victoria, you think too highly of yourself. If it weren't for your father..."

He suddenly stopped talking.

Victoria couldn't understand how it related to Alvin.

Could it be that William not only knew about Alvin from the news but also had some private dealings with him?

Thinking of this possibility, she became wary, her breathing gradually becoming rapid.

She clenched her fists, trying to maintain a calm expression, and tentatively asked, "What about my father?"

William didn't want Victoria to know about his grudge with Alvin, so he casually said. "If it weren't for your father causing so many deaths, I wouldn't hate the Carter family so much. Who knew you would satisfy me in bed, unlike any other woman..."

Before he could finish, Victoria's chest heaved with anger, and she gritted her teeth. "You bastard!"

William ignored her curse and continued, "Your mom threatened me on the phone, saying if I didn't pay her medical bills, she would expose our relationship online. I don't care, every rich kid has some scandals, right? But you, if this news gets out, can you still work at the gallery? I did you a big favor, and you curse me instead of thanking me. Is that how you treat your benefactor?"

He spoke lightly, but Victoria was furious.

He was blatantly threatening her, forcing her to submit!

"You should know, your mom is staying in the most luxurious hospital room, using the best medicine and living supplies, plus various nutritional and skincare products..."

Victoria knew William wasn't exaggerating.

Nora had lived in luxury since childhood, and even after marrying Alvin, she used the best of everything.

Even after Alvin went to prison, Nora was protected well, never suffering from the Carter family's bankruptcy.

Seeing Victoria's face darken, William continued. "I'm a businessman, spending so much money, do you think it's for charity? And I've paid off the debts your dad left behind. I can let the principal slide for now, but you should at least cover the interest each month-it's no small sum."

Victoria gritted her teeth. "I'll pay the interest myself every month!"

William sneered, "I've been paying the interest for you, you might not know. Over a hundred thousand dollars a month. How much did you earn this month? Two thousand dollars? How will you pay? Find another sugar daddy?"

Victoria's eyes reddened.

Seeing his goal was almost achieved, William smiled in satisfaction.

He turned his head, glanced at her casually, and reminded, "Of course, you can choose not to pay. But your father's sentence will..."

"Enough!" Victoria growled, her eyes red.

William stopped, and said indifferently, "Don't think about Samuel or Joshua, stay with me, and I won't treat you badly."

Victoria clenched her fists, her eyes filled with tears, glaring at William.

Seeing her pitiful yet pretending to be strong, William's long-suppressed desire stirred again.

He instructed Harry, the driver, "Drive to the riverside."

Harry was slightly stunned, then respectfully responded, "Yes."

Victoria's eyes widened in shock.

"What are you doing?" she exclaimed.

"You'll know soon." William smiled wickedly.

Victoria's heart raced, she looked ahead in panic, and when the car slowed down, she even thought of opening the door to escape.

William reached out and pulled her back.

Victoria was forced into his arms, his unique male scent filled her nose, making her shiver.

She struggled desperately, but William didn't let go.

Harry parked the car on a deserted riverside path, turned off the engine, and got out.

The car's interior was narrow and cramped; his warm breaths sprayed on her neck, sending shivers down her spine.

###chapter 56 Is This What You Call a Bastard?

Victoria was so scared that she didn't dare to move.

The only thing she was grateful for now was that there was only one dim light on this small path, and no one was paying attention to this side.

She clutched the seatbelt tightly and trembled, saying, "William, you can have any woman you want, just let me go, okay?"

William pinched her tender chin, lifted her face, and looked at her with a half-smile.

"I've had countless women trying to win my affection over the years, but you're the only one who's made me crave more. So, what should I do?"

Victoria shook her head to refuse his touch, her eyes filled with glistening tears.

William squinted his eyes and leaned close to her ear, lightly licking her sensitive earlobe, his hoarse voice full of magnetism, "We've done it so many times already, why do you still pretend to be so pure?"

His tone was ambiguous, filled with intense desire.

Victoria only felt her ears itch, her whole body becoming even more rigid.

"Let go of me! Let go of me!" Victoria twisted her body, pushing William in front of her with all her might.

William pressed her down, mercilessly blocking her mouth, wantonly biting her lips.

His kissing skills were skilled and domineering, with an aggressiveness that Victoria couldn't resist, causing her to moan involuntarily.

The more she struggled, the more William intensified his actions. Her arms felt like they were tightly bound by iron, unable to break free from him.

Victoria's legs had long lost their strength, slumping against the seatback, allowing William to suck her lips.

William pressed her down on the seat, his large hand wandering and caressing her slender waist, touching her curvaceous body through the thin fabric.

"Indeed, your body suits my taste better."

William murmured in a low voice, lowering his head to kiss her soft collarbone, following her curves downwards, finally landing on her chest.

Victoria struggled to push his shoulders, "Get off me, don't touch me!"

As soon as Victoria spoke, William's thumb pressed against her lips, stopping her from continuing.

His tongue licked the skin on her chest, the tingling sensation spreading throughout her body, making Victoria involuntarily arch her body and softly moan.

He chuckled, his fingers threading through her long hair, easily pressing her against the seatback, while his other hand slid to her buttocks, kneading them twice, teasingly saying, "Baby, your butt is really perky."

Victoria felt hot all over, even her ears turning red.

She was both ashamed and angry, her cheeks flushed red, and she stomped hard on William's foot, shouting angrily, "Bastard!"

Her voice was charming and seductive, combined with her current embarrassed and angry expression, it was truly captivating.

A strange light flashed in William's eyes, and he chuckled, "Is this what you call a bastard?"

With that, he unzipped his pants, revealing his hideous and ugly penis.

He lifted Victoria onto the back seat of the car, pressing down on her, and tore off her panties.

Victoria shamefully closed her eyes, feeling utterly hopeless.

William stared at her flushed, moist eyes, a gleam flashing in his eyes. He held her waist with one hand, half-lifting her up.

"Don't do this!" Victoria screamed.

William sneered, "Don't do this? You've done this plenty of times before."

Before he finished speaking, he thrust into Victoria's body, pounding vigorously.

Victoria cried out in pain.

"Relax a bit, baby, you're squeezing me so tight I might release right away," William panted.

"William, get off me!" Victoria bit her lower lip hard, her hands pounding on William's shoulders and back.

William ignored her, continuing his frenzied thrusts.

"Don't you like this?"

As he asked, his fingers deftly unhooked Victoria's bra, grabbing her ample breasts and squeezing them hard.

"Let go of me!" Victoria screamed.

"No! You're always pretending."

With that, he thrust a few more times.

Victoria bit her lip, trying hard to suppress the moans rising from deep in her throat.

William's movements became more intense, sweat beading on her forehead. She gripped the seat cushion tightly, unwilling to submit.

He suddenly grabbed her waist, thrusting deeply.

Victoria felt an intense pleasure like an electric current sweeping through her body, making her tremble uncontrollably, "Let go of me."

She cried out, but her voice was swallowed by his kiss.

William thrust forcefully, as if trying to penetrate her body.

Her body instantly collapsed, limp on the car seat.

Her body had long adapted to his presence, she could keenly sense his every move.

"Moan for me," William commanded, continuing to thrust into her.

Victoria felt dizzy, her vision blurred, her body convulsing uncontrollably, "William, please, let go of me, please..."

William continued to possess her, admiring her intoxicated expression, "How does it feel, isn't it great?"

"No, no more..." Victoria's tightly strung nerves suddenly snapped, waves of intense pleasure washing over her, making her faint again, only soft whimpers escaping her lips.

William was extremely satisfied with her unbearable expression, lowering his head to kiss the corner of her lips.

"Baby, let's change positions, you're too tired, you need a break."

With that, he suddenly flipped over, placing Victoria on top of him, making her lie on his body.

William held her waist, making her lie more comfortably.

Victoria felt her whole body burning, her rationality long gone, only William's scorching body temperature reminding her of what they were doing.

William's deep, magnetic voice sounded in her ear, "Don't be afraid, I'll be gentle."

He moved his body slowly, thrusting into her tender spot.

Victoria felt like her body was about to explode, she couldn't help but whimper, her hands flailing, "Don't, please, I beg you."

Unfortunately, it was all in vain.

William ignored her, focusing on enjoying the wonderful sensation of Victoria beneath him.

He grabbed her long, slender legs, thrusting hard, each time making Victoria climax uncontrollably, convulsing.

Her performance pleased William, he suddenly withdrew, then re-entered her body, each thrust more ruthless than the last.

When he finally released, it was two hours later.

Victoria lay exhausted on the back seat, her eyes red, her face pale, clearly having spent all her energy.

Seeing this, William frowned, reaching out to smooth her furrowed brows.

"Are you that tired?"

Hearing this, Victoria lifted her head, staring at him blankly, saying nothing.

"Looks like you need some rest, so I'll let you off tonight." William said, taking out a wet wipe to clean her up, then slowly dressing her.

After tidying up, he sent a message to Harry, who was keeping watch at the intersection, telling him to take a cab home.

Then he drove Victoria back to her apartment.

Victoria expressionlessly was about to open the car door when she suddenly heard William call her, handing her a bright red invitation.

She took it doubtfully and opened it.

It was William and Ella's wedding invitation.

###chapter 57 Being Her Bridesmaid

"Congratulations, Mr. Scott. Best wishes to you both," she said indifferently, her tone flat.

William squinted slightly, "What, aren't you even a bit jealous?"

"Jealous? Why?" Victoria retorted.

What right did she have to be jealous, especially because of him? 

A mocking smile appeared on William's lips, "You really are carefree."

"Thank you for the compliment," she replied neither humbly nor arrogantly.

"In that case, you won't refuse to be Ella's bridesmaid, will you?" William raised an eyebrow.

Victoria was stunned for a second, then angrily said, "She's crazy, but I'm not! Do I look like a foolishly over-kind person? She's harmed me so many times, and she still wants me to be her bridesmaid! Not a chance!"

She knew exactly what Ella was thinking.

She just wanted to use the wedding to humiliate her.

William laughed, "Do you think you have the right to refuse?"

Victoria pressed her lips together and said nothing.

"The wedding is next week. I'll send someone to pick you up for the bridesmaid dress fitting tomorrow," William continued.

After he finished speaking, he stepped on the gas, and the car drove out of Victoria's sight, leaving only a trail of exhaust.

Victoria sat there for a long time before coming back to her senses, looking at the wedding invitation in her hand, feeling a mix of emotions.

The next morning, William indeed sent Harry to pick her up.

In the car, Harry hesitated, finally unable to hold back, "Ms. Carter, you and Mr. Scott..."

"Call me Victoria!" Victoria interrupted him indifferently.

Harry hesitated for a moment, "Victoria, actually Mr. Scott still cares about you."

"Cares? Does he have the time to care about me?" Victoria sneered.

"When you were locked in the basement by Ms. Garcia, it was Mr. Scott who found you first and took you to the hospital."

"He saved me, but I haven't forgotten how I ended up in that situation. Harry, you should know better than anyone what I've been through because of William."

Victoria looked coldly out the window, "I just hope that after he gets married, the two of them won't bother me anymore!"

Harry sighed and tried to comfort her, "Victoria, you have every right to be angry. If it were my sister, I'd probably want to fight them too. But Mr. Scott is also quite pitiful; his parents died years ago..."

"Enough," Victoria coldly interrupted him, not wanting to hear about William, "I know his parents died early, but what does his pitiful situation have to do with me? Just because he lost his parents, does that give him the right to bully me?"

"Victoria..." Harry took a deep breath, wanting to say more.

But they had already arrived at the bridal shop.

Victoria opened the car door and got out, walking towards the bridal shop without looking back.

This bridal shop was the best in Silvermist City, featuring top luxury brands from around the world, worth a fortune.

Victoria stood in front of the display window, lost in thought.

Inside the window were various exquisite and beautiful wedding dresses.

There were traditional ones, innovative designs, and more.

Victoria's gaze swept over the beautiful wedding dresses one by one, but she felt nothing.

At this moment, a female sales assistant approached and asked kindly, "Miss, you are so beautiful, you would look good in any wedding dress. Would you like me to recommend one for you?"

Victoria shook her head and said indifferently, "I'm not here to buy a wedding dress; I'm here to try on a bridesmaid dress. Where is Ms. Garcia?"

"Please follow me," she led Victoria upstairs.

Victoria walked into the VIP room, her expression slightly stunned.

Inside the room, Ella and William were sitting closely on the sofa, chatting.

In front of them were a dozen luxurious wedding dresses, each worth a fortune.

Ella was choosing styles while discussing with William, "William, what do you think of this one?"

William glanced at it and nodded, "It's nice."

"What about this one?"

"It's fine too."

Ella was a bit unhappy, pouting and complaining coquettishly, "William, you're always so perfunctory. You didn't even look closely."

William affectionately tapped her playful nose, "Alright, I'll look carefully. How about this one?"

Ella smiled contentedly, "Okay, I'll try it on."

She was about to ask the assistant to take it down for her to try when she turned and saw Victoria standing in front of her.

She froze for a moment, then snorted disdainfully, "You actually came."

Victoria glanced at her expressionlessly and said coldly, "Didn't you ask me to be your bridesmaid? Ms. Garcia, if you're unhappy, I can leave right now."

"You!" Ella glared at Victoria angrily.

The reason she asked Victoria to be her bridesmaid was to make this bitch see her place.

Ella was the rightful Mrs. Scott of the Scott family, William's legitimate wife.

And Victoria was just a lowly mistress.

She was about to lose her temper when William stopped her, "Ella, our big day is coming up. Why get upset over someone irrelevant?"

"William, you spoil her too much; that's why she's so arrogant."

"Alright, go try it on," William urged, then imperceptibly cast a quick look at Victoria.

Although Ella was unhappy, she followed William's instructions and went into the fitting room.

Victoria didn't even look at William, casually finding a corner to sit down.

In no time, Ella came out of the fitting room wearing a beige lace strapless wedding dress.

William's eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but praise, "Not bad, it suits you well."

He wasn't just being polite; he genuinely thought the dress suited Ella. Her wheat-colored skin, combined with the strapless and backless design, made her skin look even more radiant.

Ella was very confident in her figure. Hearing William's praise, she proudly glanced at Victoria and said modestly, "Thank you, William. Now wait for me; I'll go try on the bridal makeup."

Before leaving, she told the assistant, "Pick out a few bridesmaid dresses for Ms. Carter. Remember, Ms. Carter is very conservative, so don't make them too revealing."

As she spoke, she deliberately glanced at Victoria's chest with a malicious look.

Victoria clenched her fists, barely restraining her anger from tearing Ella's hateful face apart.

Ella then strutted off to the makeup room in her dress.

The assistant brought a few bridesmaid dresses for Victoria and then went about her business.

Victoria took the dresses and went into the fitting room, changing into one of the bridesmaid dresses.

As she tied the belt of the bridesmaid dress, a pair of long, straight legs suddenly appeared in the mirror.

Victoria was startled and turned around abruptly, only to meet William's amused gaze.

###chapter 58 Your Fiancée Is Outside

"What are you doing!" Victoria whispered sharply, staring at him warily, "Get out now!"

Her voice was very low, afraid that people outside would hear.

William not only didn't leave immediately but instead watched with great interest.

Victoria followed his gaze and looked down-

It was a light gray bridesmaid dress, with a well-tailored, form-fitting design that highlighted her slender and delicate curves, perfectly outlining Victoria's graceful figure.

Especially the fluffy fishtail at the hem of the skirt, which added a touch of playfulness and cuteness.

Victoria was very slim, but her chest was exceptionally full, as if naturally blessed.

Her already curvaceous figure now seemed even more shapely and alluring. 

"Have you seen enough!" Seeing that William's gaze hadn't moved away for a long time, Victoria was both ashamed and annoyed.

William's lips curled into a smile as he slowly approached her.

The unique male hormones instantly invaded Victoria, and she couldn't help but recall the intimate scene in the car yesterday.

His hot breath sprayed on her ear, and Victoria felt a sudden rush of sensation, as if her head was spinning.

William reached out and pinched Victoria's soft chin, forcing her to look up and meet his gaze.

Victoria's eyes were moist and sparkling.

William felt his heart skip a beat.

He leaned down and kissed Victoria's red lips, his warm and slippery tongue prying open her teeth, greedily savoring the sweet taste in her mouth.

Victoria was kissed until she was dizzy, almost losing her soul.

When she came to her senses, she immediately struggled.

"No!"

William grabbed Victoria's arm and pulled her into his arms.

His other hand clasped her slender waist, pressing her tightly against his chest.

Victoria's suppressed breathing turned into intermittent moans, sounding particularly subtle in the quiet room.

William pressed her against the wall, his large hand slowly moving down along her elegant collarbone.

A tingling sensation rose from her spine, and Victoria couldn't help but moan softly.

"Don't move!" William warned deeply, continuing to tease her.

"Stop, stop."

"If you move again, I'll make love to you right here." William threatened.

Victoria bit her lip, not daring to move.

She knew that if she dared to struggle again, William would really make love to her right here!

She closed her eyes in despair.

William's hand had already moved up from her thigh, and a cold touch made her shiver.

"No." Victoria pleaded, her voice already tinged with sobs, "Not here, there are people outside."

William ignored her and continued his actions.

Finally, William's hand touched Victoria's private part, and Victoria trembled all over, involuntarily clamping her legs.

William took the opportunity to explore, lingering in her depths.

Victoria was stimulated to the point of whimpering.

"Not here." She bit her lower lip hard, trying not to make any shameful sounds.

"Relax, I won't go in, just playing around."

His tone was extremely teasing.

Victoria bit her lip and didn't make a sound.

At this moment, the voice of a store clerk came from outside.

"Ms. Carter, do you need any help?"

Hearing someone knocking on the door, Victoria felt like she was reborn. She used all her strength to push William away, quickly tidied herself up, and opened the door as if nothing had happened.

The store clerk was stunned when she saw her.

Victoria's cheeks were flushed, and her eyes were evasive.

William, without any concealment, swaggered out of the fitting room as well. He slightly raised his chin, not even looking at the store clerk, and walked straight to the sofa to sit down.

The store clerk stood there awkwardly.

Seeing the two of them like this, what else was there not to understand?

She just didn't expect an affair to be so blatant.

She wisely pretended not to see anything.

Pulling out an awkward smile, she said, "Ms. Carter, Ms. Garcia's makeup is done. Do you want to try the bridesmaid makeup?"

"Okay." Victoria coughed lightly, covering the blush on her face, and followed the store clerk out.

William also got up and followed.

Ella stood on a round display platform, her wedding dress inlaid with countless diamonds, dazzling and eye-catching.

The hem of the wedding dress was embroidered with intricate patterns in silver thread, each pattern exquisite and elegant, luxurious and grand.

Ella wore delicate makeup, her hair styled into a beautiful bun, and with her bright face, it was hard to look away.

Even Victoria, who disliked her, had to admit that Ella in a wedding dress was indeed stunning.

Seeing Victoria and William come in together, Ella's originally smiling face instantly turned cold. She snorted lightly and turned her head away.

William stepped forward, extending his right arm to embrace her shoulder, "Very beautiful."

Ella was delighted to hear this, and her earlier displeasure vanished instantly.

She looked up at William, coquettishly asking, "William, how is it?"

William's lips curled into a doting smile, "Very good, choose this one, and pick a few more as backups."

Ella beamed, affectionately holding William's arm, ignoring Victoria on the side. .

After all, she was about to become the rightful Mrs. Scott, so why bother with a lowly mistress.

As they left the bridal shop, Ella wanted to ride in the same car as William, but William refused.

"Be good, I have to go back to the company for some work. You go home and rest first." William patted her cheek, smiling as he instructed.

Ella glanced at Victoria, although unwilling, she didn't say anything.

She obediently got into her car, and as the door closed, the smile on her face instantly disappeared, replaced by a heavy gloom.

That shameless bitch.

Ella floored the gas pedal, the roaring engine speeding past William and Victoria, kicking up a cloud of dust.

Victoria covered her nose, frowning as she glared in the direction Ella left.

William fanned the dust away and asked Victoria, "Going home? I'll take you."

Victoria shook her head, "No need, I can go back myself."

"Really?" William raised an eyebrow, his tone rising, "Are you angry?"

"I'm not angry." Victoria denied flatly.

"Then get in the car." William insisted.

Seeing William's firm attitude, Victoria hesitated for a moment, just about to agree, when a dark blue Bentley suddenly drove up, braking sharply in front of them.

The window slowly rolled down, revealing a handsome profile.

It was Samuel.

###chapter 59 The Wedding

William's expression suddenly turned cold, and his gaze became frighteningly icy.

Victoria asked in surprise, "Samuel, what are you doing here?"

Samuel's gaze swept over William and landed on Victoria's face.

With a faint smile, he said, "I have shares in this bridal shop. I heard you were trying on bridesmaid dresses, so I came to take a look."

A mocking smile appeared on William's lips as he coldly questioned, "Mr. Brown, a college professor, seems to have quite a big business."

Samuel smiled and said, "It's nothing much, just some small-scale businesses, nothing compared to the Scott family's vast empire."

William glanced at Victoria mockingly and said nonchalantly, "Mr. Brown is really modest."

Samuel couldn't be bothered to argue with him and turned to Victoria, speaking gently, "Victoria, get in the car, I'll take you home."

William's face grew even darker.

Victoria looked at William, then at Samuel, and finally got into Samuel's car.

William watched them leave, his face as dark as a stormy sky, exuding a terrifying gloom.

Harry drove over to pick him up.

William took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, took a deep drag, and exhaled the smoke.

He leaned back in his seat, squinting his eyes as he gazed into the distance.

After a while, he extinguished the cigarette and casually asked, "That Samuel is he from the Brown family in Prosperity City?"

Harry nodded, recalling, "Yes, he's the eldest son of the Brown family. The Brown family is one of the top wealthy families in Prosperity City."

William sneered, "Victoria sure knows how to hook up with the right kind of men."

Harry didn't say anything, just sighed silently.

The car drove steadily on the road.

Victoria sat in the passenger seat, staring out the window at the passing buildings, her expression dazed.

"Why aren't you talking?" Samuel turned his head, looking at her gently.

Victoria snapped out of her daze and smiled apologetically, "I'm a bit tired today."

Samuel nodded, "Why did you agree to be a bridesmaid for someone who hurt you?"

"It's actually a good thing," Victoria thought for a moment and said, "This way, my improper relationship with William will be completely over."

So this was Ella's real intention, to drag her, the hidden mistress, into the light, exposing her to everyone, leaving her with nowhere to hide.

Samuel didn't say anything, just tightened his grip on the steering wheel slightly.

Victoria smiled bitterly and continued, "Samuel, you probably know about the entanglement between William and me, right?"

Samuel was slightly stunned. Of course, he knew. He had investigated thoroughly and didn't care at all.

He just never mentioned it to protect Victoria's dignity.

Victoria lowered her eyes and said softly, "I did sell myself to William for money..."

"Victoria," Samuel interrupted her, "Don't overthink it."

Victoria pressed her lips together and looked up at him.

Samuel's face had a gentle smile, as if it could dispel the darkness of the world.

"I probably know more about what happened between you and him than you do, so you don't have to worry that I'll look down on you."

"Samuel."

Victoria was somewhat moved.

Samuel continued to smile, "Victoria, you were never the one at fault, so you don't need to feel guilty or blame yourself!"

Samuel's words struck a chord in Victoria's heart, and she smiled gratefully at him.

"Thank you."

Samuel parked the car by the roadside, touched her soft hair, and said with a full smile, "I just want you to be happy."

"Okay." Victoria nodded, tears streaming down her face.

Samuel reached out to wipe the tears from her cheeks and comforted her, "Don't cry, Victoria, you're the best girl."

Victoria nodded and smiled through her tears.

Seeing her smile, Samuel felt a stir in his heart, and his long-dormant desire began to awaken.

He couldn't help but gently stroke Victoria's delicate skin, causing a tingling sensation.

"Victoria." Samuel's deep, sexy voice sounded in her ear, his warm breath on her neck making her shiver involuntarily.

His warm palm brushed against her skin, leaving a trail of heat that seemed to radiate from a fireplace, spreading warmth throughout her body.

This unfamiliar yet familiar tingling sensation made Victoria's heart race.

She stiffly twisted her body, her eyes looking at Samuel in confusion, not understanding his intentions.

"Victoria."

Samuel leaned in close, his cool lips lightly brushing hers in a fleeting kiss.

Victoria froze, her mind blank!

Samuel actually kissed her!

Samuel withdrew his hand, his deep eyes gazing at her flushed, shy face, his voice hoarse and low, "Victoria, I always lose control in front of you."

Victoria, flustered, avoided his intense gaze and pushed him away, saying, "Samuel, I, I don't feel well, can you take me home quickly?"

Samuel looked at her flustered appearance and couldn't help but chuckle, "Alright, I'll take you home right away."

Victoria nodded.

The car soon arrived at its destination.

Samuel unbuckled her seatbelt and reminded her, "Get some rest and don't overthink things."

Victoria nodded, got out of the car, and closed the door.

After Samuel's car left, Victoria stood there for a long time.

Soon, it was William and Ella's wedding day.

Victoria hadn't slept well all night, her stomach burning, and her colitis flared up.

She endured the waves of pain and got into the car William sent to pick her up.

The wedding was held at a resort hotel in the suburbs.

The entire hotel was decorated for the wedding today.

The wedding setup was dreamy and romantic, clearly costing a fortune.

Victoria entered the bride's dressing room. Ella was having her makeup done while chatting and laughing with the other bridesmaids.

Ella looked radiant and full of joy, completely like a new bride.

Seeing Victoria in her bridesmaid dress, the others stopped talking and looked at her with disdain.

They were familiar with Ella and knew about Victoria's relationship with the groom, William.

Naturally, they didn't show her any kindness.

Victoria didn't mind and found a corner to stay quietly, enduring her stomach discomfort.

At that moment, someone else entered.

The newcomer was in her thirties, tall and slim, wearing a black fitted suit that accentuated her curves.

Ella greeted her with a smile, "Daisy, you're finally here!"

Her attitude was very enthusiastic, even fawning.

Hearing the voice, Victoria opened her eyes and saw the newcomer, stunned for a moment.

This woman, she seemed to have seen her before.

###chapter 60 Did He Threaten You?

Daisy Scott glanced at Ella without speaking, then looked at Victoria who was curled up on the sofa.

She walked over and stood in front of Victoria, looking down at her.

Victoria raised her head and met Daisy's cold gaze.

"Who are you?" Victoria asked, a hint of confusion flashing in her eyes.

"I am William's aunt, Daisy Scott. You must be Victoria," Daisy said indifferently.

"Hello, Ms. Scott" Victoria nodded politely.

Although she didn't know much about William, she was somewhat familiar with his family members.

"Come with me," Daisy said slowly, her voice carrying a hint of seriousness, "I have something to say to you alone."

Victoria hesitated for a moment, then followed her.

The other bridesmaids looked at each other and whispered, "Ella, who is that woman? She's so arrogant."

"That's William's aunt. She's in her forties and still not married, with a very bad temper."

Everyone exclaimed, "So she's William's aunt. No wonder she's so arrogant!"

"Just wait and see the show!" Ella said smugly, glancing in the direction Victoria had left, "Let's see how Victoria can keep up her arrogance today!"

"What show? Tell us quickly," the bridesmaids urged.

Ella smiled proudly, "Since William's parents died, Daisy has been taking care of him. You could say she's like half a mother to him. I've told her all about Victoria seducing William. Daisy is very strict with her principles and bottom line, and she hates sleazy women. Victoria is definitely in for a bad time this time."

Victoria followed Daisy to the lawn outside the hotel, under a dense sycamore tree. Daisy leaned against the tree trunk, her posture elegant and lazy.

"Ms. Scott," Victoria called out.

Daisy turned her face slightly, giving Victoria a faint glance, her expression indifferent and her gaze sharp, "Ms. Carter, please sit down."

Victoria obediently sat on the chair beside her.

Daisy also sat down opposite her, carefully examining her.

Victoria's skin was smooth and translucent, her features exquisite and beautiful, her brows full of liveliness and charm, especially her gem-like eyes, clear and bright.

Being stared at by Daisy's sharp gaze made Victoria a bit uneasy. She awkwardly tugged at the corner of her mouth, "Ms. Scott."

"You've grown up," Daisy suddenly said. Victoria felt a bit puzzled but still responded obediently.

Daisy looked into the distant blue sky and slowly said, "I attended your tenth birthday party. I still remember you wore a white puffy dress that day, with two pigtails on your head, looking very cute."

Victoria felt she had seen her somewhere before and now remembered that Daisy had appeared with Alvin at that time.

Nora had seen the two of them and angrily pointed at Daisy, saying, "Your dad is running away with that woman, and you still have the mood to celebrate your birthday."

Victoria knew that Nora and Alvin were going through a divorce at that time, but she didn't know the specific reason.

Hearing Nora say that, she really thought Alvin was having an affair and went up to try to drive Daisy away.

Then she was scolded. That was the only time Alvin had scolded her.

So Victoria remembered it very clearly.

"Are you a friend of my dad?" Victoria asked tentatively.

"You could say that," Daisy sneered, "You should ask your dad about the entanglements between us, as it involves your mom's privacy."

Hearing this, Victoria was even more certain that she had a close relationship with Alvin.

She pursed her lips and continued to ask, "So why are you looking for me..."

"Did you sleep with William?" Daisy interrupted, her tone strong and pressing.

She didn't like to beat around the bush.

Victoria was stunned for a moment, then nodded, "Yes."

Daisy's face instantly turned gloomy, "Did he threaten you?"

Victoria didn't know how to answer. It was indeed a threat.

But at the beginning, when she was desperate and borrowing money everywhere for Nora's illness, only William gave her a way out.

Although this way out was at the cost of her dignity, Victoria had to admit that William helped her.

Because it was the best choice at that time.

At least William was a handsome young man, not those greasy old men with big bellies.

Victoria lowered her eyes and thought for a moment, then slowly said, "It wasn't exactly a threat."

Daisy frowned slightly, "Victoria, I have some connections with your father, so I don't want to see you get hurt. William's thoughts and feelings towards you are not as simple as you think. He wants to..."

She paused, seemingly considering her words, then said, "In short, you should leave him as soon as possible and stop getting entangled with him."

Victoria didn't quite understand Daisy's words, but she knew they were for her own good.

"Thank you for warning me. He's getting married today, so I don't think we'll have much interaction in the future," Victoria said softly.

She didn't want to delve into it, as feelings couldn't be forced.

"That's good," Daisy smiled with relief and changed the topic, "Since you're his lover, why are you here as a bridesmaid for his fiancée today?"

Victoria was stunned, then shook her head and said bitterly, "Ella invited me."

Daisy was surprised, then frowned, "Is this a joke? It's not enough for William to bully you alone, he has to bring his fiancée to humiliate you too? Is there such a way to bully people?"

Victoria was about to say it was voluntary, but Daisy grabbed her hand and pulled her away, "Come on, I'll help you settle accounts with him!"

"Ms. Scott!" Victoria called out urgently, trying to stop Daisy, but unfortunately, she wasn't strong enough to break free.

William had changed into his groom's suit, a white suit that fit his tall and slender figure perfectly.

He hadn't put on any makeup, and his hair was the same as usual.

There wasn't much joy on his face, instead, he looked even colder than usual.

He stood in front of the mirror, picking up his tie, about to put it around his neck.

The door suddenly opened, and he turned his head.

Daisy stood at the door, pulling Victoria, her face full of anger.

William raised an eyebrow at her, then looked at Victoria behind her and couldn't help but smile, "How did you two get together?"

Daisy took a few steps forward, looking down at William, "William, how could you treat Victoria like this?"

"What did I do?" William raised an eyebrow nonchalantly, clearly not feeling any guilt for his actions.

"You still ask what you did?" Daisy stepped forward and grabbed his ear, gritting her teeth, "It's bad enough that you coerced a young girl, but you also made her be a bridesmaid. Do you really have to humiliate her like this? Is it very honorable to bully a helpless girl?"

###chapter 61 William, I'm Back

William gasped in pain, reaching out his left hand to block Daisy from grabbing his arm. "What nonsense are you talking about? When did I ever bully her?"

"Still denying it!" Daisy glared at him. "Your fiancée told me everything. She even exaggerated, describing Victoria as a gold-digger who clings to the rich and powerful. Does she think I'm as stupid as her and have no discernment at all?"

William's brows furrowed tightly, his face turning ashen.

He looked in Victoria's direction and saw her pale face, with beads of sweat on her forehead, seemingly frightened. A surge of irritation and anger rose in his heart.

He knew Ella was foolish, but he didn't expect her to be this foolish.

She even dared to tattle to Daisy.

Didn't she consider that Daisy, having been in the business world for so long, had encountered all kinds of people? How could she not see through her?

And she still foolishly thought she could use her eloquence to distort the truth?

How utterly stupid.

If it weren't for Alice...

Thinking of this, William sighed and patiently explained to Daisy, "Aunt Daisy, I neither hit her nor scolded her. How did I bully her? Just because her father..."

"Shut up!" Daisy glanced at Victoria and interrupted William. "Even if her father committed a crime, the law has already punished him. Do you want her to bear the consequences as well? You just find her pretty and are lusting after her. Don't give me so many excuses."

William helplessly rubbed his brow and sighed, "Aunt Daisy."

He wanted to say something to calm the furious Daisy.

Just then, Harry pushed the door open and, seeing the scene before him, paused for a moment before saying, "Mr. Scott, the bride is ready, and the officiant and guests have almost all arrived."

William responded, "Okay."

Then, Daisy let go of him, smoothed out her clothes as if there were wrinkles, gave him a cold look, and snorted, "Victoria will stay with me today. She won't be your bridesmaid anymore. You have so many bridesmaids; you won't miss one."

Hearing this, William frowned, his gaze falling on Victoria, remaining silent.

Daisy, pulling Victoria protectively, gave William a warning look before leading the pale Victoria out of the room and towards the lawn.

William watched their backs disappear from sight before turning to follow them out.

When Ella learned that Victoria had been taken away by Daisy and could no longer be her bridesmaid, she was not angry but extremely happy.

She thought Daisy disliked Victoria and had deliberately taken her away, which suited her perfectly.

Ella, fully dressed, lifted her skirt and walked down the red carpet, swaying her slender waist.

Her cheeks were flushed, looking stunningly beautiful, with a face full of happiness and joy.

She caught a glimpse of William coming out of the lounge and gave him a charming smile, calling out sweetly, "William."

Hearing her soft and seductive voice, William nodded expressionlessly.

Ella was already used to his hot-and-cold attitude and approached him, taking his arm as they walked towards the stage.

The wedding was held on the lawn, decorated with roses flown in from abroad, making it both romantic and luxurious.

Petals fell like rain, filling the air with a rich floral fragrance.

With flowers paving the way, William and Ella walked down the aisle, drawing everyone's attention.

By this time, the guests were already seated, most of them prominent figures from Silvermist City, along with some celebrities from the entertainment industry.

At William and Ella's wedding, only Daisy from the Scott family attended.

Most of the Scott family's influence was in Harborview City. William's grandfather was old and in poor health, so William didn't want to tire him out. He planned to visit him with Ella after the wedding.

As for Wayne's family, they mostly stayed abroad since William's parents died, only returning for holidays.

In essence, the Garcia family wasn't significant enough for them to pay much attention.

And William himself had no real affection for Ella, so he didn't give her much face.

Even if the Garcia family knew Ella was being slighted, they couldn't say much.

Victoria sat in the audience, her abdominal pain from enteritis causing her to break out in a cold sweat, forcing her to lean on Daisy's shoulder.

Daisy, feeling Victoria's body growing weaker, looked at her worriedly and asked softly, "Victoria, are you okay?"

Victoria shook her head.

Daisy touched her pale face, "Do you want me to take you to the hospital?"

"No, no need," Victoria refused, looking up at Daisy. "The wedding is about to start. It's not good to leave now."

If she left early, Ella might overthink it and cause trouble.

More importantly, she wanted to see William put the wedding ring on Ella with her own eyes. That way, she could completely let go of her hidden feelings.

William stood on the stage, his deep eyes scanning the surroundings before finally resting on Victoria in the corner.

Seeing her leaning on Daisy, looking uncomfortable, he couldn't help but curl his lips.

So, Victoria wasn't completely emotionless after all?

At least she felt bad seeing him get married.

After the wedding, he would go and comfort her.

William lowered his gaze and slowly looked away.

Ella, seeing William smile at Victoria, felt a pang of jealousy.

But at this moment, she knew to maintain her composure.

Despite her anger, she kept a gentle and graceful smile on her face.

"Please exchange rings, bride and groom!" The officiant's clear voice drew everyone's attention to William and Ella.

Ella, smiling brightly, extended her right hand to William.

William picked up a diamond ring and was about to put it on her when a distinctive phone ringtone sounded.

His movements suddenly halted. Ignoring Ella's displeased expression and the murmurs from the audience, he took out his phone and answered it.

Ella only heard a familiar voice from his phone. "William, I'm back."

Ella's pupils contracted, and her fingers clutching her wedding dress lost their color.

William's face also changed, and he jumped off the stage, discarding the groom's boutonniere as he quickly left.

"William!" Ella shouted, trying to make him stay, but before she could finish, William had already turned the corner and disappeared from her sight.

Ella stood frozen, watching William's departing figure. Her mind felt like it exploded, her vision darkened, and she fainted on the stage.

The voice on the phone just now was her sister Alice's.

###chapter 62 Finding an Chance

William's sudden departure caused a commotion among the audience, and the Garcia family was even more panicked, busy helping the unconscious Ella while calling the fleeing William, hoping he would come back quickly.

The other guests were even more talkative, with all kinds of speculations emerging.

"What happened?"

"Why did Mr. Scott leave suddenly? Could something have happened?"

"Who knows, maybe he ran away from the wedding?"

Daisy didn't expect such a change either, her face darkened as she looked at the chaotic wedding scene.

This William, still so unruly, dared to run away from the wedding at the last minute!

The Scott family's face has been completely lost by him!

Victoria also didn't expect William to leave suddenly.

She was stunned for a moment, then lowered her head and covered her stomach, the pain intensifying, making her groan a few times.

Daisy noticed Victoria's abnormality and quickly reached out to support her, nervously shouting, "Victoria, are you okay?"

Victoria gritted her teeth to endure the pain and shook her head at Daisy, "I'm fine, don't worry."

Daisy frowned, "You look terrible."

Victoria pressed her lips together without speaking, just feeling the pain getting worse, with fine beads of sweat appearing on her forehead.

Seeing her face getting paler, Daisy knew she couldn't delay any longer and immediately helped her up, "Let's go, I'll take you to the hospital."

Victoria was in so much pain that she couldn't speak, barely following Daisy out.

Along the way, they encountered many guests, but Daisy was in a hurry to take Victoria to the hospital and didn't bother to greet anyone, just kept supporting Victoria and hurriedly left.

William arrived at the airport, searching for that familiar figure among the bustling crowd.

Finally, in the lounge area, he spotted the person he had been longing for.

She was quietly curled up on a seat, looking at the passing crowd, her delicate face pale and bloodless, with long, thick eyelashes covering her eyes.

William felt a sharp pain in his chest, as if a blunt object had shattered his heart.

His feet felt like they were filled with lead, unable to move a step, just staring fixedly at that slender figure.

What happened to her? Why is she so weak? Is she sick?

His heart ached with pain.

Had she not been doing well abroad these past few years?

William approached her step by step, each step taken very slowly, as if it took all his courage.

Sensing someone approaching, Alice turned her head, and the first thing she saw was the well-dressed, handsome William.

"William!" Alice slightly parted her lips, revealing a sweet smile.

Her voice was soft and sweet, like a small brush gently scratching William's heart, making him feel a tingling sensation all over; he wished he could offer her the best things in the world just to see her smile.

William clenched his fists, trying to suppress the emotions surging in his heart, his gaze burning as he stared at her.

Looking at the tall William in front of her, Alice's cheeks turned red, and she shyly called out, "William, I'm back!"

"Welcome home." Seeing her smile, William felt his heart melt, just like years ago when she waited for him at the school gate to go home together.

Her smile was always as gentle and intoxicating as the spring breeze in March, making him unable to resist.

He thought of the days he spent with her, how she always loved to stick by his side and talk, like a little butterfly fluttering around his ears, infusing his dull life with new energy.

Those memories were so distant, so distant that he had forgotten how much he missed that time.

If it weren't for him back then, she wouldn't have suffered from kidney failure due to excessive drinking and wouldn't have left him.

William bent down and hugged Alice, his voice hoarse as he spoke, "Do you know how much I missed you?"

These words were like a sweet and mellow spring, flowing through Alice's heart, warming her entire being.

Alice's mouth curved into a happy, sweet smile, obediently nestling in his arms, softly responding, "I know."

"Then why didn't you come back earlier?" William lowered his head, staring at her intently.

"After all, we promised Ella back then." Alice was stunned for a moment, then raised her head, blinking her clear, bright eyes, and pouted aggrievedly, "But when I heard you were really going to marry her, I couldn't stand it! So I found a way to escape from the bodyguards watching me and came back. Look, I even sprained my foot."

She lifted her swollen left foot to show him, her bright, beautiful eyes filled with tears, looking at him pitifully, making him feel a surge of pity.

"I'm sorry, I misunderstood you." William's tone softened, as gentle as a feather brushing against the skin, "I'll take you to the hospital for a check-up now, okay?"

Alice nodded obediently, her eyes moist, "Okay."

William picked her up and walked to the parking lot, got into the Maybach, and sped towards the hospital.

Daisy had just arrived at the hospital with Victoria when they ran into the anxious Samuel.

Victoria was surprised to see him and asked, "Samuel, why are you here?"

Samuel looked at her pale face and said with concern, "Our bridal shop needs to keep following up with big clients and provide ongoing makeup services. The makeup artist told me you were being helped out of the venue, looking like you were sick, so I came to the nearest hospital to try my luck. What's wrong with you?"

"I just ate something bad, it's not a big deal." Victoria smiled bitterly; seeing Daisy looking at Samuel, she introduced, "Ms. Scott, this is Samuel Brown, my friend."

Samuel politely nodded to her and followed Victoria's address, "Ms. Scott, hello."

Daisy saw that although Samuel seemed much older than Victoria, he exuded an extraordinary and elegant aura, clearly not an ordinary person.

She nodded in satisfaction, thinking Samuel was much better than the unruly William.

That bastard William, if he continues to be so stubborn, he will regret it in the future.

And if that happens, it will be his own fault!

Seeing Victoria in so much pain, Samuel didn't bother with pleasantries and immediately carried her to the emergency room.

The doctor gave her a thorough examination and finally told Victoria that it was nothing serious, just a bit of gastroenteritis, and she just needed a few days of IV fluids.

Seeing that she was fine, Daisy instructed Victoria to rest well and then went home.

Samuel stayed by her side, patiently taking care of her.

His meticulous care made the nurses envious, sighing that older lovers are indeed more considerate!

Samuel bought some strawberries, washed them, and fed them to her one by one.

Victoria felt a bit embarrassed, blushing as she declined, "Samuel, I can do it myself."

Samuel picked one up and put it in her mouth, smiling, "I finally found a chance to be attentive to you, why not let me do it?"

Victoria's mouth was stuffed with a strawberry, her cheeks puffed out, just about to swallow it.

Then she saw William carrying a beautiful and fragile woman come in.

###chapter 63 I Will Compensate You

William wore a custom-tailored white suit that accentuated his broad and upright back. His features were stern, with sharp eyebrows and starry eyes.

His deep eyes, usually indifferent and distant, were filled with infinite tenderness and affection when he looked at Alice in his arms.

Alice, in his arms, was petite and delicate, with shoulder-length hair, smooth skin, and exquisite features. Her almond-shaped eyes sparkled with a captivating charm.

Her face was stunning enough to captivate anyone, and with just one glance, she could bewitch anyone.

Could it be that William ran away from the wedding because of this woman?

Wouldn't Ella be furious with her?

Thinking of Ella's radiant smile before the wedding and then seeing her faint from anger when William ran away, Victoria felt a mix of emotions and couldn't help but sigh.

She admitted that she was somewhat happy to see Ella humiliated, but as a woman, she also felt a bit of sympathy for her.

She knew how much Ella loved William.

To be humiliated by the person you love the most at your wedding, how desperate must that be?

William didn't expect to run into Victoria here. Seeing the IV in her hand and Samuel feeding her strawberries beside her, his handsome brows furrowed.

Alice noticed him stop and followed his gaze, seeing the young girl receiving an IV.

She was wearing a bridesmaid dress with a man's coat draped over her.

She looked delicate and pretty, with smooth skin, exquisite features, watery eyes, and pink lips. She appeared very fragile, like a doll.

However, her chest was full, especially her breasts, which subtly moved with her breathing, looking particularly enticing.

Pure yet seductive, she was the dream woman for any man.

The four of them exchanged glances, and the atmosphere momentarily froze.

Samuel looked at William and discreetly placed his arm behind Victoria, adopting a protective stance.

Victoria noticed but didn't reject it; instead, she leaned closer to him.

William withdrew his gaze, holding Alice as he walked towards Victoria. He glanced at her indifferently and said coldly, "Why are you in the hospital?"

Victoria bit her lip and remained silent for a moment before slowly saying, "Thank you for your concern, Mr. Scott. I just had an upset stomach."

Her attitude was neither humble nor arrogant, as if they weren't very familiar.

William then remembered that she had seemed unwell all day.

He had thought it was because he was getting married, but it turned out she had a stomachache.

Realizing this, he felt he had been assuming too much.

His expression grew colder, and he didn't even bother to look at her again. Holding Alice, he walked past them and continued forward.

Victoria heard Alice in his arms ask him, "Who is she?"

William replied nonchalantly, "She used to be an employee at my company, but she has resigned."

An employee?

Victoria found William's words somewhat amusing.

She endured the twisting pain in her abdomen, tightly pressed her pale lips together, and lowered her head.

Meanwhile, The Garcia Villa was already in chaos.

After Ella momentarily fainted from anger, Willow was about to take her to the hospital for a check-up.

However, Ella returned to The Garcia Villa without saying a word, locked herself in her room, and no matter how much Willow called, she didn't open the door.

"Say something! You're worrying me to death!" Willow paced anxiously outside the door.

She couldn't believe that little bitch Alice had managed to escape from the bodyguards and caused Ella such distress!

Unbelievable!

Alice's mother had given Willow a hard time back then, and now Alice had broken Ella's heart. Did they think they were easy to bully?

When Alice returned, she would definitely teach her a lesson.

Zachary sat on the sofa, his face dark with anger.

His son-in-law had run away from the wedding because of his other daughter. If this got out, the Garcia family's reputation would be ruined.

He was about to order someone to find Alice when the Garcia family's butler reported that Alice had returned.

Willow rushed to the door, ready to scold her, but when she looked up, she met William's cold gaze and was momentarily stunned.

Willow knew William's nature all too well. He was cold-blooded and ruthless, with no heart.

He loved Alice the most, and for others, even Zachary, he didn't care.

She didn't dare to scold anymore and closed her mouth awkwardly.

Zachary sighed when he saw William bringing Alice back.

He felt guilty about Alice's mother. If he hadn't cheated on her with Willow and had Ella, Alice's mother wouldn't have died of depression.

Even though Alice had ruined Ella's wedding, he couldn't bring himself to be angry with her.

"You're back," Zachary greeted calmly.

William responded and led Alice into the living room, sitting her on the sofa and comforting her softly, "It's okay, everything's fine."

Alice nodded, her eyes red as she nestled into his arms. She cautiously said to Zachary, "Dad, I'm sorry. It's my fault for causing you trouble."

As she spoke, tears streamed down her face.

William patted her back, soothing her trembling emotions.

"Alice, you bitch!" A furious shout came from the stairs, accompanied by the sound of high heels on the steps.

Ella stood on the stairs, pointing at Alice and cursing, "You knew today was my wedding with William, but you came back on purpose! You wanted to ruin our wedding, didn't you? You bitch, I'll kill you!"

She rushed forward to hit Alice.

William stood in front of Alice, grabbing Ella's swinging arm forcefully. His cold, harsh gaze swept over Zachary and Willow. "This is my fault. I'll make it up to you."

Ella was so angry that her lungs hurt.

She stared at him in disbelief, her voice sharp as she questioned, "Make it up? How? By having another wedding?"

William didn't answer, and Alice shook her head, sobbing, "I'm sorry, Ella. I can't give William to you. It's my fault. You can hit me or punish me, but please give William back to me. I'll do anything you want."

"You! You!"

Alice's every word was like a knife stabbing into Ella's heart. She suddenly took off her dress, leaving only her underwear, exposing her body to everyone.

She pointed to a scar on her stomach, crying out, "Alice, are you even human? I gave you one of my kidneys to get the engagement with William, and now you want me to give him back? What about my kidney? Will you give it back to me?"

###chapter 64 Give Me Back My Kidney

After she finished speaking, she broke down into hysterical sobs, crying so hard she could barely breathe.

Willow, feeling heartbroken, wrapped her arms around Ella's shoulders and draped a coat over her.

Speaking softly, Alice continued to cry uncontrollably.

Seeing this, Zachary sighed deeply, his voice light but filled with exhaustion and weariness, as if he had aged ten years overnight.

"It's my fault, I let Ella down, I broke my promise. Ella, if you really hate me, you can take your kidney back! I've made up my mind, even if I die, I won't let William go to you." Alice cried bitterly.

Ella was stunned, her eyes wide with shock, unable to believe that Alice could say something so shameless.

Her chest heaved with anger, and she pointed a trembling finger at Alice, saying, "You... you, you bitch, are you even human? Fine, you want to give it back to me, right?"

As she spoke, Ella grabbed a fruit knife from nearby and lunged at Alice.

Seeing this, William's expression changed, and he kicked Ella away.

With a loud crash, Ella fell to the floor, hitting her forehead on the corner of the coffee table, immediately drawing blood.

A wave of searing pain hit her, and Ella screamed in agony.

"Ella!" Willow screamed, rushing over to support her. "Are you okay, Ella? Does it hurt?"

Ella was in too much pain to speak, and Willow, panicking, pulled out her phone and dialed 911. "I need an ambulance, please help, my daughter is hurt!"

She cried out, her voice hoarse and heart-wrenching.

William glanced coldly at the blood-covered Ella, his brow furrowing, his gaze growing even colder.

Seeing his indifferent attitude, Willow became even more furious and shouted at Alice, "Alice, you damn bastard, if anything happens to her, I won't let you off!"

Alice's eyes filled with tears as she cowered beside William, silently wiping her eyes.

William pulled her into his arms, comforting her softly, "It's okay, I'm here."

Then he turned to Ella and said, "I said I would compensate you on her behalf. If you want ten million dollars, or even a hundred million dollars, just say the word; I can give it to you. But from now on, Alice owes you nothing."

Ella felt that the pain from her head injury was nothing compared to the pain William's words caused her.

She suddenly laughed, looking at William with a sorrowful expression, "William, I risked my life for you, and this is how you treat me? You keep humiliating and hurting me for this mentally unstable Alice..."

"Enough! Ella, stop talking! I don't care what you think." William couldn't hold back and interrupted her.

"Fine, I brought this on myself." Ella laughed bitterly, slowly getting up from the floor and heading upstairs.

Willow thought she was going to change clothes and quickly followed, "Sweetie, I'll go with you to change clothes."

William glanced in their direction and said to Zachary, "Mr. Garcia, Alice just got back, I'll take her to my place to rest for a while."

"Alright, go ahead." Zachary sighed helplessly, watching everything unfold.

William picked up Alice and strode out.

Just as they stepped out of the living room, a dark figure suddenly fell from above, landing in front of them.

Alice screamed in fright.

It was Ella!

She lay on the ground, half of her body stained with blood.

Willow looked down from the third floor, seeing Ella covered in blood, she was so scared that her legs gave out and she collapsed to the floor, unable to speak.

William pressed his lips together, squatted down to check on Ella.

After a moment, he said in a deep voice, "Take her to the hospital."

Alice stared blankly at Ella's horrific state, her eyes gradually turning blood-red.

A few days later, Victoria went back to the hospital for a follow-up as per the doctor's orders.

Afterward, she quietly peeked into Nora's room.

Although she had decided not to care about her anymore, she couldn't help but check on her condition.

The young nurse saw her and couldn't help but sigh, "Nora has such a good daughter, but she wasn't cherished. It's really foolish."

If anyone treated Victoria well, she would give her heart and soul in return.

The nurse stepped forward and led Victoria aside, "Ms. Carter, you don't need to worry too much. Your mother's condition is quite stable, and she has caregivers looking after her. You can rest assured."

"Thank you," Victoria nodded. "Please take good care of my mom."

"It's our duty," the nurse smiled.

Victoria was about to leave when the nurse stopped her and asked, "Ms. Carter, do you know someone named Ella?"

After all, the story of Victoria, William, and Ella was no secret in the hospital.

Victoria was taken aback, then nodded, "I know her."

The nurse continued gossiping, "She jumped off her house, did you know?"

"Jumped... jumped off her house?" Victoria's mind buzzed. Ella actually jumped off a building?

The nurse shook her head, "I don't know the details, but it seems she jumped from the third floor. Luckily, she fell into a flower bed, so her life isn't in danger, but she's seriously injured."

Victoria left the nurse's station in a daze.

She couldn't believe that Ella would have such a strong and impulsive nature, willing to jump off a building and risk her life.

How deep must her love be?

Victoria shook her head. No matter how deep the love, if you fell for the wrong person, it was destined to be a tragedy.

Moreover, doing this only brings pain to those who care and joy to those who hate.

People would be glad to see you gone, out of their way.

As Victoria took the elevator to the first-floor lobby, she saw Willow pushing Ella's wheelchair, waiting for the elevator.

Even though Victoria knew Ella was seriously injured, seeing her in this state still shocked her.

Ella's face was pale, her arms and legs wrapped in bandages, even her head and neck were covered in gauze.

Except for her face, she looked like a mummy.

Victoria stared at her, unable to react for a long time.

Ella also saw Victoria.

Her previously lifeless face suddenly filled with intense hatred. She glared at Victoria and cursed through gritted teeth, "Bitch! Are you here to laugh at me?"

###chapter 65 Alice Is a Lunatic!

Victoria immediately put away her slight pity for her.

Ella deserved this outcome entirely.

"Watching you make a fool of yourself? Ridiculous." Victoria's lips twitched as she mocked, "Do you think everyone's interested in you?"

"You..." Ella had just opened her mouth when a sharp pain surged through her body, causing her to groan in pain.

Willow quickly reached out to hold her, "Ella, what's wrong?"

Victoria couldn't be bothered to argue with her and lifted her foot to leave.

Seeing this, Ella hurriedly called out to her, "Victoria, I have something to say to you!"

Victoria stopped in her tracks, her back to Ella, and mocked, "What? Haven't you insulted me enough?"

Ella signaled Willow to push her wheelchair in front of Victoria.

Because it was a private hospital, there weren't many patients.

"Victoria, if I were you, I would never be a mistress hiding in the shadows. I would do everything I could to win him over and be his legitimate girlfriend!" Ella stared at Victoria with a vicious look.

Hearing this, Victoria squinted slightly, "Ella, you lost the man to someone else and now you want to incite me to get involved in this complicated mess, hoping to kill two birds with one stone? Do you think everyone is as stupid as you?"

"Do you dare say you haven't coveted him?" Ella sneered, "Do you think pretending to be pure and weak can hide your ugly desires?"

Victoria didn't deny it and retorted, "Compared to someone like you who loses their mind for love, I am indeed very smart, much smarter than you! And let me tell you, I have no interest in your William. If he hadn't forced me, I would have stayed far away from you two!"

Hearing this, Ella's face turned extremely ugly, "You're lying! If you weren't good at seducing men, why would William always be infatuated with you? As his fiancée, he has never touched me..."

"Shut up!" Victoria interrupted her coldly, "I have no interest in your relationship, nor do I want to get involved in your love triangle."

With that, she turned to leave.

"Do you think saying that will make her let you go?" Ella suddenly laughed, "Alice Garcia is a lunatic! As long as she knows you've been with William for so long, you won't have a good ending!"

Hearing this, Victoria stopped abruptly and turned to look at Ella.

Alice? Was she the woman William was holding that day?

Could she be Ella's sister?

Ella's expression was twisted and crazed as she spoke word by word, "My dear sister, who seems harmless and gentle, is actually terrifyingly vicious!"

As she spoke, she struggled to lift her clothes, revealing a horrifying scar to Victoria, "Look at this! This is the scar from when I donated a kidney to her! She promised that if I gave her my kidney, she would let me marry William. But as you saw, on my wedding day, she showed up and effortlessly took William away! Now I'm missing a kidney and being ridiculed by countless people because the groom ran away! And all of this was orchestrated by my dear sister!"

By the end, Ella was screaming hysterically.

Victoria listened quietly to Ella's accusations and finally spoke after a long pause, "I told you, I'm not interested in your affairs. Whatever you want to do is your business, don't drag me into it."

With that, she didn't linger any longer and walked towards the door.

Ella seemed to hear an extremely ridiculous joke, "Do you think you can stay out of it? Just wait, your end might be worse than mine."

Victoria ignored her and left directly.

Starry Studio Gallery recently took on a project to design the display for a newly opened home goods department store.

The owner of this building had always been a major client of Starry Studio Gallery, so Diana paid extra attention to this design, ensuring every detail was perfect.

Victoria, Wendy, and the other dozen employees of Starry Studio Gallery, along with the store staff, worked overtime for almost a month to get it mostly done.

Only minor adjustments were needed.

The building's owner also opened for a trial run, only for some VIP members.

Victoria had been on-site these days, recording and adjusting based on customer feedback and attitudes.

While she was working diligently, her phone kept ringing non-stop.

Annoyed, Victoria took it out and saw it was that idle rich kid again.

The rich kid's name was Alton Bridges, the son of the home goods department store's owner, and a college student.

A while ago, when he came to inspect the mall on behalf of his father, Diana assigned Victoria to accompany him and listen to his feedback.

After getting to know each other, Alton, for some reason, broke up with his girlfriend and started pursuing Victoria madly.

Every day, he sent flowers, food, and luxury goods non-stop, despite Victoria's constant rejections and polite indications that she wasn't interested in him.

But this guy was like velcro, impossible to shake off.

After the phone rang for a long time, it finally stopped.

Victoria breathed a sigh of relief.

Just as she was about to check the layout and decor of the hall for any needed adjustments, she saw Alton having someone carry 444 roses, standing in the center of the hall, shouting at her, "Victoria!"

Victoria was silent.

Everyone around was silent too.

"Oh my god, is this handsome guy confessing to this lady?"

"Of course! Who else would send 444 roses? It's so romantic!"

"So lucky!"

Victoria, however, didn't feel romantic or lucky at all.

She only felt extremely embarrassed.

She lowered her head, pretending not to see him, and used the blueprint to cover her face, wanting to leave this place quickly.

But the more she avoided him, the more persistent Alton became.

"Victoria! Victoria! The one in the brown coat, Victoria, look over here!" Alton waved his arms excitedly, shouting.

"Victoria, why don't you go over and talk to him?" Wendy teased, having heard the commotion, her eyes sparkling with anticipation to see Victoria's reaction.

Victoria glared at her and walked over helplessly.

"Victoria, do you like these roses?" Alton smiled brightly, showing his white teeth.

Victoria was overwhelmed by the strong floral scent and sneezed.

She quickly covered her nose, "Mr. Bridges, I can't accept these flowers, I'm really sorry."

"Don't be like that!" Alton looked at her with a face full of grievance, "I really like you."

Victoria sighed, "I'm sorry, you're not my type. Please give up."

Alton was stunned, then asked, "What type do you like?"

Victoria thought for a moment and decided to use Samuel's standards, "I like mature, steady, gentlemanly types who also appreciate art like I do."

And her words were all overheard by William, who was there with Alice to pick out furniture.

###chapter 66 Are You Victoria?

Alice moved into The Scott Villa.

But her home was filled with minimalist gray furniture.

It didn't match Alice at all.

Who would have thought there would be such a big drama?

She liked mature and steady types?

Is she talking about Samuel?

William's eyes narrowed slightly, and he unconsciously tightened his grip on Alice's hand.

"Ouch!" Alice exclaimed softly, complaining in pain, "William, you're hurting me."

William snapped back to reality and realized he almost hurt Alice. He immediately let go and apologized, "I'm sorry, Alice."

"It's okay, I don't blame you," Alice said sweetly.

Then, she discreetly looked at Victoria, who was standing in front of the roses, blushing from their fragrance.

Victoria was wearing a black cropped wool sweater with jeans, a brown coat over it, her long hair tied up in a high ponytail, revealing her slender neck, looking particularly bright and dazzling.

Seeing her like this, a dark shadow flashed in Alice's eyes.

Victoria.

Alton felt a bit disappointed hearing Victoria's response.

But he didn't give up; instead, he became more determined and expressed his thoughts, "Victoria, although I can't be the way you like right now, I will work hard. Just wait and see!"

With that, he turned and ran off.

Leaving Victoria speechless, staring at the enormous bouquet of roses.

Victoria was worrying about how to handle the flowers when Wendy whispered in her ear, "Victoria, look over there, who is that?"

Following Wendy's gaze, Victoria saw William in a dark casual suit, looking relaxed.

He was holding the hand of Alice, who looked like a fairy tale princess.

They were a perfect match.

In Victoria's memory, she had never seen William shopping.

It seemed he was accompanying Alice to pick out furniture today.

He was really thoughtful.

And now, Alice no longer looked as pale and haggard as when she first saw her in the hospital.

Her face had a healthy rosy glow, and she wore a sweet, shy smile.

It seemed William was taking good care of her.

Seeing her radiant appearance, Victoria couldn't help but think of Ella's weak and miserable state in the hospital.

She remembered the hideous and terrifying wounds on her body.

And now, her sister Alice was holding her ex-fiancé's hand, looking sweet and happy.

The stark contrast left Victoria in a daze.

When she came back to her senses, William had already walked past her with Alice, expressionless.

Victoria stood there in a daze for a long time.

Until Wendy nudged her, "Victoria, are you okay?"

Victoria snapped back to reality and shook her head, "I'm fine. I was just thinking about how to handle all these roses."

Wendy looked at the crowd gathering around and suggested, "How about we make a rose display? After all, it's bought by a client's son, so it's reasonable to use it."

Victoria nodded in agreement, she had the same idea.

So Victoria and Wendy started arranging the roses.

William took Alice around the building.

The furniture here was all from internationally renowned brands, expensive and exquisite.

Alice liked a sheepskin sofa, soft and comfortable to touch, with a thick handmade blanket on it, which should be quite warm to lie on.

But it was a bit pricey, with a three-seater sofa priced at over a million dollars.

Alice hesitated upon hearing the price.

"William, is this sofa really that expensive?" she was a bit reluctant.

William lovingly patted Alice's head and bought it for her with a swipe of his card, smiling at Alice, "Whatever you like, I'll get it for you."

Alice was moved and threw herself into his arms, complaining, "William, you're so good to me. When I was in Valados, I lived in shabby apartments."

Hearing this, William tightened his arm around her soft waist and said in a deep voice, "You're the daughter of the Garcia family, and they treated you like that?"

Alice nodded, biting her lip, her eyes slightly red, "I don't blame them. The tuition at Valados is so expensive. It's good enough that they paid for my tuition. As for living expenses, I could earn them by working."

"You had to work to earn money?" William frowned, "Why didn't you tell me?"

Alice looked up at him with her watery eyes, pitifully, "Ella sacrificed so much for me. How could I complain to you behind her back? Besides, I didn't want you to worry about me."

William looked at Alice, suddenly at a loss for words.

After a while, he slowly said, "If you have any difficulties in the future, you must tell me."

Alice's face lit up with a joyful smile, "Okay!"

After chatting for a while, William picked out a few more pieces of furniture she liked, then took her hand and walked towards the door.

Victoria and Wendy found an empty spot in the hall, laid down a thick carpet, and arranged the roses neatly.

Finally, they set up a beautiful crystal glass roof over it.

Bathed in warm yellow light, the rose carpet seemed as splendid and fantastical as a dreamland.

"So beautiful!" Wendy exclaimed.

Victoria liked it too.

Their hard work was worth it.

As they admired the rose display, someone suddenly shouted, "Are you Victoria?"

Victoria turned her head.

She saw a young girl in a pink and purple winter dress, carrying a sheepskin handbag, with light makeup, glaring at her with eyes full of anger.

"You know me?"

Victoria was puzzled.

Sofia snorted coldly, "Of course I know you, Victoria. You're the one who seduced my boyfriend!"

Victoria frowned, about to say something.

Wendy was furious, "Who are you, crazy girl? What nonsense are you talking about?"

"Who I am is none of your business, but I can guarantee that Victoria is a flirt who seduces men everywhere!"

"You!" Wendy was so angry she couldn't speak.

Victoria stopped the furious Wendy, calmly looking at Sofia, and asked, "Who are you? If you don't tell me, I'll call the police."

"You dare ask who I am?" Sofia pointed at her, "Because of you, my boyfriend broke up with me."

###chapter 67 I'm Not Familiar with Alton at All

"Who is your boyfriend? Please make it clear." Victoria raised an eyebrow and asked.

"My boyfriend is Alton. Stop playing dumb with me!" Sofia pointed at her angrily, as if she wanted to tear her apart.

Victoria was speechless, feeling a sense of helplessness.

"You misunderstood, I'm not familiar with Alton at all, and I don't like him." Victoria patiently explained, "Your breakup has nothing to do with me."

"Bullshit!"

"Stop making excuses here!" Sofia pointed at her and cursed, "You bitch, do you think I don't know who you are? Your dad designed a bridge that collapsed and killed dozens of people, and you're no better. You're just a slut who steals others' job opportunities by selling yourself, and you even seduce a rich guy who already has a fiancée. You're the worst of the worst, shameless!"

The onlookers were shocked and looked at Victoria in disbelief. They didn't expect such a seemingly innocent girl to have such a messy private life.

Some even took out their phones to secretly film the scene.

Upon hearing this, Victoria's deep eyes narrowed, and a cold light flashed.

She looked coldly at the aggressive Sofia and questioned in a cold voice, "Miss, do you have any evidence? If not, don't blame me for suing you for defamation!"

"You!"

"I advise you to leave quickly, or when the security comes, you won't be able to leave even if you want to."

"I'm not leaving. I must expose you! I want to see what qualifications you have to stay here!"

Victoria couldn't be bothered to deal with her.

"Wendy, let's go." Victoria pulled Wendy and walked around Sofia towards the exit.

Sofia panicked and rushed forward, blocking their way.

She pointed at Victoria and shouted, "Stop! Did I say you could leave?"

Victoria frowned and looked at her displeased, asking, "What do you want now?"

"You must promise me today to cut off all contact with Alton immediately! Otherwise..." she threatened viciously.

Victoria couldn't help but laugh bitterly, "Are you out of your mind? I already told you I'm not familiar with him. Do you not understand human language?"

"You!" Sofia was furious and raised her hand to slap Victoria.

But before she could touch Victoria, Wendy grabbed her wrist and looked at her disdainfully, "Do you have rabies? Barking and hitting people here! If you're sick, go get treated, don't go crazy outside."

With that, she pulled Victoria's hand and walked away.

Sofia was trembling with anger. Suddenly, she saw a tiger head ornament nearby, grabbed it without thinking, and threw it at Victoria while screaming, "You bitch! I'll kill you!"

Victoria was caught off guard and hit directly.

A sharp pain shot through her arm.

"Victoria! Are you okay?" Wendy was terrified.

Seeing this, Sofia laughed hysterically and even wanted to pick up another tiger head to throw at Victoria.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed her wrist and twisted it forcefully.

Sofia screamed in pain, feeling as if her entire arm was dislocated. She cried out in pain, tears almost streaming down her face.

"You bitch..."

Victoria endured the severe pain in her shoulder and looked up to see William with a grim face, throwing Sofia to the ground. 

A crisp sound echoed through the hall.

William slapped her so hard that half of her face swelled up.

Sofia was stunned.

Victoria was also stunned.

William's cold gaze swept over the disheveled Sofia on the ground, then he turned to Victoria and asked in a deep voice, "Are you okay?"

Victoria held her shoulder and shook her head blankly.

She couldn't believe William to slap Sofia to defend her, which was beyond her expectations.

Seeing this, William's expression softened slightly. He helped Victoria sit on the sofa and said gently, "Sit down and rest for a while."

Victoria was dazed for a moment before she responded softly.

At this time, Wendy snapped out of her shock. She quickly approached Victoria and asked concernedly, "Victoria, how's your injury?"

Victoria shook her head, "It's okay, I'm fine."

Sofia got up from the ground, covering her face, and looked hatefully at the cold William who had suddenly appeared and hit her. She cried, "Are you also this woman's lover? I'm telling you, she's a slut who sleeps around. Don't be fooled by her pitiful appearance!"

"Shut up!" William scolded, his icy voice filled with murderous intent.

Sofia shivered but still shouted fearlessly, "Why are you so fierce? Am I wrong? She's a slut, a bitch!"

William's eyes turned cold, and he didn't want to waste any more words with her. He directly called the police.

"I just hit her once, and you hit me back. It's just a small matter, and you're calling the police? Who are you trying to scare?" Sofia sneered and then turned to Victoria, "Alton's family will never accept you someone like you. I advise you to give up early!"

"Have you said enough?" Wendy couldn't stand it anymore. She grabbed Sofia's hair and shook it hard, "Do you believe I'll hit you?"

Soon, the police arrived.

After investigating the surveillance and testimonies of the people around, Sofia was taken away for causing trouble.

Everything would be decided after Victoria's injury report came out.

Victoria wanted to take a cab to the hospital, but William stopped her with a look.

"Come with me!" he ordered coldly.

Victoria pursed her lips and obediently followed him to the parking lot.

Alice was already waiting in the car.

She sat in the passenger seat and greeted her with a gentle smile, "Ms. Carter."

Victoria nodded politely, "Hello, Ms. Garcia."

William glanced at her and sat directly in the driver's seat.

Victoria hesitated for a moment but eventually sat in the back seat.

As soon as the car door closed, a faint fragrance wafted into her nose. Victoria instinctively frowned but didn't show it.

She had always been somewhat allergic to perfume. William's car never had a perfume smell before.

It must be coming from Alice.

Victoria lowered her eyes and leaned against the car window, holding her arm and resting.

The car drove steadily forward, and Alice and William discussed how to arrange the furniture they had just bought.

William listened patiently and occasionally offered suggestions.

So they were already living together?

Victoria had never seen him so gentle before, and she couldn't help but feel a bit dazed.

Even with Ella, William never seemed so gentle and careful.

It seemed more like he was performing for the fiancée's title, without much genuine affection.

But Victoria could easily see the genuine affection he held for Alice in his eyes-a palpable adoration that betrayed the depth of his feelings.

True love, perhaps, was meant to describe this situation.

It was undoubtedly true love.

Victoria felt a strange bitterness in her heart, but what followed was relief and release.

He already had true love, so he would let her go, right?

"Ms. Carter, the boy who sent you roses is quite nice. You might want to consider him," Alice suddenly joked lightly.

###chapter 68 Do You Like Victoria?

She had a serene and elegant demeanor, always wearing a faint smile when she spoke.

This was what a true lady of a noble family should be like;⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ she exuded grace and elegance in every gesture, and her words carried a sense of intimacy and ease that made people feel very comfortable.

Ella, who always spoke with hidden sarcasm, was completely unlike a young lady raised in a wealthy family.

It was said that Willow was a mistress who climbed her way up, so it's no wonder Ella behaved like that. 

Thinking of this, she looked up and gave Alice a friendly smile, "Thank you for Ms. Garcia's suggestion, but I don't have any plans to date anyone at the moment."

"That's really a pity," Alice sighed lightly, then added, "Ms. Carter is so beautiful, no wonder that girl is so jealous of you; she has lost all sense of reason."

"That girl looks like she's from a wealthy family, why would she be jealous of someone like me?" Victoria said with a bitter smile.

Although she knew Alice was complimenting her, such flattery felt somewhat ironic to a loser.

Hearing her words, William's grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly.

The hospital wasn't far, and they arrived quickly.

Victoria quickly got out of the car and immediately said to the two still in the car, "Thank you, Mr. Scott and Ms. Garcia, I'll just go get some medicine myself, you two take care on the way." With that, she didn't wait for their response and quickly ran into the hospital building.

William watched her back, his expression complex as he withdrew his gaze.

Then he turned the car around and headed home.

Alice looked at William, whose face didn't look too good, and tentatively asked, "William, do you like Victoria?"

As soon as she finished speaking, William suddenly slammed on the brakes.

The screeching sound of the tires against the ground startled Alice.

"Did I say something wrong?" she blinked timidly.

William frowned deeply and stared at her, "Don't let your imagination run wild!"

Alice chuckled lightly, "William, you know, when a man says a woman is imagining things, it usually means the woman guessed right, but because she has no evidence, the man thinks he can get away with it."

William's handsome face turned gloomy, "You know about her and me?"

The smile on Alice's face gradually faded, and after a moment of silence, she sighed softly, "William, I've been gone for so many years, it's natural that you couldn't stay faithful to me. But now that I'm back, I hope you won't get entangled with her anymore, okay?"

William's eyes were deep as the sea, and after a moment, he replied, "I've already made things clear with her, don't worry."

Hearing his words, Alice smiled again, reached out to tug at William's sleeve, and said sweetly, "I believe William won't lie to me."

William nodded and reached out to ruffle her hair.

Alice squinted her eyes in satisfaction, her smile sweet.

William drove her to the restaurant she had been looking forward to.

During the meal, he received a text from his lawyer, asking how he wanted to handle the situation.

William replied simply and decisively with just a few words: [Let her go to jail.]

Sofia, who hit Victoria, had a father, Lloyd Moore, who was a high-ranking executive at a bank. She had been pampered and spoiled since childhood, which made her arrogant and domineering.

Who knew she would find a boyfriend who dumped her for a small-time employee.

Sofia couldn't swallow her anger and immediately investigated Victoria's background.

She discovered that Victoria had a notorious reputation.

Her father Alvin was in prison, and she herself had been involved in scandals for allegedly using her body to climb the social ladder.

There were even rumors that she had an unclear relationship with a big shot who had a fiancée.

Being dumped for someone like that, of course, Sofia was unhappy.

She went directly to cause trouble, which led to the current situation.

It wasn't until she was locked up in the police station's detention center that she started to get scared.

She kept begging the police to let her out.

Her parents had always doted on Sofia and couldn't bear to see her suffer.

So they asked a familiar lawyer to smooth things over at the police station.

Initially, Sofia's parents thought it was just a petty rivalry between girls, and since Sofia had also been hit, it shouldn't be a big deal. At worst, they would just pay some money.

But the lawyer told them that the matter was far-reaching, and there was a big shot involved, making it impossible to bail her out.

They panicked and sought help from many people, but to no avail.

After three days of Sofia's detention, they finally found out that the person Sofia had hit was William's woman.

What kind of existence is the Scott family?

The top conglomerate in Crystalia, capable of shaking the entire city with a single move.

Lloyd was just an ordinary bank executive and couldn't afford to provoke them.

Sofia's mother, Thalia Moore, cried her eyes out, while Lloyd was worried sick.

Lloyd, who usually looked shrewd, now had gray hair and a troubled expression.

Finally, their lawyer suggested they seek help from Alton to plead with the victim.

As long as the victim agreed, everything would be resolved.

Since the matter started because of him, and seeing Lloyd and Thalia's sincere pleas, Alton hesitated for a moment and agreed to help, despite his embarrassment at facing Victoria again.

Victoria then learned that Sofia had been detained for three days.

And no one knew how much longer she would be held.

It seemed William wanted her to go to jail.

She didn't expect William to care so much about her being hit.

Although the tiger head had indeed swollen her arm, it wasn't serious enough to warrant jail time.

After thinking it over, she decided to call William.

William was about to drive home when he received her call.

"Mr. Scott," Victoria's tone was calm.

"What is it?" William asked.

Victoria hesitated for a moment before saying, "Sofia has been detained for three days."

There was silence on the other end of the line for a few seconds.

William's deep, magnetic voice slowly sounded, "So?"

Victoria bit her lip and hesitated for a moment before saying, "Mr. Scott, I think it would be better to settle this privately. She's only 19, still a young girl. If she's sentenced, her life could be ruined."

William raised an eyebrow, his tone mocking, "Are you saying I'm being too harsh?"

Victoria was stunned for a moment and quickly denied, "Of course not, you're standing up for me. I'm not ungrateful. I just think that making a big deal out of this isn't good for either of us, especially since my reputation isn't great to begin with."

After listening, William's lips curled into a cold smile, and he scoffed, "Victoria, you're still so hypocritical."

With that, he hung up the phone.

###chapter 69 She Just Wants to Extort More Money

Victoria heard the phone click, paused for a moment, and then suddenly gave a helpless smile.

Of course, she didn't want to let it go just like that.

Sofia insulted her in front of so many people and even injured her, just because her family background was better than hers, right?

If she just let it go, wouldn't that mean she was easy to bully and let others trample on her?

But what could she do?

Ever since Alvin had his accident, there was no one to protect her anymore.

And she didn't know if William helped her this time because he truly felt sorry for her injury or just because he was provoked.

Moreover, he already had Alice by his side now.

If she didn't let it go now, what would happen when William decided to leave her alone in the future? Who would stand up for her then?

The more Victoria thought about it, the more humiliated she felt. She buried her head in the pillow, her eyes slightly red.

After a while, she got up from the bed and called Samuel.

Because her arm was injured, she couldn't go to the studio to paint with Samuel on Saturday.

When Samuel received her call, he was a bit worried. "Victoria, are you sick?"

Victoria didn't want him to worry, so she chose to hide the truth. "No, I've just been really busy lately."

Samuel was stunned for a moment, then smiled bitterly. "Victoria, even after all this time, you still keep your distance from me."

Hearing this, Victoria felt a pang in her heart, and her eyes couldn't help but moisten.

She sniffed, trying hard to control her emotions. "I'm fine, just a bit tired lately. I'll be okay after some rest."

Samuel pondered for a moment and then gently advised. "If you need anything, remember to tell me. There's no need for formalities between us."

Victoria bit her lip and nodded. "Okay, thank you, Samuel."

At William's command, Sofia was released.

That night, the Moore family called, wanting to bring Sofia to apologize to Victoria in person, and of course, they also invited William to attend.

Lloyd and Thalia were humble and extremely polite.

Victoria initially refused, but couldn't resist Thalia's persistent persuasion, moved by her motherly love, and finally agreed to attend the dinner.

At 7:30 PM, Victoria arrived on time.

As she reached the hotel entrance, a black Maybach stopped in front of her.

The driver got out and opened the rear door.

A man in a suit and tie, exuding an air of nobility, stepped out of the car.

He looked at Victoria with deep eyes, as if they contained a thousand mountains covered in snow.

William walked towards her, and their eyes met, both showing complex emotions.

After a long while, William hoarsely called out, "Victoria."

Victoria sighed lightly and looked away first. "Mr. Scott."

William glanced at her arm, his eyes darkening. "How's your arm?"

Victoria nodded, lowering her eyes slightly, and said self-deprecatingly. "I've become a regular at the hospital. This little injury is no big deal."

Hearing her say that, William felt a surge of inexplicable anger. "No big deal? Then what do you consider a big deal?"

Victoria was stunned, not understanding why he suddenly got angry, and remained silent.

William stared at her for a moment, then suddenly sneered. "I forgot how tough you are, just like how shameless you can be!"

After saying that, he walked past her and headed into the hotel.

Victoria stood there for a long time before slowly reacting.

He actually called her shameless!

How dare he insult her? How dare he?

Victoria felt a tightness in her chest, a breath of anger stuck in her throat.

She clenched her fists, holding back her anger, and caught up with William.

When they opened the door to the private room, the Moore family and Alton all stood up.

Sofia, having been detained for a few days, was much more subdued, but Victoria could tell she was still full of resentment.

Alton glanced at Victoria with some embarrassment, then lowered his head in fear of William beside her.

If he had known she was William's woman, he wouldn't have dared to provoke her.

Lloyd awkwardly smiled. "Mr. Scott, you're here, please have a seat."

William, with a cold expression, sat down in the center, while Victoria sat to his left.

Once everyone was seated, Lloyd eagerly raised his glass to Victoria. "Ms. Carter, this incident was all because Sofia was young and ignorant..."

Before Victoria could speak, William interrupted Lloyd. "Young? Victoria is less than a year older than your daughter. Is she not young?"

Lloyd awkwardly closed his mouth.

If he hadn't mentioned it, no one would have thought Victoria was so young.

Because she no longer had that youthful naivety, but rather a mature and composed demeanor.

Lloyd carefully continued. "Sofia has realized her mistake. Ms. Carter, I brought her here today to apologize to you, hoping you can forgive her."

Victoria looked at Sofia, who seemed composed and not at all remorseful.

She glanced at her briefly, then turned to Lloyd and calmly replied, "Mr. Moore, it wasn't you who did it. There's no need for you to apologize to me."

William, amused by her assertiveness, chimed in. "Exactly, if the person who made the mistake doesn't apologize, then let's just forget it."

Sofia slammed the table, her eyes wide with anger, and accused. "I just hit you once, and you had me detained for so many days. Now you're turning the tables on me. Do you have any sense of reason?"

"What did you say?" William narrowed his eyes dangerously.

Victoria placed a hand on his arm, signaling him to stay calm.

Victoria looked up at Sofia, her clear eyes flashing with cold light. "It seems Ms. Moore doesn't think she did anything wrong. In that case, there's no need to continue this dinner."

"You!" Sofia's face changed, clenching her fists in anger.

Lloyd frowned and quickly tried to smooth things over. "Ms. Carter, it's a misunderstanding. Sofia didn't mean it that way."

He sincerely said. "Ms. Carter, this is all my fault for not educating her properly. Please be magnanimous and let's just forget this ever happened."

"Dad, why are you begging her? She just wants to extort more money." Sofia said indignantly, full of sarcasm, then turned to Victoria, "Tell me, how much do you want? The Moore family can afford it. Name your price!"

Victoria was shocked by Sofia's shamelessness.

She had come to this dinner just to get an apology, but Sofia insulted her like this.

And judging by Lloyd and Thalia's expressions, they didn't seem to oppose her actions.

To them, she was just here to get compensation.

Victoria smirked, looking at Sofia with a half-smile. "Sofia, I'm afraid you can't afford the compensation I want."

"How much do you want?" Sofia looked at her disdainfully.

Victoria curled her lips and slowly said. "One billion dollars."

Sofia burst into laughter, pointing at Victoria with an exaggerated expression. "Are you crazy? Do you know how much a billion dollars is?"

###chapter 70 Feeling Soft-hearted?

Victoria calmly sipped her tea, "Didn't you say I could name my price? What? Backing out already? If that's the case, then I guess I came here for nothing."

Lloyd quickly interjected, "Ms. Carter, Sofia is still a child and doesn't know any better. Please don't hold it against her."

He kept signaling Sofia to apologize.

Unfortunately, Sofia didn't appreciate it and instead directed all her anger at Victoria.

"Who 's backing out? You're the one making outrageous demands!"

Victoria raised an eyebrow, "If you can't afford it, that's fine. You don't need to apologize. You injured my arm, so let me hit you until I'm satisfied, and I'll let Mr. Scott drop the matter. How about that?"

"You! You're too much!" Sofia's eyes turned red, and she started to cry, "You're bullying me!"

Victoria's face remained indifferent, "My terms are fair."

Thalia, seeing Sofia crying in anger, quickly tried to comfort her, "Sofia, don't cry."

She turned her head and glared at Victoria, "Ms. Carter, asking for a hundred million dollars is unreasonable. We're sincerely trying to resolve this matter with you, so there's no need to be so aggressive."

Lloyd, despite his fear of William, couldn't help but get a little angry, "Ms. Carter, as far as I know, you're just a small employee at a gallery, living off your salary, with a sick mother and a brother still in school to support. Name a realistic number, and don't make things difficult."

Alton, seeing the tense atmosphere, wanted to say something in Victoria's defense but chose to remain silent because William was present.

Victoria chuckled softly, a hint of self-mockery in her eyes.

It seemed that, in the eyes of the Moore family, everything she did was just to get more money.

To these wealthy people, anything that could be solved with money was not a big issue.

But if you wanted to harm their noble bodies, that was a great insult.

They never considered that while their bodies could feel pain, so could others'.

Rich people had dignity, and so did poor people.

Victoria's hand on her knee clenched slightly. She took a deep breath, trying to suppress the anger about to erupt, and said calmly, "You can't come up with the money, and you don't want me to hurt your precious body, so there's nothing more to say."

With that, she stood up to leave.

William grabbed her hand, pressing her back into the chair, and extinguished his cigarette in the ashtray.

His eyes were dark, and his voice was cold, "Do as she says. Let her hit your daughter until she's satisfied."

William's tone was calm, but the underlying menace and ruthlessness were terrifying.

As soon as he spoke, the temperature in the restaurant seemed to drop several degrees.

Sofia trembled in fear, almost collapsing to the floor.

She stammered, "No... no way!"

Thalia panicked, "Mr. Scott!"

William glanced at them mockingly, "I understand you want to protect your daughter, but I also have to protect my woman. It's either a beating or jail. You choose. I'll give you a day to think about it."

With that, he took Victoria's hand and walked out of the private room.

Sofia stood there in shock for a moment before rushing to the door, only to be stopped by the bodyguards waiting outside.

"Mr. Scott, please listen to me. Give me another chance. I was wrong. I really know I was wrong."

But William didn't stop, walking straight out.

Victoria followed beside him, her head down, feeling conflicted.

Lloyd's words echoed in her mind, reminding her of the times Alvin had defended her.

She kept her head down, ignoring William's increasingly tight grip on her hand.

In the car, the warm air from the air conditioner blew gently. William looked out the window at the passing neon lights, his expression unreadable.

Victoria pressed her lips together, saying nothing.

Suddenly, William turned his head, staring at her profile, and asked softly, "What's wrong?"

Victoria's eyelashes fluttered slightly, and she slowly shook her head.

"Don't let their crazy talk get to you." William's voice was magnetic and low.

Victoria pressed her lips together, "Thank you for helping me."

If it weren't for him, she would have had to swallow the insults and injuries in silence.

It seemed he wasn't as bad as she thought.

"To hear a 'thank you' from you is quite rare," William scoffed.

Victoria ignored his mockery and continued, "That Sofia is still young. Just give her a little lesson. Even if she let me hit her, I couldn't do it."

William narrowed his eyes, "What? Feeling soft-hearted?"

Victoria paused, raising her clear, bright eyes to look at him seriously, "It's not soft-hearted. I just think her parents have it tough."

"you're kind-hearted but foolish, always letting useless people bully you," William said nonchalantly.

Victoria pressed her lips together and said nothing more.

William smirked, then leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes to rest.

After a while, Victoria's phone rang.

She glanced at the number; it was Samuel calling.

Victoria looked at William, hesitated for two seconds, and answered the call.

"Victoria, my parents are here. They want to invite you to dinner the day after tomorrow. Can you come?" Samuel warmly invited over the phone.

Victoria glanced at William, who was resting with his eyes closed, turned her head, and lowered her voice, "Okay."

After hanging up, she looked at William. He still had his eyes closed, showing no reaction. She let out a long breath.

It seemed that once Alice returned, he really wouldn't bother her anymore.

Thinking this, she felt much more at ease. A faint smile appeared on her lips as she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, looking even more gentle and pure.

William opened his eyes just in time to catch this moment.

His heart sank, and even his breathing became difficult.

Was she that happy to meet Samuel's parents?

What was so good about that old man?

What was she so happy about?

He narrowed his eyes, a strange feeling spreading in his heart, tinged with a bit of sourness and helplessness.

Victoria sensed William's gaze and immediately returned to her usual self.

William suppressed his emotions, placed his hand on the armrest, and said lightly, "I just remembered I have something to do at the office. You'll have to take a cab home."

###chapter 71 Learn to Rely on Me

Victoria was taken aback and nodded in agreement.

William asked Harry to pull the car over to the side of the road. After Victoria got out, the car immediately drove away.

Victoria stood still, looked up at the pitch-black night sky, sighed deeply, and walked towards the bus stop.

On the day she had arranged to meet Samuel, Victoria worked all day despite the pain in her arm.

Samuel was already waiting for her outside the Starry Studio Gallery in his car.

She tidied up her clothes and makeup, then hurried over with her bag.

Today, Samuel was wearing an off-white suit, his hair neatly combed, making him look both refined and elegant.

He opened the car door and got out, walking towards Victoria.

Victoria was about to greet him when suddenly someone jumped out from the side and grabbed her hand.

She was startled and instinctively shook off the person.

Upon closer inspection, she realized it was Sofia.

"Ms. Moore, what do you want now?" she frowned.

Samuel frowned slightly and stepped forward, standing protectively beside Victoria.

Sofia's cheeks were red, as if she had been crying, looking pitiful and tearful.

"Ms. Carter, I'm here to apologize to you. I'm sorry, I was too impulsive before. I hope you can be forgiving and not hold a grudge against my previous offense."

She spoke humbly, without a trace of arrogance.

Victoria frowned, "What do you mean by this?"

Such a drastic change in attitude in just one day made Victoria worry that Sofia might have some ulterior motive.

Samuel, standing beside her, remained silent, his usually gentle face now somewhat gloomy, revealing nothing of his thoughts.

Sofia wiped her tears and pulled at her clothes, revealing a bruised shoulder.

"Ms. Carter, this was done by Mr. Scott's men."

"Are you here to settle scores with me?" Victoria raised an eyebrow.

"No, I'm here to apologize." She bit her lip, forcing a smile, "I was blinded by jealousy before and did something foolish. Now I've come to my senses and want to apologize to you in person."

As she spoke, she bowed deeply.

Victoria was slightly stunned by her actions.

Such behavior didn't seem like an act of revenge.

But she didn't believe Sofia's words and remained cautious, "Ms. Moore, I don't care what your intentions are today, but I advise you not to have any bad ideas!"

"I really know I was wrong!" Sofia said urgently.

Her attitude was sincere, her eyes red, looking extremely aggrieved. "I heard from my father that Mr. Scott originally intended to have me imprisoned for a year and a half. Fortunately, Ms. Carter, you didn't hold a grudge, and Mr. Scott showed mercy and released me early!"

After speaking, she bowed again, this time genuinely.

Victoria was very surprised.

She didn't expect William to reveal her plea to the Moore family.

This not only vented her anger but also made the Moore family owe her a favor.

"Ms. Carter, you saved my life. Without you, I would have been ruined forever."

She choked and sobbed.

Victoria pursed her lips, glanced at Sofia, and then looked away, "I've received your apology. Let's leave it at that."

With that, she signaled to Samuel, who was waiting nearby, and prepared to get in the car and leave.

Sofia grabbed her again and handed her a card, "Ms. Carter, there's $200,000 in here. It's not much, but it's a token of my appreciation."

Victoria glanced at the bank card but didn't take it, "You've been hurt and apologized to me. We're even. Keep the money."

"No, no, this is my token of appreciation! Please, you must accept it!" Sofia held her hand tightly, her eyes red.

Victoria was about to refuse when Samuel suddenly spoke up, "Victoria, accept it. If you don't, she probably won't be at ease."

Samuel emphasized "at ease," and Sofia immediately echoed, "Ms. Carter, please accept it!"

Victoria hesitated for a few seconds before finally agreeing, "Alright, I'll accept it."

Sofia was overjoyed, "Thank you, Ms. Carter!"

After sending Sofia away, Victoria got into the car.

Samuel hadn't spoken since getting in.

Victoria had never seen him so serious before. She pursed her lips and tentatively called out, "Samuel?"

Samuel turned his head, his gaze falling on her slightly pale face.

After a moment, he spoke slowly, "Victoria, you told me before that you couldn't come to paint because your arm was injured by that girl, right?"

Victoria was stunned for a few seconds before quickly coming to her senses.

She nodded, "Yes."

"I should have guessed." He murmured, a hint of helplessness in his eyes.

Even after all this time, Victoria still hadn't thought of relying on him.

She could accept William's money and help, but she wouldn't owe him anything.

She said she didn't want to trouble him, but in reality, she was just keeping her distance.

Even someone as confident as Samuel felt a sense of defeat at this moment.

"Victoria, I actually mind a little." He looked out the window, his tone serious, "In the future, learn to rely on me, okay?"

Victoria's body trembled, and she turned to look at him.

His handsome and refined face was full of gentleness and care.

He asked her to learn to rely on me in the future.

A faint smile appeared on her lips, but her eyes glistened with tears, "Okay."

Samuel smiled, "Good girl."

As he spoke, he patted her head, "I know what you're worried about. Don't be afraid. With me here, no one can bully you."

Victoria's nose tingled, and she softly called out, "Samuel."

Her voice was hoarse and indistinct, as if filled with a thick nasal tone.

Samuel just patted her back and didn't say anything more.

The car fell silent, with only the sound of the engine running.

The car stopped at an estate.

This was the largest garden-themed restaurant in Silvermist City, called 'Aroma Garden Eatery.'

Victoria sat nervously across from Samuel's parents, feeling anxious.

She couldn't help but wonder what they would think of her.

"Dad, Mom, this is Victoria," Samuel introduced.

Victoria quickly stood up and respectfully said, "Mr. Brown, Mrs. Brown, nice to meet you."

Samuel's mother, Primrose Brown, looked Victoria up and down, nodding in satisfaction.

Other families already had grandchildren, but Samuel, almost thirty, showed no signs of getting married or even having a girlfriend.

Talking to him was useless; he had been independent since childhood and wouldn't let anyone interfere. 

Although Victoria's family background and education weren't impressive, she was beautiful and young. They could teach and nurture her slowly.

If they missed this opportunity, they might never find someone Samuel liked, and he would end up alone.

Thinking this, Primrose's face was full of smiles, "Sit here, let's not be formal."

Primrose warmly invited Victoria to sit and asked the waiter to bring the menu.

"Victoria, order whatever you like. Don't be shy."

Victoria felt a bit uneasy and quickly declined, "Mrs. Brown, you're too kind."

Seeing Victoria's discomfort, Samuel took the menu and ordered some of their favorite dishes.

The atmosphere at the table became lively.

Victoria was a bit overwhelmed. She hadn't expected Primrose to be so easygoing and to like her so much.

During the meal, Primrose kept serving her food, and Samuel's father, Elmer Brown, though not very talkative, was also very kind.

They treated her as if she were already their daughter-in-law.

They even discussed whether to live in Prosperity City or Silvermist City in the future.

This made Victoria very uncomfortable.

She explained that she and Samuel were not yet in a relationship, "Mr. Brown, Mrs. Brown, actually, Samuel and I..."

###chapter 72 We Won't Disturb Your 'Family' Meal!

She didn't finish her sentence before Samuel stuffed a shrimp into her mouth. "Victoria, you like this, eat more."

Victoria looked at him and swallowed the words that were on the tip of her tongue.

Better to talk about it later.

At that moment, a couple walked past them.

Elmer immediately recognized that it was William from the Scott family.

The Scott Group was currently the Brown family's top partner, so Elmer quickly stood up to greet him. "William!"

Victoria followed his gaze and saw that it was indeed William and Alice.

The two stopped and looked over at them.

Seeing Victoria with her head down, a cold smile appeared on William's lips.

William squinted his eyes and turned to Elmer, nodding politely. "Mr. Brown, you're here too."

Elmer chuckled. "We're having a family meal here."

"A family meal?" William glanced at the uneasy Victoria and the man next to her, Samuel, raising his eyebrows. "How lovely!"

Victoria's hands clenched under the table. She didn't know why William was here today.

Could it be that he heard her phone call with Samuel that day and came here specifically to confront her?

Her body trembled slightly, and just as she was about to say something, Samuel's hand suddenly held hers.

Victoria didn't want to overthink it, but the facts were right in front of her, and she couldn't help but think that way.

Victoria was startled and looked up, meeting Samuel's clear eyes.

He smiled at her, as if to reassure her, and then turned to William. "Thank you, Mr. Scott. Is this your girlfriend? She's very beautiful!"

Alice, who was holding William's arm, glanced at Victoria and tightened her grip a bit, seemingly shy as she replied softly, "Thank you for the compliment!"

"So you know each other!" Elmer was surprised.

Samuel nodded calmly. "We've met a few times."

William's deep eyes darkened slightly at his words.

"Since you know each other, why not join us for a meal?" Elmer invited warmly.

William smiled. "Thank you, Mr. Brown, but I'm afraid someone might feel uncomfortable. We won't disturb your 'family meal'!"

With that, he took Alice's hand and left the private room.

Elmer looked at the door, frowning. "Why do I feel like he's a bit unhappy?"

Samuel pondered for a moment and then said, "Maybe it's because his girlfriend is here."

Primrose nodded. "Indeed."

Victoria breathed a sigh of relief.

But she couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't over.

After William left, the atmosphere gradually returned to its previous liveliness. Primrose chatted with Victoria, asking about many interesting things in her daily life.

Victoria answered each question humbly, and the more Primrose looked at her, the more she liked her, becoming increasingly enthusiastic.

Victoria felt a bit overwhelmed and stood up, wanting to go to the restroom to take a break.

Samuel noticed her discomfort and smiled at her, not insisting on following her, giving her some time to relax.

Aroma Garden Eatery was quite large, and Victoria couldn't find the restroom after looking around.

Instead, she ended up in the flower room where the restaurant kept fresh flowers.

The decor inside was elegant, with walls covered in various flowers, emitting a faint fragrance.

Victoria was allergic to perfume but had no resistance to natural flowers.

The roses Alton sent last time probably had perfume sprayed on them, which made her sneeze.

She couldn't help but walk closer to the flowers, reaching out to pick a pink rose and bringing it to her nose to sniff. The sweet fragrance lingered, making her feel inexplicably relaxed.

She put the rose back and was about to leave.

But then she saw William standing by the flower room, smoking. His handsome profile was shrouded in a hazy light, mysterious and sexy.

He looked up inadvertently, and their eyes met. Victoria quickly looked away, feeling guilty.

Victoria didn't dare to stay any longer and hurriedly tried to leave.

William extinguished his cigarette and strode over, blocking her path.

Victoria took two steps back in fright, staring at him warily. "What are you doing?"

"Are you avoiding me?" William raised an eyebrow.

Victoria pressed her lips together, ignoring him and continuing to walk forward.

William grabbed her wrist and pulled her into the flower room, locking the door behind them.

"Let go!" Victoria struggled.

William pinned her against the wall, looking down at her with dangerous eyes. "Are you avoiding me?"

Victoria gritted her teeth and stubbornly raised her head. "No."

"No?" William sneered, pressing her. "Then why are you so flustered?"

Victoria was speechless.

Yes, why was she flustered? He already had Alice, so she had no reason to worry about him entangling with her.

Seeing her silence, William's tone became severe. "Tell me!"

Victoria bit her lip, refusing to speak.

William's eyes darkened. "Victoria, don't tell me you're avoiding me because you're afraid Samuel will misunderstand?"

Victoria was stunned. She did want to avoid him, but not because of Samuel.

"Think whatever you want!" Victoria said, turning to leave.

William grabbed her waist and pulled her into his arms, his lips landing on her neck, biting hard.

Victoria groaned.

She could clearly smell the strong scent of alcohol on William.

"Let go!" Victoria elbowed his abdomen, trying to break free, but it was futile.

She had to resort to using her legs to attack him.

But before her leg could touch him, William pinned her down. His other hand covered her breast, kneading through the soft sweater.

Victoria trembled all over.

She was both anxious and angry. "Bastard, let go of me!"

"You better pray I don't find out you have any intimate relationship with Samuel," William's hoarse voice sounded.

His fingers lingered on her chest, seemingly wanting to go further.

Victoria's eyes widened in horror, and she shook her head desperately. "No!"

William put a finger to his lips, whispering, "Shut up, and don't move, or else..."

Before he finished speaking, he kissed her lips.

His warm tongue invaded her mouth, taking in her scent, dominating her territory, and savoring her sweetness.

Victoria felt like she was floating, her thoughts lost in William's fiery breath.

His lips were cool and moist, like poppies blooming on a rainy night.

He kissed her, his hand wandering over her body, teasing her.

After what felt like an eternity, William finally reluctantly left her lips, resting his forehead against hers, whispering, "Good girl."

His warm breath tickled her ear, making her body tingle and a strange sense of unfamiliarity rise within her.

Victoria could clearly feel his swollen erection pressing against her, the scorching heat transmitting through their clothes to her skin, making her whole body stiffen.

"Alice is still waiting for you," Victoria reminded him softly.

###chapter 73 Do You Hate Me?

Hearing this name, William's eyes instantly regained clarity.

He furrowed his brows, withdrew from her, and gave her a deep look.

Then he straightened his clothes, pushed open the greenhouse door, and walked out.

Victoria panted slightly, a trace of sadness flashing in her eyes as she watched William's back.

She had almost lost control and entangled with him just now.

As William's figure disappeared from sight, Victoria composed herself and turned to leave.

Victoria walked towards the dining table and unexpectedly ran into Alice.

Alice looked at the flushed Victoria, and a trace of resentment flashed in her eyes.

She had come out looking for William.

He had said he was going out for a smoke but had been gone for a long time and hadn't returned.

Alice was worried that William might have encountered some accident while drunk, so she came out to find him.

Unexpectedly, she saw William kissing Victoria in the greenhouse, a passionate William she had never seen before.

The intimate scene almost drove her to collapse.

She had been living with him for so long, yet he had never touched her.

She always thought he respected her and cared for her body, so he was reluctant to touch her.

Now it seemed she was too naive.

Alice tightly gripped her phone, her nails digging into her flesh, seething with anger and wanting to kill.

But she held back; she wasn't a fool like Ella, who would get emotional and resort to violence at the slightest provocation.

Making a scene now would not benefit her at all.

She had long known about the relationship between Victoria and William.

But so what?

All men are dogs!

Just like Zachary, who used to dote on her mother but still cheated and had Ella, who was just a year younger than her.

After Alice's mother died, Zachary married Willow within three months.

But she could clearly feel that William had a special place for Victoria.

If she drove Victoria away tonight or quarreled with William because of her, she would be the one to suffer.

She would not allow this matter to escalate to an unbearable level.

Thinking of this, Alice put on a gentle smile and waved at Victoria, "Ms. Carter."

Victoria stopped and looked at Alice, feeling inexplicably guilty.

"Ms. Carter, have you seen William? I've been looking for him for a while," Alice asked, pretending to be calm.

Victoria cleared her throat and said softly, "I don't know. I just came out of the restroom and didn't see him."

Alice's eyes flickered, and she smiled, "If you didn't see him, then we must have missed each other."

Victoria nodded, said nothing more, and prepared to leave.

Alice called out to her, "By the way, my friend's bar is opening in a few days, and she wants me to bring some people to support her. I'm having trouble finding someone suitable. Why don't you come along? I promise to get you home safely after that, okay?"

Alice's words were accompanied by a gentle smile and a polite tone, making it hard to refuse.

Victoria hesitated for a moment but decided to decline.

She really didn't want to get involved with them any further.

"Sorry, I don't like lively places," Victoria replied tactfully.

"But I've already told Daisy you would come, and she was very happy. Are you sure you won't go? She would be very disappointed," Alice feigned disappointment.

Hearing this, Victoria hesitated.

Daisy had taken her to the hospital last time, and she hadn't thanked her yet.

"Since that's the case, I'll go," Victoria said.

Alice breathed a sigh of relief and smiled brightly, "Then it's settled. I'll send the address to your phone later, and I'll have a driver pick you up."

After saying this, Alice walked towards her seat.

Elmer and Primrose were very pleased with Victoria and even gave her a delicate jewelry box containing a beautiful diamond necklace when they left.

The necklace was a limited edition and very expensive.

"Ms. Carter, I had this specially designed for you. It will look beautiful on you."

"Thank you so much, but it's too valuable. I can't accept it," Victoria declined.

Primrose took her hand and said, "We are elders, and you can't refuse a gift from us. Take it!"

Victoria couldn't refuse Elmer and Primrose, so she looked at Samuel for help, hoping he would persuade them.

Samuel smiled and said, "Take it. If you don't accept my mom's choice, she will be unhappy."

Victoria had no choice but to accept the jewelry box.

At this moment, William also came out with Alice, seemingly not seeing them, and left through another exit.

But Victoria felt that his parting glance carried a chill, making her shiver.

Alice, holding William's arm, asked softly, "William, are we going home now?"

William saw Samuel's car leave through the window and said in a hoarse voice, "I'll take you home first. I have something to do."

Alice's heart sank, and she quickly asked, "What is it?"

"Just some work matters to handle. Don't worry, it's nothing major," William said perfunctorily.

Although Alice was unwilling, she agreed, "Alright then."

On the way home, Samuel noticed Victoria's low spirits and asked, "Victoria, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"

Victoria tightly held the expensive box in her hand and sighed, "Samuel, I can't accept this necklace."

"Don't you like it?" Samuel was a bit surprised.

Victoria shook her head and said bitterly, "Actually, I shouldn't have come to dinner with your parents today."

Samuel's grip on the steering wheel tightened, and he forced a smile, "Why do you say that?"

Victoria lowered her eyes, hiding the sadness and disappointment in them, and said softly, "Samuel, you're too good. We're not suitable."

Samuel's face changed suddenly after hearing Victoria's words, "Victoria, is it that we're not suitable, or you don't have feelings for me?"

Victoria paused and said slowly, "It's that I'm not worthy."

Samuel was the only person in this world, besides Alvin, who had given her warmth and care.

She had thought that with Alice back, William wouldn't bother her anymore.

She genuinely wanted to develop a relationship with Samuel and have a good outcome.

That's why she agreed to meet Elmer and Primrose with Samuel.

But today's kiss with William in the greenhouse made her realize that William wouldn't let her go easily.

She couldn't be entangled with William while openly enjoying Samuel's kindness.

Such behavior was too greedy and dirty.

Samuel suddenly braked sharply, the tires screeching against the ground, startling Victoria.

"Victoria, I just want to ask you, do you hate me?" Samuel turned to look into Victoria's eyes and asked seriously.

Victoria looked at Samuel's handsome and gentle face, her eyes slightly red, and said softly, "Samuel, how could I hate you?"

Samuel smiled, "If you don't hate me, it means you still have feelings for me, right?"

###chapter 74 Jealousy

Victoria was stunned.

"You're still young, let's take it slow, okay?" Samuel asked gently.

Samuel's words, "You're still young," completely shattered her last line of defense.

Victoria bit her lip, tears streaming down her cheeks. She blinked hard, trying to suppress the pain surging inside her, and nodded with difficulty, "I understand."

Samuel handed her a few tissues, "Why are you crying? I don't mind, so why should you? When you've made up your mind, give me an answer, okay?"

Victoria nodded, looked at the box in her hand, thought for a moment, and handed it back to Samuel, "Samuel, I can't accept this right now. I hope you understand."

Samuel reached out and took it, "Okay, I understand."

Samuel drove Victoria back to her apartment.

He helped her carry her bag out of the car.

Before handing the bag to Victoria, he pulled her into his arms and gently kissed her forehead, saying, "Good night, Victoria."

Victoria stood there in a daze, watching him smile and say goodbye before driving away.

Watching the black luxury car disappear into the distance, her eyes were filled with complexity and confusion.

The night breeze blew away the smog in the air, and the stars shone brightly.

Victoria opened the door to her apartment, and the room was pitch black. She was about to turn on the light.

But she saw a red ember on the sofa, flickering on and off.

Someone was in her home!

Victoria gasped and was about to run to the door when a familiar voice sounded in the room.

"Come here!" William's voice carried a hint of coldness.

Victoria stopped in her tracks, standing at the entrance, hesitating and not daring to take a step forward.

William's voice came again, "I'll say it one more time, come in! Otherwise, I don't know what I might do!"

The threat in his words was even stronger than before, making her shiver uncontrollably.

With a soft click, she turned on the room's light.

Taking a deep breath, she walked heavily towards the living room.

William sat on the sofa, legs crossed, lazily leaning back, a cigarette between his long fingers, the red ember flickering.

He looked up at Victoria, his deep pupils narrowing, his thin lips pressed into a straight line.

Victoria felt a chill run down her spine under William's gaze. She swallowed and tentatively asked, "Mr. Scott, what do you want from me?"

William flicked the ash from his cigarette, squinting his eyes and looking at her with a half-smile, "What, did I interrupt your intimate moment with Professor Brown?"

Hearing "intimate," Victoria's face changed instantly, "You saw it."

Her trembling voice betrayed her inner fear.

William blew out a smoke ring, casually saying, "Are you referring to the hug or the kiss on the forehead?"

Victoria didn't answer; she didn't know what to say at this moment.

She only knew that William's calm tone contained a lot of anger.

William sneered, stood up, and walked over to Victoria, looking down at her.

Victoria looked up at William in panic.

William reached out and pinched her sharp chin, shaking it slightly.

"I never expected that you, with this pretty and innocent face, is so good at seducing men in private!"

Victoria's chin hurt from his grip, and she frowned, "Let go of me."

William's eyes grew sharper, staring at Victoria without saying a word, but the atmosphere around them grew colder.

Victoria felt like she was being stared at by a venomous snake, her whole body covered in goosebumps.

"William, please let go, my chin hurts," Victoria's voice was soft and weak.

William looked at her pale face and suddenly laughed, "Victoria, you're always so good at looking pitiful, but..."

He suddenly picked Victoria up, sneering, "But I just fall for it."

Victoria struggled, pushing against William, but she was no match for the 6'1" William and was eventually carried into the bedroom.

Victoria was thrown onto the bed, her body hitting the mattress, making her groan in pain.

William took off his suit jacket and threw it on the carpet. He pulled at his tie, walking towards Victoria on the bed.

He leaned over, trapping her in his arms, "You know, I wanted to do this in the greenhouse!"

Victoria watched as William tied her hands with his tie, panicking, "William, what are you doing!"

William lifted Victoria's chin, whispering in her ear, "Making love to you!"

"No!" Victoria struggled desperately, "William, you can't do this to me, let me go!"

William's lips curled into a wicked smile, pulling her up from the bed, "Victoria, I've spoiled you too much lately. You forgot I warned you before, my patience is limited. I'm giving you a chance now, be obedient."

His voice was ambiguous and provocative.

Victoria shook her head, her eyes filled with humiliation and fear, her eyes red as she stared at him, "William, please."

Her pleading look only fueled William's desire to conquer.

He leaned down, forcefully prying open her teeth, gently entangling her tongue, savoring her.

Victoria resisted fiercely.

William held her waist with one hand and her head with the other, sucking her lips hard.

Victoria was kissed until she was dizzy, her brain deprived of oxygen, struggling to breathe.

He pressed her against the headboard, his eyes red.

Victoria panted, her chest heaving violently, her eyes tightly closed, her eyelashes trembling.

Seeing her shy appearance, William felt his desire flared up. A strange agitation washed over his nerves, making him want to tear her apart immediately.

He propped himself up on the bed, leaning down to kiss Victoria's lips again, while his right hand slipped under her clothes.

Touching her soft, slender waist, a part of his body ached with desire.

This Victoria always easily aroused his lust.

Victoria's hands were tied with the tie, unable to move, only able to let him do as he pleased.

William's actions were rough and wild, lifting her skirt halfway, revealing her round buttocks.

Her skin was smooth and delicate, like a porcelain doll, inviting caresses.

William's hand climbed up her skirt, covering her full breasts.

Victoria was made to feel numb all over, a heat rising in her lower abdomen. She couldn't help but clench her long, straight legs, biting her lip to suppress her moans.

Victoria's soft moans stimulated his senses.

His large hand slowly moved up along the groove.

Victoria's body grew hotter, her head tilted back, enduring the pleasure.

An indescribable sense of joy rose within her, making her intoxicated and scared.

All this wonderful feeling came from William.

He was like a poppy, making her addicted.

"William!" Victoria called out, her eyes filled with tears, looking incredibly seductive.

###chapter 75 Victoria, You Are Mine

William's Adam's apple bobbed as he growled and thrust forcefully into Victoria, entering her without any hindrance, riding her wildly.

This feeling was unfamiliar yet thrilling. Victoria squirmed restlessly, her bound hands clawing at the sheets, her entire body becoming extremely sensitive in this position.

Victoria's reaction pleased William. As he took her, he whispered in her ear, "You're so tight!"

Victoria couldn't help but moan out loud.

William's large hand moved to the back of her head, pressing her shoulder, forcing her to meet his thrusts.

He kissed Victoria's neck while breathing heavily.

"William!" Victoria called out his name, her body filled by him.

William's breathing grew heavier.

His hands lifted her hips, thrusting into her forcefully again and again.

Victoria's eyes were wet; she gritted her teeth to endure, but couldn't resist the pleasure and joy he brought her.

Her arms clung tightly around his neck, her cheeks flushed, her eyes misty, her mouth letting out broken moans, each one making William move faster.

William flipped Victoria over, making her back rest against the headboard, her hips raised high. He thrust again, the deep and shallow rhythm merging their bodies into one.

He pounded into her body repeatedly. Victoria had long lost control, helplessly moaning, crying out, "William, William!"

"Victoria, you're mine!" William whispered in her ear, crashing into her in waves.

Her body convulsed from the impact, almost falling apart. Her arms gripped the headboard tightly, her lips slightly parted, letting out whimpering moans.

William's eyes were bloodshot, the beast within him awakened by her. He kept attacking, withdrawing, and entering again.

Since their last encounter in the car by the river, he hadn't relieved himself for a long time.

Even though Alice lived in the room next to his, he never felt any sexual desire for her.

He just wanted to cherish her.

Unlike Victoria, just looking at her could ignite his inner desire.

Victoria's forehead was beaded with sweat, her face flushed, her body trembling violently with each thrust. Her tense legs gradually bent under William's powerful thrusts.

Her delicate toes curled tightly, her body trembling uncontrollably.

She looked especially alluring like this.

"Victoria, call me, I want to hear you call my name." William said, thrusting again, making Victoria's body convulse.

He lifted her legs, placing them on his shoulders, thrusting forcefully. Victoria screamed sharply, her body shivering, tears in her eyes as she looked at William, her body trembling continuously.

"William!" Victoria cried out his name.

William's eyes lit up instantly, and his semen uncontrollably spurting out.

Victoria was also sent to the peak, collapsing on the bed, exhausted.

William didn't withdraw immediately, staying inside Victoria.

He placed her bound hands around his neck, then carried her into a bathtub filled with warm water.

Victoria leaned tiredly against William, slowly opening her eyes.

William held her hip with one hand, taking the shower gel with the other, applying it to her body.

"Don't move!" His hoarse voice carried a hint of laziness.

Victoria's body was soft and tender, he had just tested it. Her skin was smoother than milk.

His fingers glided over her delicate skin, he loved the feeling of touching her.

Victoria's body couldn't help but tremble, even his light touch could evoke different emotions in her.

"Victoria, your body is indeed sensitive." He whispered ambiguously, deliberately sliding his hand between her legs, guiding her to feel his presence.

Victoria's body grew stiffer.

William knew she was sensitive, and he deliberately rubbed his penis against Victoria, slowly pushing it in a bit. Victoria couldn't help but moan softly.

Having relieved himself once, he was no longer as rough and wild as before, but very gentle.

Victoria moaned softly, "William!"

William adjusted her to sit properly, his hands threading through her smooth hair.

"Victoria, be good." He coaxed softly in her ear.

Victoria nodded, obediently cooperating with his movements. Despite their intimate actions, Victoria didn't feel any resistance.

William looked at her obedient expression, unable to help but smile.

He thrust heavily into her, enjoying their connection, whispering in her ear, "Do you like it?"

Victoria was too shy to nod, her eyes filled with emotion, her demeanor seductive.

Her body kept moving, growing increasingly empty and unbearable. She couldn't help but sigh softly, "William!"

Her voice excited him even more, unable to hold back, he thrust heavily a few more times, then withdrew.

Victoria's panting grew more obvious, her hands clinging to William's broad back, a shy and inviting look on her face.

William found it irresistible, thrusting into her again.

It wasn't until late at night that William finally let her go.

Victoria was extremely tired, sleeping deeply, motionless, her body pressed tightly against his chest, their hearts close, exchanging heartbeats.

William watched her for a moment, then leaned down to kiss the corner of her mouth, wiping her clean.

He held her, lying on the bed, quietly watching her.

After a long time, he dressed himself and left, closing the door behind him.

Victoria heard the door close, gently opening her eyes.

She stared at the ceiling, her heart filled with mixed emotions.

After a long time, she closed her eyes, a bitter smile forming at the corner of her mouth.

The main interior design and layout of the home goods department store building was complete. On the opening day, Victoria and her colleagues from Starry Studio Gallery were busy all day.

When Victoria finally had a moment to check her phone, she found several missed calls from Elara.

Victoria immediately called Elara back.

"Victoria, why couldn't I reach you earlier?" Elara asked anxiously.

"Elara, I was busy with work. What's wrong?" Victoria asked, puzzled.

"I saw Bobby opening the door to your house earlier. Since he's your brother, I didn't stop him. I tried calling you, but couldn't get through." Elara said worriedly.

Bobby?

Victoria felt a pang of unease.

Why did Bobby have her house key?

What was he doing at her place?

"Victoria?" Elara called out, concerned.

Victoria quickly calmed herself, reassuring, "Elara, don't worry about him. I'll head home right away."

###chapter 76 I Am No Longer Your Puppet

After hanging up the phone, Victoria immediately packed her things and went home.

The department store was quite remote, and it was an hour later by the time Victoria got home.

Elara was waiting outside the apartment building. When she saw Victoria return, she immediately came up to her.

"Victoria, why are you just getting back? Bobby has already left, and I couldn't stop him," Elara said anxiously.

Victoria frowned, "Left? Did he take anything with him?"

"He seemed to have taken a few paintings. I tried to stop him, but he's strong and fast," Elara said helplessly.

"Paintings?" Victoria was shocked. Without saying another word to Elara, she hurried upstairs.

Victoria opened the door and saw the place in disarray, with drawers and cabinets rummaged through.

Paintings were scattered all over the floor.

Victoria quickly picked up all the paintings and carefully checked them, finding that several of her better works from the past six months were missing.

More importantly, Bobby had taken the painting she was going to enter into the art association competition!

Victoria could hardly believe that Bobby would do something so despicable!

She felt a surge of anger, her chest tight and her vision darkening, almost fainting on the spot.

Elara was frightened and quickly ran over to support Victoria, "Victoria, are you okay?"

Victoria steadied her emotions and shook her head, "Elara, I'm fine."

Victoria clenched her fists in anger. Bobby had come to steal her paintings again, and she couldn't let this go!

Victoria took out her phone and called Bobby.

But after several attempts, he didn't answer.

Victoria decided not to waste any more time. She told Elara and then turned to head to the apartment Nora had bought for Bobby.

She had to find Bobby and ask him where he had taken her paintings.

Victoria arrived at the apartment door and rang the doorbell, but Bobby didn't answer.

She rang the doorbell several more times.

Still no response. Victoria angrily kicked the door several times before turning to head to Nora's hospital room.

Nora was sitting on the bed eating when she saw Victoria come in. Her expression changed slightly, "Victoria, you're here?"

Victoria glared coldly at Nora, "Tell me, where did Bobby take my paintings?"

Nora feigned ignorance, "I don't understand what you're talking about."

Victoria sneered, "Mom, don't play dumb with me. Bobby went to my house to steal my paintings! Where did he get the key? Wasn't it the one I gave you?"

Nora's face immediately darkened, "Victoria, are you crazy? What key and paintings? I don't know what you're talking about!"

"You know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm warning you, if you don't return my paintings, I'll call the police," Victoria threatened coldly.

"Victoria, I raised you for twenty years, and this is how you repay me? Do you have any conscience?" Nora angrily accused Victoria.

Victoria smirked disdainfully, her tone icy, "You raised me for twenty years? Dad earned the money, and the maid took care of me. What did you do for me? Beat me, scold me, and use me as a stepping stone for your precious son? I don't understand why you did all this. You don't like me, you despise me, so why did you give birth to me? Do you not know who painted the works Bobby won awards for?"

Nora's face turned pale, her eyes glaring venomously at Victoria, "What nonsense are you talking about! Of course, Bobby painted those himself."

Victoria laughed mockingly. She should have known that no matter what, Nora would always side with Bobby.

Victoria couldn't be bothered with her. She took out her phone and prepared to call the police.

"What are you doing?" Nora immediately reached out to grab Victoria's phone.

Victoria couldn't dodge in time, and the phone was smashed to the ground, the screen shattering.

Victoria looked at the broken phone for a moment, then coldly stared at Nora, "I'm telling you, don't think you can use me anymore! I'm no longer your puppet to manipulate!"

"Victoria!" Nora shouted angrily, "It's just a painting. Do you have to make such a fuss and disrupt the family?"

Victoria coldly stared at Nora, "Mom, I'll throw those words right back at your precious son."

Nora suddenly raised her hand and slapped Victoria hard. She shouted angrily, "You ungrateful girl, you dare defy me!"

As soon as she finished that, she slapped Victoria again.

Caught off guard, Victoria was slapped on both cheeks, which immediately swelled and bled at the corners of her mouth.

She held her painful cheeks, staring at Nora with a deep sense of grievance.

Nora looked at the red handprints on Victoria's face, a flicker of guilt in her eyes, but it quickly disappeared.

She coldly said, "Those slaps are to teach you to respect your elders. Do you think you can flaunt yourself just because you've seduced a few rich and powerful men?"

Victoria stared at Nora, her shoulders trembling, tears welling up but refusing to fall.

She coldly said, "You're my mom, so I'll endure those slaps. But I have no obligation to Bobby. Even if you broke my phone, I can still go to the police. I have witnesses and surveillance footage. I don't believe he can get away."

Nora's face twisted with rage, "You dare!"

Victoria fearlessly met Nora's gaze, "I dare because I owe you nothing, and I owe Bobby nothing. Why wouldn't I dare?"

Nora was furious. She raised her hand to slap Victoria again.

This time, Victoria quickly grabbed Nora's arm and pushed her onto the bed.

"How dare you!" Nora screamed hysterically, her eyes filled with hatred.

Victoria glanced at the furious Nora and coldly laughed, "How dare I? When you and Bobby bullied me, did you think about how dare you? Today, I'm daring. What can you do about it?"

"Victoria, you dare treat me like this?" Nora trembled with rage, her face contorted, "If you dare go to the police, I'll post all your scandals with William online and let everyone see how shameless Joshua's student is!"

Nora was completely desperate. She wouldn't allow Victoria to harm Bobby!

"You! You!" Victoria trembled with anger.

Nora pressed on, "If you dare report it, we'll both go down!"

###chapter 77 Please Help Him One Last Time

Victoria's chest heaved with anger, her eyes red with hatred as Nora once again used this to threaten her.

It seemed that once Nora had something on her, she could control her forever, constantly tormenting her.

Victoria suddenly calmed down, staring coldly at Nora, and slowly said, "Do you think I'll be afraid of that?"

A mocking smile appeared on Victoria's lips, her eyes sharp as if they were laced with blades.

Nora's heart pounded; she had never seen Victoria like this, as if she had suddenly become a different person.

She stammered in panic, "Don't scare me!"

Victoria sneered, "So there are times when you're afraid of me?"

She picked up the phone with the shattered screen, tried it, and found it still barely usable.

She swiped through it, opened her private Instagram, and scrolled to a post from a few years ago.

She clicked on the picture and held it up to Nora's face, saying, "Look for yourself."

Nora leaned in, puzzled, and when she saw the photo on the screen, she was stunned.

It was Bobby's winning piece from the national art competition, but Victoria had posted it long before he entered the contest.

"You didn't know, did you? I've always had a habit of recording my work on Instagram. If Bobby doesn't return the painting to me, I'll expose that he stole my work to enter the competition. Let's see if he can ever make it in the art world again."

Nora shouted furiously, "Victoria, you're despicable!"

"Despicable? I'm nothing compared to your precious son, who steals as if it's second nature," Victoria retorted sarcastically. "Didn't you say you wanted to go down together? Fine, you expose me for seducing men, and I'll expose your son for stealing my work. Neither of us will come out unscathed."

Nora was speechless, glaring at Victoria with gritted teeth, "What will it take for you to let Bobby go?"

Victoria sneered, "Unless Bobby kneels before me, admits his mistake, and returns the painting, I won't let this go!"

"You, you're delusional!" Nora was furious, her face turning red.

Victoria sneered, "In that case, let's go down together."

Nora gritted her teeth in anger, "Victoria, don't push me!"

"You pushed me first," Victoria said firmly, leaving no room for argument.

Nora trembled with rage, "Fine, fine. You're ruthless!"

Victoria no longer wanted to waste words with her and turned to leave, heading to the police station to report the incident.

As she stepped out of the hospital room, Nora suddenly shouted, "Wait!"

Victoria stopped and turned to look at her.

Nora stared at her without blinking, then suddenly bent her knees and knelt before Victoria.

"Mom!" Victoria's pupils contracted in shock, unable to believe what she was seeing.

She rushed over to help her up.

Nora was sobbing uncontrollably, choking out, "Victoria, I'm begging you, please spare Bobby! The teacher from the training team at the University of Aesthetics Shine said his technique is fine but his expressiveness is lacking. If he wants to get into the training team, he needs to submit a decent piece."

She continued, tears streaming down her face, "Please help him this one last time. If he can get into the University of Aesthetics Shine, I'll do anything you ask."

Victoria stared blankly at Nora.

She never expected Nora to kneel before her for Bobby.

Where did that leave her, as her daughter?

Nora wiped her tears and continued to plead, "I know I've wronged you in the past. You're a forgiving person, please help him this one last time. I promise I won't trouble you again."

Victoria's fists clenched at her sides, her nails digging into her palms, leaving five clear marks.

She closed her eyes, forcing back her tears.

After a long while, she opened her eyes, her expression indifferent, and said, "Mom, this is the last time I'll help him. From now on, we won't interfere with each other. I hope you keep your promise and don't trouble me again."

Her voice was light, as if it could dissipate at any moment.

Nora's face lit up with joy, and she quickly agreed.

She had originally thought Victoria would make a big fuss. But to her surprise, as soon as she knelt down, Victoria backed down. She was secretly relieved that she knew how to be both flexible and resilient.

Victoria gave her one last deep look before turning and quickly leaving the hospital room.

She feared that if she delayed any longer, she would break down and cry in front of Nora, questioning why she treated her this way. 

After all, she was her biological daughter.

But Victoria knew that even if she cried herself to death in front of Nora, she wouldn't be moved in the slightest.

Victoria had never understood so deeply as she did now that Nora didn't love her, not one bit.

She was just a pawn to be used and discarded at will.

Victoria walked slowly on her way home, unable to hold back her tears any longer. She covered her face and squatted by the roadside, sobbing uncontrollably.

Passersby stopped to watch, but Victoria seemed oblivious.

When she was too tired to cry, she sat on the steps by the roadside, letting the wind blow through her disheveled hair.

After a long time, she composed herself, took out her phone with the broken screen, and dialed Samuel's number.

The phone rang for a while before it was answered, and a familiar, deep, and sexy voice came through, gently asking, "Victoria, what's wrong?"

Victoria sniffled, her voice hoarse, and asked softly, "Samuel, I can't participate in the art association's competition."

There was a few seconds of silence on the other end before Samuel's warm voice came through, "Can you tell me why?"

Victoria hesitated for a moment before slowly explaining the situation to him.

"I'm sorry, Samuel, I've let you down," Victoria choked out.

Samuel's voice came through the phone, a low sigh, "Victoria, whether you participate or not, I believe you have the talent to win."

Hearing his encouragement and praise, Victoria's nose stung even more, "Thank you, Samuel."

Samuel sighed again, "Victoria, there's no need for thanks between us, but I have a suggestion for you. Would you like to hear it?"

Victoria immediately nodded, "Okay."

"The competition doesn't limit the type of artwork. Although there are only a few days left until the competition deadline, and there's no time to paint a large oil painting, you could try using sketches; it might have unexpected results," Samuel suggested.

###chapter 78 Finding a Touch of Warmth

"Using sketching?" Victoria repeated his words.

Sketching indeed doesn't require much effort, but it demands a high level of creativity and expressiveness, so Victoria wasn't very confident.

Seeing Victoria's hesitation, Samuel added, "It doesn't matter if you win an award or not, just do your best. I just think that if you use sketching, you might really have a breakthrough."

Victoria pressed her lips and thought for a moment, then finally nodded and said, "Alright, Samuel, I'll do my best!"

After hanging up the phone, Victoria stood up, wiped the tears from her face, patted the dust off her clothes, and headed home.

No matter how difficult it is, no matter if she doesn't get the desired result, she will give it her all.

Back home, she sat in front of her drawing board, gazing at the distant skyscrapers and traffic, and some fragmented images began to form in her mind.

After a long time, she picked up a charcoal pencil and started sketching on the paper.

She stayed up all night, and the once blank paper gradually revealed the images in Victoria's mind.

Most of the picture was of a bustling city's skyscrapers, the concrete jungle appearing cold and oppressive under the gray tones.

The sharp lines and distinct edges spoke of the city's fast pace and sense of alienation.

In the corner of the picture was a small street-side coffee shop.

Warm light spilled out from the windows, illuminating a few tables and chairs at the entrance.

An old man sat there quietly, watching the passersby, his eyes full of stories.

Beside him, a stray cat curled up, enjoying the moment of peace.

Victoria used delicate lines to outline the old man's wrinkles and the stray cat's fur.

The coffee shop's sign was carefully drawn, with the lettering slightly worn, yet exuding a sense of timeless charm.

On the city's streets, Victoria drew people walking hurriedly, their figures blurred and busy, contrasting sharply with the tranquility of the old man and the stray cat.

At the top of the picture, Victoria drew a faint moon with light lines, its moonlight spilling over every corner of the city, as if bringing a touch of solace to the lonely city.

At the bottom of the picture, she wrote a small line: "Find a touch of warmth in the hustle and bustle."

Victoria stopped her pencil, her gaze fixed on that line of small text, unable to look away for a long time.

She didn't know if her painting would win an award, but she had no regrets about trying.

The next day was Saturday, and Victoria took her painting to Samuel's studio.

Seeing her eyes with dark circles, Samuel raised an eyebrow, his tone a mix of surprise and concern, "Did you stay up all night painting?"

Victoria nodded lightly.

Samuel frowned, his tone filled with reproach and concern, "Even if you're in a hurry, don't push yourself like this. Your health isn't great, what if you get sick?"

Victoria forced a smile and explained, "I couldn't sleep, so I just finished it. Samuel, look, how did I do? What needs to be revised?"

Only then did Samuel start to carefully examine Victoria's painting.

His gaze was focused and serious, as if trying to see into the depths of Victoria's heart through the painting.

After a long time, Samuel nodded slightly, his tone carrying a hint of praise, "Overall, this painting has a lot of potential. It's both creative and full of expression. That said, there are a couple of areas where it could be refined."

He pointed to the skyscrapers in the painting, "The lines here can be more refined to highlight the texture and three-dimensionality of the buildings. Also, the tones can be colder to better reflect the city's indifference."

Then he looked at the street-side coffee shop area, "The lighting effect of the coffee shop can be enhanced to make the warm atmosphere more intense. The interaction between the old man and the stray cat can be more natural to add liveliness to the painting."

"Additionally, the background can be blurred a bit to make the main subjects stand out more."

After saying all this, Samuel looked at Victoria's eyes with dark circles, feeling a pang of heartache, "Victoria, your effort and talent are very touching. But don't push yourself so hard in the future. Your health is the foundation of your creativity; you must take care of yourself."

Victoria lowered her eyes and responded softly, "Okay."

Under Samuel's guidance, Victoria began to carefully revise her work.

She meticulously adjusted every detail, striving to make the painting the best it could be.

When she was too tired, she would rest her head on the studio table for a short nap.

Samuel watched her exhausted state, couldn't help but shake his head, sighed with heartache, and draped a blanket over her.

Victoria only slept for half an hour before getting up to continue adjusting her work.

It wasn't until nightfall that she finally finished the revisions, leaning back in her chair, rubbing her sore neck.

She stretched, moved her stiff limbs, and looked to the side, only to see Samuel's smiling eyes.

Samuel handed her a cup, gently saying, "Have some tea."

Victoria took it, holding the cup, sipping lightly, "Samuel, thank you."

Samuel chuckled, "What's with the thanks between us?"

Victoria was slightly taken aback by his words, then smiled gently without saying anything.

Samuel drove Victoria home, reminding her to rest well before leaving.

Although Victoria felt physically exhausted, her spirits were high. She was about to take a bath and get a good night's sleep when she suddenly received a call from an unknown number.

She hesitated before answering, "Who is this?"

A woman's voice came from the other end, "Ms. Carter, it's Alice."

Victoria's hand holding the phone paused for a moment, then she calmly said, "Ms. Garcia, hello."

"Ms. Carter, do you remember what I mentioned to you at Aroma Garden Eatery last time?"

"I remember."

Alice's voice became cheerful, "Tomorrow is my friend's bar opening, you promised me and Daisy to come and join us."

Victoria hesitated for a moment but eventually agreed.

It wasn't surprising that Alice would contact her.

A woman's intuition was always accurate.

How could she be indifferent to her boyfriend having an affair with another woman?

Alice probably wanted to keep her away from William by inviting her and Daisy out.

That works too, she could use Alice's difficulty to stay away from him.

He cherished Alice so much, he wouldn't want to hurt her again, right?

Victoria smiled bitterly.

After hanging up, Alice stood by the window, looking at William's garden, a smile playing on her lips.

William happened to hear her call, frowned, and asked in a steady voice, "You invited Victoria to the bar?"

Alice put away her phone, turned around, her cheeks flushed, her big eyes curved like crescents, "Yes, I think Victoria is a nice girl. I don't have many friends in Silvermist City, so I thought I'd make a new friend."

"Don't be ridiculous!" William said helplessly, "How is she fit to be your friend?"

Alice stared into his eyes, her lips curling up, smiling as she asked, "It's just making a friend, what's unfit about it? Or is it that you still have something with her, so you don't want me to get in touch with her?"

###chapter 79 Are You Still Thinking About William?

William's pupils instantly contracted, and a deep, unfathomable cold light flashed in his eyes. "What nonsense are you thinking? I have nothing to do with her anymore!"

Alice saw William's reaction and sneered inwardly, but her face remained unchanged.

She pouted and said coquettishly, "Then why are you stopping me from being friends with Victoria? Besides, Daisy is there too."

William pondered for a moment and then slowly said, "Since you insist on going, go ahead. I'll have Harry take you tomorrow."

Alice's smile grew even brighter. "Thank you, William."

William said nothing more and went upstairs to change his clothes.

Watching his upright figure disappear around the corner, Alice's smile gradually faded, and her eyes darkened.

Daisy originally didn't want to go to any bar.

But when she heard Alice say that Victoria would be there, she felt something was off.

However, last time Victoria suddenly fell ill, and she was busy taking her to the doctor and forgot to get her contact information.

So, she had no choice but to go to the bar.

When Victoria arrived at the bar, Daisy and Alice had already ordered their drinks and were sitting in a booth waiting for her.

Victoria smiled apologetically. "Sorry to keep you waiting."

Daisy waved her hand with a smile. "It's okay."

Alice pulled her arm enthusiastically and invited her to sit. "Come over and sit down. What would you like to drink?"

Victoria looked at the seats and sat on the other side, with Daisy in between, and said, "Just a glass of Moscato for me."

Alice glanced at Daisy sitting next to her and smiled. "Alright."

Then she called out to the waiter. "Waiter, a glass of Moscato."

Victoria took a sip. Moscato is a slightly sparkling wine with a rich fruity sweetness, almost like juice, and it's Victoria's favorite kind of wine.

Daisy looked at her and smiled. "Just like your dad, you can only drink low-alcohol wine, or you'll get drunk quickly."

Victoria was slightly stunned, then pulled the corners of her mouth bitterly without saying anything.

Alice was surprised to hear Daisy's words and asked, "Daisy, you know Ms. Carter's dad?"

Daisy nodded without saying much.

Alice didn't mind and looked at Victoria with a teasing smile. "Ms. Carter is still single. The bar is having a singles matching event tonight. Do you want to join?"

Victoria was taken aback and smiled reluctantly. "No, I'm not used to it."

Alice looked at her and teased. "Could it be that Ms. Carter still has feelings for William?"

The tone was joking, but both Victoria and Daisy knew what she meant.

Daisy glanced at her and said lightly. "Alice, don't talk nonsense. William has a bad and stubborn temper, only you like him. Victoria doesn't care for him at all."

Alice raised her eyebrows and pretended to be clueless. "Really?"

Seeing Daisy's face turn cold, she immediately raised her hands in surrender. "Alright, alright, pretend I didn't say anything. Ms. Carter, let's go dance."

Victoria felt a bit awkward by her words, and when Alice pulled her to the dance floor, she couldn't refuse and reluctantly followed.

She had learned dance for a while as a child but never dared to try swaying her hips in front of everyone.

Alice had studied abroad for a few years and seemed pure and reserved, but she was much more uninhibited than Victoria, pulling her to dance wildly in the dance floor, attracting the attention of many men.

With a sudden exclamation, Alice stepped on Victoria's foot, twisted hard, and then let go of her.

Victoria stumbled back two or three steps, almost falling.

Alice's lips curled slightly, and just as Victoria was about to fall, she caught her and steadied her.

While Victoria wasn't paying attention, she secretly slipped a small packet into her pocket.

After one dance, Alice excused herself, saying she was tired, and went back to the booth to drink.

Victoria breathed a sigh of relief, sat on the sofa to rest, and chatted with Daisy.

After two drinks, Alice excused herself that she felt a bit stuffy, and went out for some fresh air.

Victoria watched her leave, deep in thought.

Daisy also looked at Alice's back suspiciously and murmured, "What's up with her? She's acting weird."

Victoria shook her head, indicating she didn't know.

She thought Alice had invited her out to test her relationship with William.

But all night, Alice only mentioned him once and said nothing else.

Was she trying to get her drunk and then get information out of her?

Victoria's mind was a bit muddled. She felt like a guilty thief, always worried about being caught, but also thinking it would be good if Alice could control William.

That way, she would be free.

This contradiction made Victoria a bit anxious.

But after waiting for almost half an hour, Alice still hadn't returned.

Daisy called her, but there was no answer.

Victoria frowned, suddenly having a bad feeling.

Thinking of this, she quickly got up and walked outside to see if Alice was there.

Just as she reached the door, the music suddenly stopped, and the dim bar lights were all turned on.

People who had been dancing to the music stopped and looked around in surprise.

Daisy stood on the steps, looking around with a serious expression.

Victoria also sensed something was wrong and looked towards the door, following Daisy's gaze.

She saw seven or eight police officers file in, quickly sealing off all the exits of the bar.

A police officer who looked like the leader walked over, glanced at the bar's patrons, and said in a deep voice, "Everyone, stand against the wall. We will conduct a search on you."

Daisy and Victoria exchanged a glance and followed the instructions, standing in a line against the wall.

The police searched each person one by one.

Soon, it was Victoria's turn.

Victoria clenched her fists, trying to stay calm, letting the policewoman search her.

She had a feeling this unexpected check was aimed at her.

Her right hand was tightly clenched, her palm sweaty.

Her heart was pounding like a drum.

The policewoman searched her upper body and then moved to her pockets.

This position made Victoria feel particularly ashamed, especially in front of everyone.

She tried hard to endure, controlling her urge to push the policewoman away.

Just as she was about to breathe a sigh of relief, the policewoman's hand suddenly stopped.

Victoria's heart tightened.

The policewoman took out a packet of white powder and held it in front of Victoria, saying in a deep voice, "What is this?"

Victoria's pupils contracted sharply, and her face instantly turned pale.

###chapter 80 Why Were There Drugs in Your Pocket?

She tried to stay rational and shook her head, "I don't know where this came from."

Daisy had already been searched and was terrified by the scene. She quickly stood up to intervene, "Officer, this might be a misunderstanding."

The female officer's eyes flashed with coldness as she looked at her, "Shut up! Who allowed you to interrupt? Do you want me to take you in as well?"

Daisy's face stiffened, and she reluctantly closed her mouth.

Victoria took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down, and said frankly, "This is indeed not mine. I can go with you to investigate."

The female officer took out handcuffs and cuffed her, taking her away.

Before leaving, Victoria, holding back her fear, looked at Daisy with red-rimmed eyes.

Daisy looked at her with heartache and said softly, "Don't be afraid. Leave the rest to me. I will get you out as soon as possible."

Victoria bit her lip, tears rolling down her cheeks, and nodded vigorously before being taken away by the police.

Seeing Victoria being taken away, Daisy felt like she was about to explode with anger.

She took out her phone and called Alice again, but there was still no answer.

Holding back her anger, she dialed William's number.

The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered. She grabbed her bag and rushed out, bumping into a waiter on the way, spilling the drinks on the tray.

"I'm sorry, miss, really sorry."

Daisy didn't have time to argue with the waiter and hurried to the garage.

She continued to call William several times, but still, no one answered.

Daisy was so furious that she almost smashed her phone, cursing, "Damn William!"

She was about to drive to the police station when she remembered she had been drinking as she touched the steering wheel.

With no other choice, she went out to hail a cab.

By the time she got a cab, it was completely dark.

The night breeze cleared her slightly dizzy mind a bit, and she stopped the futile attempts to call William, instead calling Harry.

Harry answered the phone quickly.

Daisy asked bluntly, "Where are William and Alice?"

On the other end, Harry hesitated for a moment, then said in a hoarse voice, "What do you need Mr. Scott for?"

"Cut the crap! Tell me where they are now!" Daisy shouted angrily.

Harry hesitated but finally answered honestly, "Ms. Garcia is in the hospital, and Mr. Scott is with her."

Daisy was stunned for a moment, then gritted her teeth, "Wasn't she fine just now? How did she end up in the hospital?"

"Ms. Garcia was drugged at the bar."

"Good job, Alice. I really underestimated her," Daisy said, suppressing her anger, and sneered, "So you all knew Victoria was taken by the police and deliberately didn't answer my calls, right?"

There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line.

After a while, Harry's voice came through, "We didn't know it was Ms. Carter who did it."

"Didn't know?" Daisy laughed angrily, "Don't tell me William couldn't figure out who was behind this."

Harry remained silent.

Daisy sneered, "Fine, I don't want to talk to you anymore. Tell William I will personally hold him accountable for this."

Hanging up the phone, Daisy punched the car seat hard and started calling her lawyer.

In the interrogation room, Victoria sat on a cold, hard metal chair, her fingers unconsciously intertwined.

Despite her efforts to appear calm, she couldn't stop trembling.

The female officer poured her a cup of water and said coldly, "Victoria, right? Cooperate with the investigation honestly to avoid suffering."

The cold white fluorescent light mercilessly illuminated the entire room, highlighting the pallor on Victoria's face.

The female officer glanced at her and then began to ask, "What is your name, age, occupation, home address?"

Victoria reported her information truthfully.

"Victoria, we need you to cooperate with our investigation. Please explain in detail what happened at the bar tonight."

Victoria took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.

Her voice carried a barely noticeable tremor, "Officer, I really didn't do anything. I just went to the bar with my friends to relax. I don't know how the drugs ended up on me."

The female officer continued, "Do you know Alice?"

Victoria nodded, "Yes, I went to the bar with her."

An older officer scrutinized her and continued to ask, "What is your relationship with Alice? Have you had any disagreements?"

Victoria shook her head, her voice weak, "We are just ordinary friends. Before tonight, we never had any disputes."

The older officer then asked, "So why were there drugs in your pocket? Can you explain that?"

Victoria's face turned even paler, her lips trembling slightly as she tried to suppress her inner panic, "I don't know how those drugs got into my pocket. I swear, I have never touched those things."

The two officers exchanged a glance and continued to ask, "Did you leave your seat at any point tonight? Or did you notice anyone suspicious approaching your seat?"

Victoria's heart raced, and she felt a wave of dizziness, but she forced herself to focus and recall, "I went to the restroom, but it was only for a short time. As for suspicious people, the bar was crowded, and I didn't notice anything unusual."

The older officer paused and then said, "We have a witness who says you had an intimate relationship with Alice's boyfriend. Did you try to harm her out of jealousy?"

Victoria's face turned ashen, her voice trembling, unable to form a complete sentence, "I, I..."

Seeing this, the older officer slammed the table and shouted, "Enough! We don't have time for your stammering!"

Victoria looked up at them in fear, seeing their serious expressions and eyes filled with anger.

Her breath caught, and she clenched her fists tightly, "I did have an intimate relationship with her boyfriend, but I never wanted to harm her, let alone use drugs to harm her."

The officers recorded every word Victoria said and then stated, "We will investigate all the evidence, including the bar's surveillance footage. Until the investigation is complete, you will need to stay at the police station."

After the interrogation, Victoria was taken back to the holding cell.

Victoria knew these accusations were Alice's schemes to frame her, but she had no evidence to prove her innocence.

She squatted against the wall, staring blankly at the darkening sky outside the window.

###chapter 81 Do You Think We're All Fools?

Meanwhile, Daisy also arrived at the police station. She went straight to the officer on duty and said, "I'm here to bail out Victoria. Please help me with the paperwork."

The officer on duty checked the records and then shook his head. "I'm sorry, ma'am, but she isn't eligible for bail right now. The case is still under investigation, and we can't release her right now."

Daisy's face darkened, and she raised her voice a bit. "Why? I can pay the highest bail amount. I want her out immediately."

The officer on duty, accustomed to such reactions from family members, remained calm.

He patiently explained to Daisy, "This case involves drugs, and someone has been hospitalized because of it. According to the rules, we can't release anyone until the investigation is complete."

Daisy was about to say something when her lawyer, Jagger, also arrived at the police station. He patted Daisy on the shoulder, signaling her to stay calm.

Jagger said to the officer on duty, "I am Ms. Scott's attorney. We need to know the progress of the case."

The officer on duty glanced at the records. "We are currently investigating the source of the drugs and the people involved."

Daisy's face turned red with anger. She turned to Jagger and asked urgently, "Is there really no way? Victoria is innocent. She's young and must be terrified."

Jagger whispered to Daisy, "Ms. Scott, please calm down. This matter can be serious. If the drug charges are confirmed, Victoria could face severe legal consequences. The most important thing now is to cooperate with the police investigation and find evidence in her favor."

Daisy took a deep breath, barely suppressing her anger, and then said to the officer, "I request a visit."

The officer hesitated for a second and then agreed. "Okay."

Victoria had never felt a wait this long before. She curled up in a corner, hugging her knees, with her head buried in them, tears streaming down her cheeks.

At that moment, the iron door suddenly made a noise. Victoria quickly looked up and saw Daisy standing outside the bars.

"Victoria!" Daisy's voice was filled with heartache when she saw Victoria's haggard and pale appearance. "Don't be afraid. I will get you out as soon as possible."

Victoria pressed her dry lips together and choked out, "Ms. Scott, thank you for coming to help me."

Daisy reached out to touch her cold, stiff cheek and softly comforted her, "I was there almost the whole time yesterday, except when you and Alice went to the dance floor. Can you tell me if anything unusual happened?"

Victoria thought carefully and said, "Nothing special, just that she suddenly tripped me while we were dancing, and I almost fell. She then pulled me back. And then..."

At this point, Victoria hesitated, her eyes turning red as if she wanted to cry but held back her tears.

Seeing this, Daisy sighed and patted Victoria's shoulder. "Alright, don't worry. I've already hired a lawyer for you."

Victoria bit her lip lightly. "Ms. Scott, I'm sorry for causing you trouble."

Daisy shook her head with a smile. "Silly girl, it's the Scott family that caused you trouble. You are the victim."

Victoria felt a lump in her throat.

She knew very well who was behind this disaster, but from beginning to end, she never had a choice.

She was just a person with no support, at the mercy of the Scott family and the Garcia family.

Daisy found out from Harry which hospital Alice was in and hurried there.

In the hospital room, Daisy didn't see William, only Alice lying in bed, which made her furious.

She walked to the bedside, grabbed Alice by the collar, and demanded, "Why did you do this?"

Alice's face was deathly pale, her lips blue, seemingly in unbearable pain.

Daisy's brow furrowed tightly. She let go of Alice and scolded, "Stop pretending! You set Victoria up, didn't you?"

"Daisy..." Alice called weakly, "Don't you believe me?"

Alice coughed violently and slowly said, "Daisy, you misunderstood. I was really drugged. I felt dizzy and panicked as soon as I left the bar and rushed to the hospital..."

Daisy was about to say something when the door was kicked open.

William rushed in with medicine in hand, anxiously asking, "How are you now?"

Alice gave him a weak smile and replied, "I'm just a bit dizzy, nothing serious."

Then she turned her head to look at Daisy, sadly saying, "Daisy, I know you blame me. I regret it too. If I had known it was Victoria, I wouldn't have called the police!"

Daisy laughed in anger. "Do you think we're all fools?"

She couldn't believe that Alice would resort to self-harm to frame Victoria.

She was ruthless to others and to herself.

It was truly terrifying.

How could William like such a venomous person?

Alice's face grew even paler, and she continued coughing, shaking her head. "I'm not lying!"

Seeing this, William quickly stopped Daisy from questioning further, his brow furrowed. "Aunt Daisy, she's still sick. Let's talk outside."

Daisy glared at Alice before following William out of the room.

In the hospital corridor, Daisy looked at William's detestable face, wanting to slap him.

"William, I don't believe you can't see who's behind this," Daisy scolded. "Do you know Victoria could be sentenced?"

"I'll handle this. You stay out of it."

Daisy was furious. "Stay out of it? William, you're insane. You forced such a young girl into a relationship with you, and now she's facing serious charges because of you, and you want me to do nothing?"

William frowned. "Don't worry. It's just a lesson. She won't actually go to jail."

Daisy sneered. "How kind of you. But have you thought about how scared Victoria is now? She's linked to drugs. If people find out, how will she live? William, you and Alice are heartless!"

William had nothing to say, only grunting. "Anyway, I'll handle it."

Daisy was livid and pushed him hard. "I don't care what you do. Victoria must be released by tomorrow morning, or I'll tell your grandfather everything!"

###chapter 82 I Brought This on Myself

Upon hearing this, William's eyes suddenly changed. He stared at Daisy gloomily, his tone sharp and cold, "Don't tell Grandpa about these things. His health is already poor."

Daisy sneered, "What, did I hit a sore spot?"

William did not respond, a complex emotion faintly flickering in his deep eyes.

After a while, he spoke lightly, "Don't worry, Victoria will be out by tomorrow morning."

Daisy snorted coldly and walked away.

Victoria hadn't slept all night, staring intently at the door of the detention room.

She was very scared, afraid that she would really end up like Alvin, being arrested and sent to prison.

Her eyes, swollen from crying all night, were already as puffy as walnuts, her nose was red, and her face was pale, with dark circles under her eyes.

She lowered her head, her expression stiff, constantly rubbing her fingertips, as if this could reduce a bit of fear and despair.

In the morning, the door of the detention room opened again, and a police officer appeared at the door, coldly announcing, "Victoria, you can go."

Upon hearing this, Victoria's eyes widened in surprise. She asked blankly, "You said, I can go?"

The police officer repeated expressionlessly, "You can go."

Victoria signed the papers in a daze and walked out of the police station.

As soon as she stepped out of the police station, her tears burst out uncontrollably-she was saved! Finally freed!

Victoria walked down the steps in a daze, almost missing a step and falling.

William was sitting in the car, watching her tears roll down her face like broken pearls, his heart inexplicably tightening.

He drove the car in front of Victoria, rolled down the window, and was about to call her to get in.

Sitting next to him was Alice, who insisted on coming to pick up Victoria despite her discomfort. She spoke first, "Ms. Carter."

Victoria suddenly looked up, her gaze meeting William's and Alice's. She was stunned for a few seconds, then quickly looked away, wiped her tears, and turned to leave.

Seeing this, William hurriedly called out to Victoria, "Get in the car."

Victoria's back stiffened. She didn't turn around, only said softly, "No need, thank you. I'll go back by myself."

"Ms. Carter, are you mad at me?" Alice's charming voice reached Victoria's ears, her tone full of deep apology, "I'm really sorry, it's all because of me that you suffered."

Victoria's steps suddenly halted, but she didn't speak.

Looking at Alice's innocent face, her heart sank to the bottom.

She finally remembered what Ella had told her-Alice is a lunatic, she won't let you go.

And she remembered the hideous scar on Ella's body.

She felt a chill all over.

This Alice was terrifying, like a venomous snake lurking in the grass, silently flicking its tongue.

The moment you let your guard down, it would pounce and bite you to death.

Seeing her like this, William was immediately annoyed, "Haven't we already let you out? Alice suffered so much and still came to pick you up personally, what more do you want?"

Victoria gritted her teeth, trying hard to suppress the anger surging inside her, and said hoarsely, "I don't want anything. Please don't disturb my life anymore! I just want to live my life in peace."

With that, Victoria dared not stay any longer and ran towards the roadside.

She ran so fast that she accidentally twisted her ankle and stumbled to the ground, looking both pitiful and pathetic.

William hurriedly pushed open the car door to help her up, not noticing Alice's venomous gaze behind him.

Her gaze was fixed on Victoria, as if she wanted to carve a piece of flesh out of her.

William helped Victoria stand up, sighing lightly, "Victoria, Alice she..."

Looking at his handsome face, full of protection and favoritism for Alice, Victoria suddenly felt very pathetic.

She slowly lowered her head and said softly, "She's not wrong, I am. I shouldn't have gotten entangled with you, ruining your relationship. I deserve this; it's my own fault."

As she spoke, she couldn't help but choke up.

Seeing her cry, William felt irritated and impatiently said, "Victoria, enough! Stop talking!"

Victoria looked up at his eyes, her own eyes slightly wet, "First it was Ella, now it's Alice. Because of you, my life will never be peaceful. What did I do wrong to deserve this torment from you?"

William frowned, his thin lips slightly parted, wanting to say something but ultimately saying nothing.

Looking at his profile, Victoria murmured, "William, you're a bastard."

With that, she pushed William away and tried to leave.

However, William grabbed her wrist and forcefully pushed her into the car.

Seeing Alice's deep eyes, Victoria's struggling body suddenly stopped. She pressed her lips tightly and lowered her head, saying nothing.

Alice glanced at Victoria, then smiled elegantly at William, "Let's take Ms. Carter home quickly."

Victoria shrank her neck and sat in the back seat, silent, not looking at anyone.

Alice's lips curled into a mocking smile, then turned into a gentle smile, "Ms. Carter, you don't look well. Do you need me to take you to the hospital?"

Hearing this, Victoria suddenly looked up at her, her eyes red, "No need, I'll just rest at home. I don't want to trouble you and Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott is a good boss, but I don't want to be too much."

She believed that with Alice's intelligence, she would surely understand the underlying meaning of her words.

Sure enough, Alice's smile deepened, "Since you insists, we won't force you. How about this, I'll treat you to a meal on Saturday to apologize, how about that?"

"No need!" Victoria refused urgently, then added, "Thank you for your kindness, Ms. Garcia, but next Saturday, I have plans to go skiing with my boyfriend, so I really don't have time."

Upon hearing this, William's pupils suddenly contracted.

His grip on the steering wheel tightened.

Alice's eyes flickered, and she continued to probe, "When did you get a boyfriend, Ms. Carter?"

To dispel her targeting thoughts, Victoria replied, "He's the one who had dinner with me at Aroma Garden Eatery last time. He confessed to me, and I accepted."

"Really? You two are quite a match, congratulations." Alice deliberately elongated her words, her smile growing brighter.

"Indeed, a good match," William said lightly, his eyes dark.

Victoria only felt a chill down her spine.

Seeing his unpleasant expression, Alice's lips curled slightly, and she continued, "I haven't skied in a long time either. William, why don't we join them? The more, the merrier."

###chapter 83 Who Said It's Inconvenient?

Before William could respond, Victoria quickly interjected, "Mr. Scott is so busy, unlike us who are just idlers, it might not be convenient..."

She was just making up a lie, but Alice, in a bizarre move, insisted on joining her with William.

Could she be plotting something to harm her again?

"Who said it's not convenient?" Before Victoria could finish, William suddenly interrupted coldly, "I have nothing to do this weekend, I can go."

Victoria's eyes widened as she looked at William, a storm brewing in her heart. She opened her mouth, wanting to stop him. But just as she was about to speak, Alice beat her to it, "Great, William, I'm so happy you can come with me! Ms. Carter, you must introduce your boyfriend to us then."

Victoria was stunned for a moment, and finally could only nod helplessly.

Alice smiled with satisfaction, looking very pleased, while William remained silent, looking increasingly gloomy.

Back home, Victoria received a call from Daisy, confirming that she had been sent home by William, which made her breathe a sigh of relief.

Daisy told Victoria that there were some matters in Harborview City that needed her attention, and asked Victoria to take care of herself.

Victoria agreed to everything.

After hanging up the phone, Victoria lay on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Last night's experience was as absurd as a nightmare.

She was really scared.

Alice's methods were even more ruthless and vicious than Ella's.

To frame her, she even went so far as to poison herself.

Thinking about it, Victoria couldn't help but feel a chill in her heart.

How could she make Alice give up her malice towards her?

Victoria thought of the skiing date she had made up and decided to go through with it.

She took out her phone and called Samuel.

The phone rang for a few seconds before it was answered, and Samuel's clear voice came through, "Victoria."

Victoria called out somewhat uneasily, "Samuel."

Samuel heard the unusual tone in Victoria's voice and asked with concern, "What's wrong? Did something happen?"

Victoria hesitated whether to tell him about last night.

But thinking carefully, she didn't want him to know about her feud with Alice, in case Samuel got involved, she would feel guilty.

So she decided not to tell him about it, and just asked nervously, "Samuel, do you have time next weekend? My friend invited me to go skiing, do you want to come with me?"

Samuel immediately agreed cheerfully, "Of course, Victoria, I'm at your service."

Hearing Samuel's response, Victoria finally felt half relieved.

She exhaled a breath and said, "Okay, see you next weekend then."

When the appointed time came, Samuel drove to pick up Victoria and arrived at the foot of the snow mountain.

William and Alice were already there.

William was wearing a pure black ski suit, with a hat and sunglasses, standing there straight.

Alice was wearing a bright yellow down jacket today, with a brown knitted hat, a somewhat youthful outfit that looked particularly playful on her, especially highlighting her delicate skin and features.

William was gently adjusting her clothes, his eyes full of affection, as if honey was about to overflow.

Seeing this, Victoria suddenly felt a bit dazed.

Samuel parked the car and put the rabbit fur hat that Victoria had left in the car on her, and Victoria smiled embarrassedly.

Seeing their intimate interaction, Alice's mouth curved into a smile, and she glanced at William.

His handsome face showed no emotion, as if he hadn't noticed the interaction between Victoria and Samuel at all.

A mocking smile flashed in Alice's eyes, but it quickly disappeared, and she returned to her usual self.

She walked up to William, took his arm, and said with a smile, "William, let's go quickly."

Saying this, she pulled him to Victoria and Samuel, nodded slightly to Victoria, then turned to the mature and handsome Samuel, and said with a smile, "Mr. Brown, right? We met once at Aroma Garden Eatery."

Samuel nodded politely to her and said with a smile, "Yes, Ms. Garcia, hello."

William frowned at Samuel, a look of disgust flashing in his eyes, he put his arm around Alice's waist, nodded to Samuel, and said in a low voice, "Let's go, it's time to go up the mountain."

With that, he walked towards the ski field first.

Seeing this, Alice's smile deepened, she glanced at Victoria, then shyly leaned into William's arms, "William, slow down, be careful not to slip."

Watching their backs, Victoria also smiled sweetly at Samuel, "Let's go too."

The ski field was located on Snowflake Peak in the western suburbs of Silvermist City, covering a large area, with not only large camping tents, ski slopes, and other facilities, but also many amusement devices around.

The group took the cable car up, moving slowly.

Alice stayed close to William, occasionally chatting with him, looking very intimate.

Victoria pretended not to see, looking out at the snow through the window, occasionally chatting with Samuel and Alice.

After about half an hour, the cable car slowly descended, stopping at the top of the ski field.

Victoria opened the door and got off the cable car, immediately feeling a biting cold wind hit her face.

Samuel stepped forward, took out a mask and goggles from his coat pocket, and handed them to Victoria, "Victoria, put these on."

Victoria took the mask and goggles, gave Samuel a light smile, and then turned to put them on.

Seeing this, Alice smiled and said, "Mr. Brown is really considerate and thoughtful, Ms. Carter is so lucky to have such a boyfriend."

Victoria looked at Samuel somewhat awkwardly, not denying it.

Samuel was open and honest, smiling, "Ms. Garcia, you're too kind."

William said impatiently, "Are you done with the compliments? Are we skiing or not?"

Alice pouted, "Alright, alright, you're the most impatient."

With that, she took the initiative to hold his hand and went to the service desk to get their specially ordered ski equipment.

The four of them got dressed, carrying their skis to the ski field.

Alice said as she walked, "Ms. Carter, do you know how to ski?"

Victoria shook her head.

She had made up the skiing plan on the spot, she had seen an advertisement for the ski field while sitting in the car, so she came up with the idea.

"It's okay, Victoria, I'll teach you." Samuel chimed in at the right time, "I used to be on the school ski team."

William snorted, giving Samuel a sidelong glance, and said in a hostile tone, "Mr. Brown, you seem to be good at everything. How about a competition later?"

###chapter 84 Then Does She Like You?

Samuel raised an eyebrow and smiled faintly, "Mr. Scott, if you're that keen on our skiing race, I'll gladly take you on. But first, let me teach Victoria some basic skills, otherwise, she would be so bored just watching us play."

After saying that, he gently winked at Victoria.

Seeing the two men at odds, Victoria suddenly felt a headache coming on.

Alice heard this, a shadow flickered in her eyes, and then she looked at William with a sweet smile and said coquettishly, "You still act like a child!"

A slight smile showed on William's lips, but he said nothing.

He glanced at Victoria again, then withdrew his gaze and said to Samuel, "Mr. Brown, how about we race on the professional ski slope in an hour?"

"Sure."

Victoria looked at the two men, each unwilling to back down, and sighed inwardly.

She had long experienced William's domineering and arrogant nature, but she didn't expect him to even hold a grudge against Samuel.

Alice pulled William towards the advanced ski slope.

The advanced ski slope was very steep, usually with a gradient of over 20-30 degrees.

Such a steep slope allowed skiers to reach very high speeds, which was a great test of their skills and courage.

Alice's skiing skills were good, and William's were even better. He led Alice down the steep slope effortlessly, as if it were flat ground.

Alice followed behind him, her beautiful and charming eyes filled with deep admiration.

But thinking of the annoying Victoria, her heart sank to the bottom.

She must find a way to make Victoria completely cut ties with William!

She lowered her eyes to hide the malice in them and sped up to catch up with William.

Victoria stared at them for a long time until Samuel pulled her towards the beginner's area, and she came back to her senses and followed him.

Samuel was wearing a black professional ski suit today, his tall and upright figure looking even more handsome in it.

His hair was slightly tousled by the wind, adding a bit of casualness. His gaze at Victoria was deep and warm.

He bent down slightly, carefully checking Victoria's ski bindings, and said softly, "Victoria, don't be nervous, skiing is actually very fun. First, we need to keep our balance, with our knees slightly bent."

As he spoke, he gently adjusted Victoria's posture with his hands, making her center of gravity more stable.

Victoria listened attentively to Samuel's explanation of skiing knowledge. Although she was initially nervous and stiff, afraid to take a step, she gradually relaxed and learned how to maintain her balance under Samuel's guidance.

Samuel patted her head appreciatively, "Great job! You've already got the hang of it."

Victoria shyly smiled and stood obediently by his side.

Samuel continued to patiently teach Victoria, "Now let's learn to turn. When turning, lean your body slightly in the direction of the turn, but not too much."

As he spoke, he demonstrated.

Samuel held her hand and led her down the slope.

Under Samuel's guidance, Victoria became more proficient and began to try skiing down a small slope on her own.

Samuel followed closely behind, ready to protect her at any moment.

Suddenly, Victoria lost her footing and fell forward.

Samuel was prepared and quickly caught Victoria in his arms.

Victoria stiffened for a moment but soon relaxed, letting him hold her.

Samuel looked down at Victoria in his arms, his gaze deep and tender.

Feeling uncomfortable under his gaze, Victoria struggled slightly, "Let... let go of me."

Samuel steadied her and smiled, "Alright."

After standing firm, Victoria suddenly felt a chill and looked up to see William had returned at some point, staring at her and Samuel with a cold gaze.

Victoria instinctively looked away, avoiding his gaze, and hurriedly left with a sense of panic.

William narrowed his eyes, a dangerous glint flashing in them.

Samuel also saw William and smirked before shouting, "Mr. Scott, is it time?"

William nodded coldly and pointed to the professional ski slope, "Please, Mr. Brown."

With that, William entered the professional ski slope first, followed by Samuel.

This was the most challenging ski slope, with a very steep gradient, usually around 30-40 degrees.

The terrain was also very complex, with possible cliffs, boulders, and forests, requiring extremely high skiing skills and experience.

Victoria stared at them, hesitating whether to follow and watch.

Alice came over, smiling as she took Victoria's arm, "Ms. Carter, let's go over there and take a look."

Victoria hesitated for a moment but ultimately chose to follow Alice into the professional ski slope.

Samuel and William stood at the highest point, both handsome men attracting the attention of everyone on the ski field.

William coldly glanced at Victoria watching from a distance, his thin lips curling into a mocking smile before turning his gaze to Samuel and asking coldly, "Do you like her?"

As his words fell, Samuel's smile froze for a second, then he admitted without hesitation, "Yes."

"She doesn't like you."

"I know."

William frowned, "If you know, why are you still so stubborn?"

Samuel laughed, glancing at Victoria below, "Just because she doesn't like me now doesn't mean she won't in the future."

William sneered, "I advise you to give up early, she will never fall for you."

Unfazed by his provocation, Samuel replied, "She doesn't like me? Does she like you? Like you for bullying her to get back at her father?"

A flicker of panic crossed William's eyes. How did he know he was avenging Alvin?

He glared at Samuel, his voice harsh, "Samuel, I warn you, if you dare to talk nonsense in front of Victoria, don't blame me for being rude."

Samuel sneered, "What, angry out of shame? I'm just telling the truth. Someone like you doesn't deserve happiness. But don't worry, I never stoop to such low tactics to defeat my opponents. I will make Victoria genuinely fall in love with me."

Samuel finished and provocatively smiled at William, "Shall we start, Mr. Scott?"

"Fine," William said coldly.

Then, the two men leaped high and jumped onto the ski slope.

Both performed high-difficulty moves, stunning the crowd and drawing applause and cheers.

William took the lead, leaning forward, pushing off with his legs, and his skis gliding swiftly over the snow, kicking up a spray of snow.

He skillfully controlled his direction, navigating the steep slope as if it were flat ground, quickly weaving through the gates.

Samuel was not to be outdone, using his superb skills and excellent balance to closely follow William.

###chapter 85 He Was Going Crazy

At a sharp turn, Samuel showcased his exceptional skills.

He leaned his body inward, his skis cutting precisely into the snow, completing the turn at an incredible speed.

William was equally impressive, adjusting his balance to navigate the turn in a more stable manner.

Victoria clenched her hands nervously, silently cheering for Samuel's brilliant performance while also worrying for William.

Having known William for so long, she never realized he was so good at skiing.

Alice glanced at the two skiing men, then at the nervous Victoria, revealing a venomous smile.

She hadn't expected William to compete with Samuel for Victoria.

It seemed she had underestimated Victoria's place in his heart.

But fortunately, not only had Victoria not noticed, but William himself hadn't realized his attention towards Victoria, thinking he just wanted to get back at her.

Alice clenched her fists tightly, her eyes flashing with malicious calculation.

The surrounding spectators were also captivated by the exciting race, exclaiming in amazement.

As the race progressed, the two men's speed increased, and the competition grew fiercer.

They sped down the slope, their figures like two streaks of lightning.

William constantly sought opportunities to overtake Samuel, while Samuel remained vigilant, giving William no chance.

On the final straight, William decided to sprint with all his might.

He pushed hard with his legs, increasing his speed, his ski poles moving rapidly on the snow.

Samuel also felt the pressure, accelerating to maintain his lead.

Victoria's eyes were fixed on the finish line, her nerves at their peak.

She didn't know whether she wanted Samuel or William to win.

The surrounding spectators held their breath, eagerly awaiting the final result.

In the end, Samuel crossed the finish line first by a narrow margin.

He stopped his skis, removed his goggles, and panted heavily, sweat beading on his forehead.

William followed closely behind, crossing the finish line.

He took off his skis, threw his goggles on the ground, and walked away without looking at Victoria.

Alice stepped forward, picked up William's discarded items, and quickly followed him.

She then turned to Victoria and Samuel with a smile and said, "Ms. Carter, Mr. Brown, if you don't mind, we're heading to the hotel at the ski resort to rest. I've already booked the rooms, just give your names when you arrive. See you tonight!"

Victoria softly agreed, watching them leave.

Once they were out of sight, Victoria finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Samuel removed his gear, walked up to Victoria, and asked with a smile, "How was it? Not bad, right?"

Victoria nodded, genuinely praising, "Very impressive."

Hearing Victoria's words, Samuel couldn't help but smile and said softly, "Actually, I have even better skills in the bedroom."

His voice was so low that Victoria didn't hear clearly and asked, "What did you say?"

"Nothing, let's go, I'll take you to try other activities."

"Okay," Victoria nodded.

William stormed back to the luxurious hotel suite, immediately grabbed the water cup on the table, and drank it all.

He felt a burning rage in his chest, wanting to tear Samuel apart.

He never thought he would do something so childish and ridiculous, competing with someone over a woman.

And he lost!

He felt like he was going crazy!

Alice followed him into the room, seeing William's furious expression, her hatred for Victoria growing stronger.

However, she controlled her emotions, smiling as she approached to comfort William, "William, don't be angry, let me help you cool down, okay?"

As she spoke, she reached out to touch William's neck.

Her fingers were cold, touching William's skin, making him feel a tingling sensation.

This feeling made him a bit dazed.

But he quickly regained his composure, grabbing Alice's mischievous hand and sternly scolding, "Who taught you these things?"

Alice was taken aback, pouting in grievance, "William, I..."

Seeing her pitiful look, William softened and said gently, "Be good, don't learn these things, you don't need to."

Alice dug her nails into her palm, suppressing her anger, and squeezed out a tear.

"William, do you despise me because of the past?"

William was stunned, his tone softening, "No, how could you think that?"

Alice raised her red-rimmed eyes, "Then why?"

"Alice, you know, I want to wait until we get married..."

Before William could finish, Alice suddenly hugged him, crying, "William, please, don't hate me. I'm really afraid of losing you."

"Silly girl, how could I?" William patted her back, comforting her gently.

Alice buried her head in his chest, a cold smile on her lips.

Her heart was filled with hatred, and she vowed to repay today's humiliation to Victoria a hundredfold.

Under Samuel's guidance, Victoria practiced a few more laps, gradually getting the hang of skiing and no longer as clumsy as before.

When she took off her skis, she found her ankles aching badly, almost unable to stand.

"What's wrong? Are you in pain?" Samuel quickly supported her, frowning with concern.

"It's nothing, just a bit sore," Victoria shook her head.

"Wait here for a moment," Samuel said, helping her to sit down.

He took their gear to the storage area and then returned.

He knelt beside Victoria, checking her injury.

Victoria wanted to refuse, but her right foot hurt so much that she went along with Samuel's actions.

Samuel removed her shoe, carefully examining her ankle.

"Fortunately, it's not a sprain."

Samuel helped her put her shoe back on, then scooped her up in his arms.

Victoria cried out in surprise, "Samuel!"

Samuel smiled and explained, "I'm carrying you back to the hotel to rest."

Victoria struggled to get down, but Samuel insisted, "Don't worry, I'm just taking you there, I won't take advantage of you."

Victoria initially wanted to resist, but then she thought about the terrifying Alice at the hotel. Being close to Samuel might ease Alice's hostility towards her.

With this in mind, she stopped struggling.

"Thank you," Victoria said softly.

Samuel smiled and said nothing more, carrying Victoria back to the hotel.

William and Alice were chatting in the lobby, waiting for them to return for dinner, and saw Samuel and Victoria's intimate behavior.

###chapter 86 You Will Be Happy for Her, Right?

Especially William, his face was extremely gloomy, exuding a cold aura.

Alice watched this scene, her eyes showing a glimmer of calculation.

She tugged on William's sleeve and whispered, "William, Mr. Brown is Victoria's boyfriend. If you make too much trouble with him, Ms. Carter will be unhappy."

Upon hearing this, a trace of ruthlessness flashed in William's deep eyes but quickly disappeared.

Victoria also saw William and Alice, especially noticing his gaze, which made her feel instantly stiff.

Sensing her discomfort, Samuel patted her shoulder with a smile and whispered, "Don't be afraid, I'm here. He won't eat you."

The small joke brought a light blush to Victoria's cheeks, making her feel much more relaxed.

William's eyes flashed with cold light as Alice took his arm and led him towards Victoria.

"Ms. Carter, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?" Alice feigned concern.

Victoria shook her head and forced a smile, "I'm fine, just a bit sore in my feet."

William glanced at her feet and sneered, "You're always getting sick or injured; it's surprising how fragile you are, given your ordinary status!"

Victoria pressed her lips together, not answering him, but her face turned much paler.

Alice looked at Victoria and pretended to help, "William, why do you always pick on Ms. Carter?"

"I'm just telling the truth. She's not like you, a real lady of high status," William said with a mocking glance at Victoria.

Victoria lowered her eyes, not refuting his sarcasm.

But her slightly trembling hands betrayed her thoughts.

William, what right do you have to belittle me like this! What right!

Samuel noticed her distress and subtly held her tighter, coldly looking at William, "Mr. Scott, everyone is equal. Please watch your words!"

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Brown, don't mind him. Our William speaks harshly but has a kind heart. How's your foot? Do you need to go to the hospital?" Alice asked with concern.

Victoria shook her head and replied softly, "No need, I'll rest for a bit, and it'll be fine later."

"In that case, I'll take you back to your room to rest and apply some medicine," Samuel suggested considerately.

Victoria hesitated for a moment and then nodded lightly.

William's face instantly darkened even more.

Alice smiled brightly, "Then I'll trouble Mr. Brown to take good care of her. I booked a couple's suite for you two, you'll love it."

"A couple's suite?" Victoria exclaimed.

William couldn't hold back, "They're not even married! Book another room!"

Alice pouted, "William, you're being unreasonable. What era is this? What's wrong with couples living together?"

William was about to say something when Samuel spoke, "Victoria, don't worry, I'll sleep on the couch tonight and take care of you."

Victoria wanted to say something, but Alice looked at her with deep eyes, "Ms. Carter, do you have a problem with that?"

Victoria bit her lip and remained silent.

William's face became even more unpleasant.

Alice smiled sweetly, "Alright then, it's decided. Mr. Brown, I'll have someone bring the medicine box and dinner to your room later."

With that, she pulled William out of the hall.

William remained silent, his face exceptionally cold.

Alice clung to his arm, pretending to be gentle as she leaned against his chest, looking like a delicate bird.

She looked up at him and softly said, "William, Ms. Carter has found her happiness, you should be happy for her, right?"

Her voice was gentle, but her tone carried a hint of probing.

William's eyes deepened upon hearing her voice, but he didn't answer.

Seeing this, Alice's lips curled into a smile, "Let's go back to our room."

The room was warm, and Samuel gently placed Victoria on the couch, took off her coat, and poured a cup of hot water, handing it to her.

After drinking a cup of water, Victoria felt much better.

She was about to get up from the couch but was pressed back by Samuel.

"Victoria, you sit here, I'll apply the medicine for you," he said, then turned and went into the bedroom.

A moment later, Samuel returned with a medicine box and a basin of hot water.

He bent down, half-kneeling in front of the couch, carefully taking off Victoria's shoes and socks to wash her feet.

"Samuel, I can do it myself," Victoria said, feeling a bit embarrassed.

Samuel looked up and smiled at her, "I want to be your most loyal knight."

Hearing his joke, Victoria couldn't help but laugh.

Seeing her smile, Samuel's eyes flashed, and he playfully tapped her nose, "Silly girl, you're smiling so sweetly."

Victoria blushed and avoided his hand, lowering her head, not daring to look at him.

Seeing her shy demeanor, Samuel's lips curved into a gentle smile.

Victoria's skin was smooth, her feet delicate and tender, her toes round and full, looking particularly enticing.

Samuel's throat moved slightly, his eyes filled with desire, and his fingers holding the towel turned a bit red.

He cleared his throat, trying to suppress the surge of desire within him, and soaked the towel in hot water, carefully rubbing Victoria's small feet.

His movements were extremely gentle, and Victoria's body gradually tensed.

Although they didn't exchange any words, Victoria could feel his careful care.

Victoria slightly turned her head, looking at the half-kneeling Samuel, his handsome features appearing even more charming under the warm yellow light.

Samuel noticed her gaze, stopped his actions, and turned his head, meeting her eyes.

Victoria quickly looked away, not daring to meet his gaze.

Samuel smiled and wrung out the towel, "All done."

He stood up, took the ointment, and gestured for her to extend her foot.

Victoria hesitated for a few seconds, then extended her foot towards Samuel, letting him carefully apply the ointment.

His long fingers skillfully applied the ointment to her skin, each touch sending a current through her body.

Victoria's body stiffened, not daring to move.

Samuel looked up at Victoria, "Does it hurt?"

Victoria quickly shook her head, "N-no."

Samuel looked at her slightly flushed cheeks and her sexy figure revealed after taking off her heavy coat, his throat burning, and an uncontrollable thought surged in his mind.

Victoria noticed his intense gaze, her heart pounding, and even her ears turned red.

Samuel felt a tingling sensation in his heart, which quickly became uncontrollable.

He raised his head and slowly leaned towards Victoria.

###chapter 87 Victoria, I Want You

The two were very close, so close that their breaths intertwined, and they could clearly hear each other's panting.

Victoria's heart was pounding, as if it was about to leap out of her chest.

Samuel's eyes were filled with intense aggression.

She had never seen him like this before.

Should she accept or refuse?

Victoria closed her eyes, blocking out all distractions, not daring to open them.

Suddenly, there was a rapid knock on the door.

A trace of annoyance flashed across Samuel's brow. He cursed under his breath and got up to open the door.

When the door opened, there was a waiter standing outside with a dining cart.

The waiter glanced inside the room and politely nodded to the two of them, "Hello, your dinner is ready. Please enjoy."

Samuel nodded, stepped aside, and let the waiter in.

When he returned to the room, Victoria had already regained her composure.

Samuel sighed, feeling a bit regretful but also somewhat pleased that Victoria hadn't resisted.

He moved the food from the dining cart to the table and handed a bowl of soup to Victoria.

"Have something to eat first. You've had a long day," he said, his eyes filled with concern.

Victoria didn't refuse and obediently took the bowl of soup, lowering her head to drink it.

Samuel also sat beside her, acting as if nothing had happened.

After dinner, Victoria excused herself to the bathroom to escape the awkward situation.

She leaned on the sink, staring at her reflection in the mirror. Her cheeks were still red, like ripe apples, incredibly enticing.

She touched her slightly warm face, took a deep breath, and forced herself to calm down.

When Victoria came out of the bathroom, she found Samuel sitting on the sofa, drawing with the hotel's pencil and paper.

With a few strokes, he had sketched Victoria's smiling face while skiing, like a Winterberry blooming in winter.

Victoria stared at the sketch, suddenly remembering the oil painting Samuel had given her before. It depicted her just as vividly and happily, like flowers blooming in spring.

Victoria bit her lip and walked over to the sofa, looking down at Samuel.

He glanced up at Victoria, then continued to focus on his drawing.

Victoria gazed at his serious profile, her eyes suddenly welling up with tears.

During this time, Samuel had been so good to her that it made her feel like she was worthy of being loved!

"Why are you crying?" Samuel put down the pencil and looked up at Victoria. "Is the drawing not good?"

Samuel's voice was low and gentle, like the warm and comfortable sunshine in March.

Victoria quickly blinked away her tears, forced a smile, and said, "It's beautiful."

Samuel smiled, reached out his hand, and brushed her bangs away from her forehead, revealing her smooth and full forehead.

Victoria stared blankly at his face, feeling a flutter in her heart.

Suddenly, she thought of William.

If only he could be this gentle.

Samuel seemed to sense Victoria's distraction, a hint of sadness flashed in his eyes, but it quickly disappeared.

He playfully pinched Victoria's delicate nose and said indulgently, "Don't overthink it. You've had a long day. Get some sleep."

"What about you?" Victoria asked hesitantly.

"I'll sleep later," Samuel said, taking a blanket and pillow to the sofa and smiling at Victoria.

Hearing this, Victoria sighed in relief, lay down on the bed, and closed her eyes.

Samuel looked at Victoria on the bed, his eyes dark and unreadable. After a long while, he took a bathrobe and headed to the bathroom.

Victoria suddenly felt unbearably hot in her sleep, as if a fire was burning inside her.

She woke up abruptly, her cheeks flushed, her whole body tender and alluring.

What was going on? Why was she feeling like this?

"Victoria!" Samuel stood at the door, his voice hoarse.

Victoria hurriedly pulled the blanket over herself, her voice trembling, "W-what's wrong?"

"Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?"

Victoria bit her lip, trying to steady her emotions, "You, you rest first. I'm fine."

"I know you're feeling bad right now. Our food might have been drugged," Samuel explained.

"What should we do?" Victoria panicked, clutching her chest, feeling increasingly unbearable.

She didn't need to guess who did this.

Alice was determined to make her stay away from William.

"Can I come in?"

"No, no!" Victoria responded softly, her voice trembling uncontrollably.

Samuel paused at the door for a moment, but in the end, his rationality couldn't overcome his desire. He pushed the door open and walked in.

Seeing his figure, Victoria blushed even more.

She clasped her legs together, her fists pressed against her knees, her eyes wandering, looking pitiful.

Samuel looked at her, feeling parched.

Victoria bit her lip, feeling her sanity slipping away, a deep desire welling up inside her.

"Let me help you," Samuel said, stepping forward, holding Victoria's cold hand, and pulling her into his arms.

Victoria struggled a few times but ultimately couldn't resist her body's instincts.

Samuel held Victoria tightly, kissing her red lips, prying open her teeth to taste her sweetness, savoring the flavor in her mouth.

Gradually, Samuel's breathing became heavy.

His large hand climbed up Victoria's slender waist.

Victoria let out a soft moan, collapsing into Samuel's arms.

Samuel's long-suppressed desire exploded in an instant, pressing Victoria onto the bed.

"Victoria, I want you," his voice was low, his eyes red.

Victoria, tormented by the drug, was groggy, unable to respond to Samuel's words.

"Victoria, I like you, really like you, more than William," Samuel whispered in her ear, his voice hoarse.

His fingers roamed over Victoria's delicate skin, each touch making her body tremble slightly.

"I know I shouldn't take advantage of you, but I can't control myself. Victoria, please, let me be your man. I'll treat you well, for the rest of my life."

In her daze, Victoria heard Samuel's words, but she couldn't comprehend them.

Samuel leaned down, kissing Victoria's forehead, cheeks, and neck.

Victoria's body writhed, overwhelmed by the surging desire inside her, her head buzzing.

She grabbed Samuel's collar, tilting her small chin, and kissed his lips.

Victoria's initiative thrilled Samuel.

Her actions were like a powerful catalyst for Samuel.

He flipped Victoria over, pinning her beneath him, kissing her passionately.

When her sexy body was exposed to the air, Victoria finally regained a bit of consciousness.

She screamed, using all her strength to push Samuel away, rolling to the side and curling up.

Samuel was hurt by Victoria's resolute attitude, feeling heartbroken.

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you," he said, looking at her apologetically.

Victoria's mind was foggy, knowing she couldn't stay here any longer, or the consequences would be unimaginable.

She struggled to get up from the floor, hastily put on her coat, and rushed out of the room.

Samuel watched Victoria's panicked escape, his heart aching as if it was about to break.

Samuel slowly crouched down, holding his head in his hands, in deep pain.

###chapter 88 What Did You Do to Me?

William watched helplessly as Samuel took Victoria into the room. He could even foresee what was about to happen next.

But he couldn't do anything because Alice's intense gaze was always on him.

Previously, to teach Victoria a lesson, she had even used drugs on herself.

If he showed more concern for Victoria, Alice might go even crazier.

"William, these are your favorite oysters."

Alice smiled as she placed a dish in front of William, then handed him the utensils, her smile gentle and charming.

William picked up the utensils, absentmindedly tasted the dish, and then put it down again.

"William, you seem a bit distracted today. Is it because of Ms. Carter?" Alice asked casually, but her words carried a chilling undertone.

William frowned slightly and retorted indifferently, "Why would I think about her? It's just some issues at the company, making me a bit irritable."

Alice pursed her lips, her eyes flickering with thoughts.

"Is that so? Then I might have misunderstood you!" Alice smiled lightly, "Let's go to bed early tonight and leave bright and early tomorrow."

William didn't respond.

After dinner, Alice took a towel and went to the bathroom to take a shower.

When she came out, she slowly dried her wet long hair with a towel.

She was wearing a loose, sexy nightgown, her full, voluptuous breasts clearly visible, and her long legs were so enticing that they could make any man's blood heat up.

Alice glanced at William sitting in a daze on the chair, and smiled.

William was staring at the TV screen, not looking away.

Alice walked over to William, hugged his neck from behind, and said coquettishly, "William, help me dry my hair."

She leaned closer to him, her warm, moist breath spraying on William's neck.

William closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

"Okay," he said in a low, hoarse voice.

Alice smiled with satisfaction, stood on tiptoe, and kissed his cheek, "William, you're so good."

William forced a stiff smile.

He got up from the sofa, picked up the hairdryer from the table, and seriously started drying Alice's hair.

Alice leaned quietly against William, enjoying him drying her hair, a smile on her lips.

Once Victoria disappeared from their world, no one would be able to compete with her.

Alice looked up at William in the mirror, his features handsome and well-defined.

Especially the way he was seriously drying her hair at the moment made her heart race, and she felt her whole heart was on fire.

Alice grabbed his hand, slowly moving it down her face, landing on her full, round chest, her fingers gently stroking.

William's hand paused for a moment, he turned to look at her, a dark look in his eyes.

Alice gently unbuttoned her nightgown, her breasts faintly visible, she bit her pink lips, her seductive posture making William's throat tighten.

Alice's nightgown slid to the ground, and her hands hooked around William's neck.

She leaned in, gently sucking on his thin lips, entangling passionately.

William groaned, feeling a burning sensation in his lower abdomen.

"Alice," William called her name hoarsely.

Alice looked up at him, her eyes seductive, seemingly expecting something.

She parted her red lips, softly saying, "William, make love to me."

William felt his body burning up, his head dizzy.

The remaining rationality told him something was wrong with his body.

Even after being with Victoria so many times, he had never felt such a strong urge.

Seeing his hesitation, Alice panicked, quickly grabbing William's wrist, continuing, "Don't just stand there, hurry up!"

"Alice, what did you do to me?" William suddenly grabbed Alice's shoulders, questioning her.

Alice's face turned pale, looking at William in disbelief.

How could he suddenly suspect her?

"What are you talking about, William? I don't understand." Alice shook William's arm, saying aggrievedly.

"Stop pretending!" William's emotions became more agitated.

Then, as if remembering something, he suddenly stood up, shook off Alice's grip, and left the room in big strides.

Alice fell to the floor in a daze, watching William's figure getting further away, her face filled with intense killing intent.

'Damn! Victoria! This is all your fault, all because of you!' she fumed inwardly.

William stumbled out of the room, heading towards Victoria's room.

If Alice drugged him, she might have drugged Victoria too.

He couldn't let Samuel touch her!

William staggered to Victoria's floor, just in time to see Victoria rushing out of the room in a disheveled state.

He didn't have time to call her before she disappeared around the corner, and he hurriedly chased after her.

Victoria's mind was already muddled, she was running towards the hotel entrance on instinct.

Suddenly, a familiar masculine scent hit her nose.

Her body instantly softened, leaning against his strong chest, crying helplessly.

William held her, softly comforting, "Victoria, don't cry."

She looked up at him, her dazed appearance making William's heart ache.

"William!" Victoria threw herself into his arms, tears streaming down her face.

He held her tightly, soothing her gently, "It's okay, don't cry, Victoria. It's my fault, I didn't protect you."

Victoria lay on his shoulder, sobbing.

William picked her up and walked towards the campsite next to the hotel.

The tents here were more like small cabins, surrounded by snow-covered pine trees, looking very beautiful.

Victoria lay on the mat, her misty eyes half-closed, her long hair scattered on the pillow.

"William!" she murmured, her voice soft and tender.

William leaned down to her ear, intimately licking her ear.

Victoria shyly squirmed, her body involuntarily curling up like a shrimp.

William's eyes darkened, his hand reaching into her clothes, kneading her soft skin.

"William!" Victoria panted, her cheeks flushed, she grabbed William's hand tightly, looking at him with pleading eyes.

William knew what she wanted, and he wanted it too.

But without proper lubrication, she could get hurt.

"Be good, Victoria!" William patiently coaxed her, "Or you'll get hurt."

###chapter 89 Baby, Do You Like It?

Victoria hesitated for a moment before weakly nodding in agreement.

William finally breathed a sigh of relief. He pushed Victoria down onto the bed, skillfully removing all her clothes.

Her sexy body was displayed in front of him, causing him to swallow hard and feel an unbearable ache in his lower body.

Victoria moaned softly, her petite breasts standing erect in the air, trembling with her movements.

William buried his face in her neck, his heavy breathing spraying onto her sensitive skin, causing an unusual tickling sensation.

His hands roamed over her body, leaving traces behind.

She couldn't help but twist her waist, matching his rhythm, moaning out loud.

His lips sucked on her collarbone, occasionally nibbling, leaving intimate marks.

Victoria moaned in discomfort, her body's reactions faster than her brain. Her hands grabbed his clothes, almost wanting to tear them apart.

William slowly moved his hand down her slender waist, caressing her flat, soft belly, and continued to slide down.

When he touched a wet spot, Victoria suddenly opened her hazy eyes, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush.

She stretched out her legs, hooking them around William's waist, pressing her body closer.

"William!" she gently stroked William's chest.

"Good girl, relax," William coaxed her, his hand slowly moving to her private area, his fingers teasing.

Victoria's small mouth let out an extremely enticing low moan, her body becoming increasingly wet with desire, as if about to be overwhelmed by her own arousal.

She closed her eyes, enjoying William's caresses.

William's kisses slowly landed on her lips, his tongue skillfully slipping into her mouth.

Victoria was aroused to the extreme, hugging William's back, tilting her neck, enduring his demands and invasions.

William's large hand grasped her breast, while the other hand held her slender waist.

He gently lifted her legs, sliding his penis between her thighs.

Victoria's hands clung to his broad, firm shoulders, her legs tightening around his waist.

She felt William's penis rubbing between her legs, and she couldn't help but moan out loud.

William pressed his forehead against hers, his voice hoarse and sexy, "Baby, do you like it?"

Victoria murmured softly, her body completely paralyzed.

William could no longer suppress his desire. He flipped Victoria over, forcing her to straddle his waist.

Their hot bodies intertwined, rubbing against each other.

William lifted her hips, thrusting his body inside, taking her fiercely.

Victoria couldn't help but cry out.

William smiled in satisfaction, his large hand gently kneading her soft buttocks.

Each of his thrusts precisely hit Victoria's sensitive spots, making her shiver all over, her body tense, and her throat letting out pleasurable moans.

Listening to her soul-stirring moans, William felt his blood boiling.

He pounded into her wildly, as if he wanted to devour her completely.

Victoria clung to him tightly, letting his rhythm wash over every part of her body.

Their naked bodies tangled together, sweat dripping onto each other.

Just as they were immersed in the moment, a familiar voice called out from outside.

"Victoria! Where did you go? Come back!" Samuel's voice came from not far away.

He had taken a cold shower to calm down a bit.

Although he was a bit hurt by Victoria's escape, he was more worried about her safety at the moment.

It was freezing cold on the mountain, and she was dressed so thinly, without her phone.

What if something happened to her?

"William, let me down!" Victoria urged him, her voice anxious, afraid that Samuel would discover them in this state.

"Don't move!" William ordered fiercely.

Victoria didn't dare to disobey him, staying still and even breathing carefully.

Samuel quickly arrived at their door, and Victoria could see Samuel's figure through the gap in the window.

Seeing how much Victoria cared about Samuel's feelings, William felt a surge of jealousy, thrusting his hips heavily.

Victoria couldn't help but let out a muffled groan.

Samuel heard Victoria's voice and hesitated, standing in front of the tent with a frown.

"Victoria! Are you in there?" Samuel called out loudly.

"Samuel, you should go back!" Victoria suppressed her voice, trying to sound calm and not let Samuel notice anything unusual.

"Victoria!" Samuel's tone carried a hint of urgency and worry. He continued to ask, "Victoria, are you okay?"

William's large hand gripped Victoria's slender waist, not allowing her to be distracted.

Victoria gritted her teeth, shaking her head, and forced herself to say calmly, "I'm fine, I'll sleep here tonight."

"Are you really okay? You sounded a bit off just now." Samuel was skeptical.

William maliciously pinched Victoria's breast, causing her to panic. She quickly explained, "I-I'm really fine!"

Samuel furrowed his brows, saying with concern, "Victoria, if you're not feeling well, don't push yourself. Tell me, and I'll take you to the hospital for a check-up."

The more William listened, the angrier he became. He decided not to hold back anymore and thrust deeply into Victoria.

Victoria cried out in surprise, instinctively hugging William's back.

"Victoria, what's wrong?" Samuel asked nervously.

"N-nothing," Victoria's face turned red, stammering, "Just a bug. You should go back, I need to rest."

Samuel seemed to sense something. He paused for a few seconds, then said nothing more and turned to leave.

Samuel's footsteps gradually faded away. Confirming he had completely left, William finally withdrew from Victoria's body.

Victoria lay on the edge of the bed, panting heavily, drenched in sweat.

William's fluids still lingered inside her, warm and burning.

Her eyes were misty, making William react again.

William's large hand covered her small hand, guiding it to his penis.

Victoria gasped in fright, struggling to pull her hand back, "No!"

William let out a low, hoarse laugh.

Victoria glared at him with wide eyes, angrily saying, "You... let go of my hand."

William laughed wickedly, his large hand wrapping around her slender fingers, slowly pressing.

Victoria's body trembled uncontrollably, the stimulation too intense, almost driving her crazy.

"Victoria!" William leaned down, sucking on Victoria's nipple, gently licking.

Victoria was tormented by him, feeling an increasing emptiness in her just-satisfied body.

###chapter 90 A Maid to Satisfy His Desires

William caught sight of her excitement swelling once more and couldn't resist leaning in for another passionate encounter.

It wasn't until Victoria was utterly spent that William finally released her.

Victoria fell into a deep sleep. William helped her tidy up her disheveled long hair and wiped her body with a warm towel.

Then he held her and fell asleep peacefully.

When she woke up, it was already morning. The morning light shone into the room, filling it with brightness.

Victoria turned her head to look at William. His handsome profile came into her view, and she couldn't help but reach out to touch his well-defined brows, high nose, and sexy thin lips.

Victoria slowly leaned in and gently kissed the corner of William's lips.

William suddenly opened his deep eyes and met Victoria's clear and bright pupils.

Victoria was stunned.

"Morning!" she greeted plainly.

"Morning!" William lazily squinted his eyes, his long index finger lightly touching her rosy lips, his voice magnetic and seductive.

"I'm hungry again!" William suddenly said.

His deep, husky voice made her cheeks flush. She knew what kind of hunger he was talking about.

This man was too greedy, never getting enough.

Just as Victoria was lost in thought, there was a knock on the door.

"William, didn't you say there was something at the company? We should go." Alice's gentle voice sounded at the door.

Victoria's originally flushed cheeks instantly turned pale.

What if Alice knew she had been with William again? Thinking of the police station's interrogation lights and cold handcuffs, Victoria couldn't help but shiver.

William also frowned, got up, and started getting dressed, replying, "Wait a moment, I'll be right out."

Victoria hurriedly started getting dressed too, but she was so weak that her movements were slow.

William glanced at her, said nothing, and closed the door as he stepped out.

Alice acted as if nothing had happened, smiling and saying, "William, I bought you breakfast. Eat it while it's hot."

"Okay," William said indifferently, glancing at the bag in Alice's hand. "Let's go back to the hotel to eat. It's cold here."

He said this while pulling her arm to leave.

Alice smiled and held him back, "Why are you in such a hurry to leave, William? We haven't finished our business."

William's face darkened, and he said sternly, "What else do you want to do?"

His tone was heavy, but Alice wasn't angry at all. She placed the bag in his hand and turned to open the door again.

Victoria happened to be coming out of the room, and their eyes met. Victoria couldn't help but gasp.

Alice had a smile on her lips, while Victoria stood stiffly, at a loss.

Alice's eyes swept over Victoria's messy hair and her body that was covered in kiss marks, her gaze deep.

"Ms. Garcia, don't misunderstand. Last night I..."

Victoria tried to explain, but Alice waved her hand to interrupt.

"It's okay, it was just an accident. William knows I'm weak and didn't want to hurt me, so he came to you for relief. In families like ours, having a few maids to satisfy his desires is quite common!"

Victoria's face instantly turned pale. She stared at Alice in shock, unable to speak.

This sentence was undoubtedly a disguised way of calling her a prostitute.

"Ms. Garcia, you!" Victoria was so angry she couldn't speak.

"Ms. Carter, don't be mad. I won't let you suffer a loss." Alice said as she took out a check from her pocket and handed it to Victoria. "After all, you're not a maid of the Scott family. Here's $100,000 as compensation."

Victoria was so angry that her body trembled. She looked at William, only to find that he was indifferent, letting Alice humiliate her.

Seeing that she was reluctant to take the check, Alice smiled and urged, "What's wrong? Ms. Carter, do you think it's not enough?"

She deliberately dragged out her words, her eyes full of provocation.

"No, it's not necessary." Victoria lowered her head, her hands clenched into fists, her eyes stinging with tears.

William saw Victoria's aggrieved look and felt a slight pang in his heart. But seeing Alice's expression, he knew that if he defended Victoria now, Alice would go even crazier.

Thinking of the medical report the doctor had given him earlier, William's expression turned gloomy. He looked up at Victoria and said, "Since Alice gave it to you, take it."

Victoria was shocked and looked up at William.

She thought William would at least argue for her, but he was helping Alice humiliate her.

At this moment, Victoria felt a suffocating pain in her chest, a wave of dizziness, and she almost fell.

William's eyes flashed with a trace of reluctance, but he quickly turned away.

Alice smiled smugly and said, "Ms. Carter, I remember your mother's medical bills were paid by William. You accepted his money, so why not mine?"

She finished speaking and stuffed the check into Victoria's hand, then turned to William and said coquettishly, "William, let's go!"

William glanced at Victoria's pale face and said nothing.

The two left together.

Watching them leave, Victoria squatted down and cried.

This scene was seen by someone in the corner.

He clenched his fists, wanting to comfort her, but his feet felt like they were filled with lead and couldn't move.

Finally, he sighed helplessly and turned to leave.

Victoria squatted on the ground and cried for a long time. Finally, she stood up and smiled bitterly.

"Fool, what are you expecting? Hasn't he always treated you this way?

'In his eyes, haven't you always been a toy for his sexual needs? How pathetic!"

With that, Victoria bitterly smiled, wiped away her tears, and forced herself to return to the hotel room to pack her things and leave.

When she entered, Samuel was already gone.

Victoria didn't regret running away last night, but she still felt very sorry for him.

Victoria saw the sketch Samuel had drawn of her on the table and couldn't help but pick it up.

In the sketch, she was still smiling brightly, a stark contrast to her now red and swollen eyes from crying.

But there was an extra line of words on the sketch compared to last night's: "Victoria, are you really happy with him? No matter what, I just want you to be happy."

Victoria's heart suddenly ached, and she cried even harder, this time out of guilt. 

She sniffed and picked up her phone to call Samuel.

No one answered, so she called again, but still, no one answered.

After putting down the phone, she walked out of the hotel in a daze, only to run into William and Alice at the door.

###chapter 91 Drunkenness

She didn't dare to look up, keeping her head down as she brushed past them.

William called out to her, "Victoria, let me take you back!"

Victoria stopped in her tracks, slowly turned around, and calmly said, "No need, Mr. Scott."

After speaking, she started walking towards the cable car.

William frowned as he watched her frail figure, a hint of worry appearing between his brows. He pressed his thin lips together and finally decided to stride after her.

Alice stood there in a daze for a while, looking at his tall and upright figure, her lips curling into a mocking smile.

William grabbed Victoria's hand, "Don't be stubborn. It's so early, there are no cars at the foot of the mountain to take you back to the city!"

Victoria shook off his hand and stubbornly said, "Thank you, Mr. Scott, but there's no need to trouble you. I'll take the bus back."

William furrowed his brows, seeing her attitude, he didn't bother to argue. He let go of her hand, but when he saw her stumble a few steps and almost fall, he quickly supported her.

Her hand was cold and weak, her whole body trembling slightly.

"Victoria!"

"Mr. Scott, please leave me alone. I'm really fine. All I ask is that you and your girlfriend stay away from me. I've had enough," Victoria murmured.

Hearing her mention the word "girlfriend," William's face darkened instantly, his voice low and tinged with anger, "Victoria, do you have to be like this?"

Victoria closed her eyes, refusing to look at him, and coldly said, "Please, Mr. Scott, show some respect. We have nothing to do with each other anymore!"

After speaking, without waiting for William's reaction, she pushed him away and walked straight ahead.

She walked faster and faster, just in time to catch a cable car that was about to depart, squeezing herself in.

The cable car seat held only her.

Victoria closed her eyes and leaned back in the seat, unable to tell if she felt more sadness or anger, or perhaps both.

She took out her phone and blocked all of William's contacts.

William watched that lonely, slender figure, his heart inexplicably aching, as if someone had torn it apart.

His gaze gradually darkened, a complex emotion flashing in his eyes.

After returning from Snowflake Peak, Victoria fell ill, suffering from a severe fever and cough.

She took some medicine, insisted on going to work during the day, and went to the hospital for IV drips at night.

Wendy felt extremely sorry for her seeing her like this.

She took the initiative to accompany her to the hospital every day, taking care of her and making food for her.

Under her care, Victoria quickly recovered.

She put all the unpleasant things behind her and focused all her energy on work.

It was time to pick up a painting from Samuel's studio.

Samuel had previously agreed to send a painting to Starry Studio Gallery for consignment every month.

Diana was urging her to go and get it.

Since the trip to Snowflake Peak, the two had not contacted each other, not even a single message.

Victoria took a few deep breaths, trying to suppress the strange feeling in her heart.

Although she still felt very awkward, for the sake of work, she had to force herself to find Samuel.

She hesitated for a moment outside the studio before ringing the doorbell.

Soon, the door opened.

The person who opened the door was Ryan, whom Victoria had met once. He was wearing loose sportswear, revealing his strong, muscular waist and sexy abs.

When Ryan saw that it was Victoria at the door, his expression stiffened slightly, then returned to normal, asking, "What are you doing here?"

Victoria opened her mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

"Come in!" he said, stepping aside to let Victoria in.

"I'm looking for Samuel. Is he not here?"

Ryan's fingers twitched slightly, and he said nonchalantly, "If you're his girlfriend, I'll call him out for you. If you're not, then don't waste each other's time!"

Hearing this, Victoria's cheeks flushed, and she lowered her gaze, softly saying, "Sorry to bother you!" She then turned to leave.

Seeing that she was really leaving, Ryan quickly called out to her. After hesitating for a moment, he finally relented, "Fine, you're here to pick up a painting, right? He's prepared it for you!"

Victoria was stunned for a moment, then looked up at Ryan.

Ryan crossed his arms and nodded slightly, "Aren't you going? Do you want me to carry you there?"

Victoria's cheeks heated up, and she quickly walked a few steps forward, walking beside Ryan, heading to the third-floor storage room where the paintings were kept.

Ryan handed her the painting Samuel had prepared, his tone flat, "You can go now. Don't come looking for him again."

Hearing this, Victoria suddenly looked up, her eyes instantly welling up with tears, "Is he still mad at me?"

Ryan sneered, looking at her coldly, "How could he be mad at you? He's mad at himself."

Ryan sighed, "I've known him since we were kids. I've never seen him care so much about any girl. I've never seen him so heartbroken over anyone. You're the only one. He loves you very much, you should understand that."

Victoria bit her lip, "I'm not good enough for him! He deserves better!"

Hearing her say this, Ryan became even angrier, his tone becoming much more serious, "Whether you're good enough or not isn't for you to decide. And I believe he cherishes you more than anyone else, doesn't he? Look, what are these?"

Ryan walked to the side and pulled back the curtain covering the paintings, revealing a large pile of paintings, all of different versions of Victoria-happy, sad, shy, and so on.

All of them were of her.

"These were all painted by him," he said.

Victoria stared blankly at the paintings in front of her, a crystal tear sliding down her cheek. She raised her hand to wipe away the tear.

Ryan took a few steps closer, bent down, and took a tissue from his pocket, handing it to her, his voice gentle, "He really likes you. He said you're the only girl in the world who can make him feel calm and peaceful."

Victoria's eyes were moist, and she choked out, "Where did he go?"

"He went to the polar regions to see the aurora. He originally wanted to take you with him during your annual leave, but it seems you hurt him pretty badly this time. He said he wanted to give you time to think it over. If you ultimately choose not to be with him, he will still wish you happiness," Ryan said with a bitter smile.

Hearing this, Victoria's heart tightened.

"I understand. Thank you for telling me!" she said, then turned and quickly ran away.

Ryan watched her back and sighed deeply, feeling sorry for Samuel.

He really didn't understand what Victoria was thinking. Samuel was mature, handsome, and talented. How could he not compare to the fickle William?

Did all women have a masochistic streak?

Did they all like scoundrels and jerks?

After placing the painting back in the gallery, Victoria took the subway home in a daze.

When she was almost home, she saw a new barbecue restaurant had opened at the entrance of her community. She suddenly wanted to drink.

Victoria ordered some skewers and a dozen beers, drinking, crying, and laughing, like a madwoman.

Victoria got completely drunk.

She took out her phone from her bag and dialed Samuel's number.

She couldn't get through.

Of course, he was watching the aurora now. How could he answer her call?

Victoria hung up and asked the owner for another dozen beers, continuing to drink.

Victoria's mind was filled with images of Samuel and those paintings.

At the table next to her, a few middle-aged men were also drunk, and their eyes soon fell on Victoria.

###chapter 92 Playing the Hero

At this moment, a man with a face full of flesh, reeking of alcohol, staggered over to Victoria.

He looked at Victoria with a malicious glint in his eyes and mumbled, "Hey pretty lady, drinking alone? Let me join you."

Victoria was taken aback and slightly raised her head. The strong smell of alcohol prevented her from realizing the danger in front of her. She instinctively waved her hand, "I don't need it, thank you."

"How could you not need it? Such a beautiful girl should have someone to drink with!" Another man chimed in, a mysterious smile playing on his lips.

Victoria felt a wave of discomfort and irritation. She wanted to avoid them but was surrounded by their laughter and teasing.

She tried to stand up but lost her balance due to her drunkenness and almost fell.

"Stay away from me!" Victoria glared at them, but this only provoked more laughter.

The owner of the barbecue restaurant couldn't stand it anymore and wanted to intervene, but one of the men stopped him, "Mind your own business, or you'll regret it."

The owner shrank back in fear.

The other customers in the restaurant didn't dare to make a sound, afraid of getting involved.

"Miss, you're so thin, drinking is bad for your health. If you get a stomachache, I'll feel terrible." The man with the fleshy face reached out to touch Victoria's cheek, his rough palm rubbing against her delicate skin.

Victoria recoiled in disgust and slapped his hand away.

"You bitch! How dare you!" The man was furious and raised his hand to slap Victoria.

Victoria retreated several steps, and just as the man was about to strike, a dark shadow loomed over him, blocking his way. A fist landed heavily on his nose, causing him to clutch his nose in pain and scream.

William kicked him to the ground, stepping on his chest, and said coldly, "Get lost!"

"You bitch, how dare you hit me?" The man struggled to get up and swung his arm at William, but William caught his wrist, causing him to feel a bone-crushing pain.

He screamed in agony, his face contorted with pain.

Seeing this, his companions grabbed chairs or bottles and threw them at William. William kicked the chairs away and then picked two up, mercilessly smashing it on them.

Cries of pain echoed around. William walked towards the man clutching his nose.

Sensing danger, the man tried to run.

With a loud crash, his bulky body hit the wall, and he fell to the ground, groaning in pain.

William stepped on his chest and said coldly, "You're lucky tonight. If I see you again, you won't be so fortunate!"

With that, he released his foot and helped Victoria up from the ground.

Her eyes were red, and tears stained her face, making her look very pitiful.

A hint of heartache flashed in William's eyes.

Victoria opened her eyes in a daze, staring blankly at William.

William squatted beside her, placing his hands on her shoulders, "What's wrong? Don't you recognize me?"

Victoria stared at him for a moment, then threw herself into his arms.

"Dad, they were bullying me," Victoria mumbled, hugging William and crying loudly.

William's hand paused, then he patted her back and sighed helplessly, "There, there, don't cry."

Victoria buried her head in his chest, inhaling his familiar scent, and gradually stopped crying.

After a while, Victoria looked up at William and suddenly asked, "Dad, did I do something wrong to make you angry? Tell me, I'll change! Please don't leave me again."

William was silent for a moment. As he carried her on his back, he said, "You didn't do anything wrong. It was my fault."

Victoria blinked in confusion, letting William carry her.

She nestled on William's warm, broad back, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath, feeling comforted by his familiar scent.

"Dad, where did you go? I missed you so much. I thought you didn't want me anymore. I was so scared."

"I'm sorry for making you suffer."

Victoria leaned on his back, swaying gently, "Dad, you can't lie to me. I really missed you. Mom only likes Bobby. She..."

Thinking of Nora, Victoria's tears welled up again, "Dad, I'm so tired and exhausted."

She choked and sobbed, her tears soaking William's coat.

His breathing became uneven, and his heart ached.

Victoria wrapped her arms around William's neck, "Dad, I want to go back to school, but I can't. Mom needs to be hospitalized, and Bobby needs to go to school. You told me to stay out of her and Bobby's business, but Mom said if I don't give her money, she'll go to the media and expose my relationship with William."

Victoria cried even harder, her eyes swollen and sore, tears streaming down like a river breaking its banks. She cried so hard it was heart-wrenching.

"Dad, I've embarrassed you. I'm a bad girl. I sold myself for money. That Alice even called me a prostitute."

The more Victoria spoke, the more upset and aggrieved she felt.

It was as if she was venting all the pent-up emotions from so long. She became more and more agitated, eventually crying so hard she could barely breathe.

William's heart tightened. He quickly carried her back to her home, took the key from her bag, and opened the door.

He gently placed her on the sofa, poured her a glass of water, and handed it to her.

"Drink some water first, don't cry." William coaxed softly.

Victoria held the warm cup, her eyes downcast, not speaking.

William sat beside her, gently rubbing her long hair, speaking softly, "Don't cry. I'll teach them a lesson for you, okay?"

Victoria slowly looked up, her eyes red and swollen, and suddenly jumped into his arms, "Dad, you know what? I drove away the only person who really cared about me."

William's body stiffened slightly at the word "only."

Victoria continued to cling to him like a cat seeking shelter.

William sighed, picked her up, walked to the bed, and laid her down, covering her with a blanket. He then said softly, "Sleep."

His voice was gentle and doting, making it hard not to be drawn in.

"Okay." Victoria responded, pulling the blanket over her head.

William turned off the light and was about to leave.

Victoria grabbed his hand, crying, "Dad, don't go!"

William's body trembled, then he leaned down and kissed her forehead, "Okay."

He then took off his coat, lay down on the bed, and held Victoria in his arms, gently patting her back, "There, there, sleep. I'm not going anywhere."

Feeling William's presence, Victoria felt much more at ease and soon fell asleep.

A faint smile of happiness and contentment appeared on her lips.

William looked at her sweet face, his eyes deepening, and his throat felt dry.

Since the last time at Snowflake Peak, it had been almost a month since he had made love.

Now, with her lying in his arms, her cute and charming sleeping face so close, his body felt hot, and a certain part of him began to stir.

William swallowed, forcing himself to look away, but he couldn't control his growing desire.

Victoria felt a bit cold and murmured, instinctively moving closer to the heat source, mumbling, "So warm."

This low moan acted like a catalyst, causing William to completely lose control. He took the initiative and sealed Victoria's incessant lips with his own.

###chapter 93 Unexpected Passionate Night

He forcefully sucked and bit Victoria's soft, pink tongue, wantonly exploring her territory, savoring the sweetness tinged with the taste of alcohol.

Victoria moaned softly, her hands tightly wrapped around his waist, clumsily responding to William's kiss. She also extended her tongue, chasing after his lips and tongue.

William's breathing became rapid, and his body grew increasingly hot.

Victoria, teased to the point of discomfort, kept pressing closer to him, her delicate nose touching his burning chest.

Victoria's breathing grew heavier, and she restlessly twisted her body, as if yearning for something.

William's rationality had long since vanished. He tore off Victoria's bra, revealing her rounded shoulders.

He pressed her beneath him, his rough hands caressing her smooth, delicate skin.

Victoria's body shuddered sensitively. She tilted her head back, gasping, her brows exuding a seductive charm.

William kissed Victoria's lips, then pulled down her panties, grasping her breasts, teasing and playing with her clitoris tirelessly.

Victoria moaned in discomfort, her hands gripping William's strong shoulders, her body arching, her nails digging deeply into his flesh, leaving clear marks.

Her body instinctively responded to him, as if it were being ignited by a flame. She wanted more!

William's hands roamed over her body, caressing her, causing her to tremble.

Victoria opened her hazy eyes, seeing the blurry outline of the man in front of her.

She couldn't help but moan.

William's body tensed, his eyes turning red.

His fingers skillfully intertwined between her legs, grabbing her buttocks and moving rhythmically.

Victoria's feet clamped tightly around William's waist, her whole body curling up.

Victoria's body was very sensitive. With each stimulation from William, she trembled all over, her hands gripping his shoulders tightly, her knuckles turning white.

William's eyes darkened as he saw her expression.

Victoria moaned in discomfort. William lifted her legs, spreading them apart, straightening his waist.

Victoria felt a strange stimulation, her body instantly tensing.

William grunted, thrusting into her forcefully.

Victoria felt the liquid inside her slowly seeping out, flowing down her legs.

Seeing this, William's eyes grew even darker. He held Victoria's slender waist, flipping her over, making her lie on the bed with her buttocks facing him.

He knelt on one knee on the bed, his long fingers pinching her buttocks, gently pushing.

Victoria closed her eyes, enduring the pleasure he gave her.

William looked at Victoria's flushed cheeks and seductive lips beneath him, a trace of heat flashing in his eyes.

Victoria's mouth was slightly open, panting continuously.

He buried his head in her neck, deeply inhaling her unique fragrance.

Victoria, drunk and dazed, rubbed against his body, murmuring, "Not enough."

Her soft, sweet voice reached William's bones, making him want to devour her immediately.

"Victoria, call me 'darling'," William coaxed by her ear.

Victoria opened her eyes in confusion, looking at William's handsome features, a trace of bewilderment in her eyes. She murmured, "Darling!"

"Yes," William's lips curved into a satisfied smile. He pressed Victoria beneath him again, taking her forcefully.

He thrust wildly, each movement seeming to break through the shackles of body and soul.

Victoria, unable to think under his thrusts, could only follow his rhythm.

His body was as hard as iron, each thrust like an electric current running through her body. She felt like she was about to die.

She clung to him, her legs wrapped around his strong waist, letting him manipulate her. She felt pleasure, enjoying this feeling that made her forget all pain, wanting only to merge with him.

Feeling her initiative, William ravaged her even more vigorously, his actions brutal and domineering, full of aggression.

Victoria moaned in discomfort, her body growing wetter, her hands tightly gripping his hair, wanting more.

William roared, finally releasing his semen inside her.

Victoria lay limp in his arms, motionless, her body aching, even her arms too weak to lift.

She squinted her hazy eyes, looking at the familiar face beneath her, suddenly feeling a bit dazed, as if she had returned to twenty years ago.

"Darling!" she murmured.

William looked down at the beautiful, trembling Victoria in his arms, her body still shaking from pleasure.

"Victoria, who am I?" he asked in a hoarse voice.

Still drunk, Victoria frowned and said, "You're William, my sweetheart."

Her words filled William's eyes with intense desire, his penis erecting again.

But seeing her exhausted face, he restrained himself, instead fetching a warm towel to wipe her body and dressing her in clean pajamas.

Only after she fell asleep did he leave the room.

William stood at the door, lighting a cigarette, leaning against the wall to smoke.

After a long time, he glanced at Victoria's door, then turned and left.

When Victoria woke up, it was already light outside.

She felt not only a headache but also like her whole body had been run over, her limbs aching.

She only remembered drinking a lot last night and then passing out. As for what happened afterward, she couldn't recall at all.

She lifted the quilt to look at her body. Apart from some bruises, there were no other injuries.

Did she get drunk and fall on her way home?

She tried to recall last night's events but couldn't remember anything.

Forget it, it didn't matter.

She got dressed, ready to go to work, when her phone suddenly rang. She glanced at the number.

It was Samuel calling.

Victoria felt like something was stuck in her chest, her throat tightening.

After a moment of silence, Victoria pressed the answer button, and Samuel's familiar, gentle voice came through the phone.

"Victoria, I was at the polar region last night, no signal, so I missed your call."

Victoria instantly felt her face flush. Did she call Samuel when she was drunk last night?

Her heart raced. She bit her lip, pretending to be calm, and said, "No, it's nothing!"

Samuel paused for a moment, then asked in a low voice, "Did you call me for something?"

Victoria bit her lip, unsure how to respond. After hesitating for a while, she said, "I, I just dialed the wrong number, it's nothing. I'll hang up now, I'm getting ready."

Samuel didn't say anything more, just responded, "Okay."

Then both of them fell silent, neither speaking again.

Just as Victoria was about to hang up, Samuel suddenly said, "Victoria, I won't be attending your award ceremony."

###chapter 94 Tit for Tat

Victoria was taken aback and asked, "What award ceremony?"

"You haven't received the invitation yet?" Samuel asked in confusion, "I clearly told..."

Samuel seemed to remember something, smiled wryly, and said, "Sorry, Victoria, I'll have someone send the invitation to you later. Your work for the competition won the gold medal."

"Really?" Victoria exclaimed in surprise. She hadn't expected that the work she had given up hope on would actually win an award.

"Yes, congratulations," Samuel said with a smile.

"Thank you, Samuel." At this moment, Victoria had forgotten the awkward relationship between them.

"Victoria," Samuel paused for a few seconds and then said, "I need to sketch from my surroundings now, so I'll hang up now. Take care."

"Okay." Victoria paused for a moment and then hung up the phone.

Samuel held his phone, standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, looking at the distant blue sky. A self-deprecating smile flickered across his lips.

He tossed the phone onto the table, picked up a paintbrush, and began working on a new piece.

The award ceremony was on Saturday evening. Victoria rented a gown, did her own makeup and hair, and then headed to the venue.

Tonight's award ceremony was grand, with celebrities from all walks of life and extensive media coverage.

Victoria sat in the audience, scanning the room. She not only saw Diana but also William and Alice.

Of course, William was not only the owner of the largest media company in Silvermist City but also the second-largest shareholder of Starry Studio Gallery. Naturally, he would be invited. Their presence here was not surprising.

Victoria's gaze finally settled on William.

He was wearing a white suit, his tall figure looking even more imposing.

His expression was indifferent, his demeanor elegant and noble, exuding an innate aristocratic aura.

Alice, holding his arm, was all smiles, and the two of them were the focus of everyone's envy.

Victoria felt a pang of bitterness. Seeing Alice's happy demeanor and remembering her previous insults, Victoria felt a tightness in her chest.

She forced herself to look away.

At that moment, a familiar figure entered through the door.

Bobby!

Why was he here too?

She widened her eyes in surprise.

Bobby also saw Victoria, but he wasn't surprised. A mocking smile appeared on his lips as he walked to the seat next to her, pulled the chair aside, and sat directly opposite her.

Victoria frowned slightly. She really disliked his arrogant demeanor and wondered where he got his confidence from.

"Victoria, long time no see!" Bobby said in a sarcastic tone.

"Long time no see, Bobby!" Victoria's eyes coldly stared at Bobby.

Now, she felt an inexplicable aversion to him.

Bobby sneered, "You'd better not get involved with me. I don't want your scandals affecting me."

Victoria snorted coldly, "Who do you think you are? A thief!"

Bobby's face darkened, and he glared at Victoria, "What nonsense are you spouting?"

"Isn't it true? You stole my painting. Aren't you a thief?" Victoria retorted.

"Victoria, shut up!" Bobby looked around and growled.

Victoria raised her chin, glaring at him provocatively, "Who are you to yell at me? Bobby, you're despicable. The work you submitted for the national competition was stolen from me. Are you here to receive an award for another stolen piece today?"

"You're unreasonable! I don't want to waste my breath on you! We'll see." Bobby glared at Victoria and turned away.

Victoria sneered, "Bobby, I'm telling you, this is the last time I'll tolerate you. If you steal my painting or frame me again, I'll take you down with me!"

"Who do you think you are? I'm not afraid of you!" Bobby said arrogantly.

"Really? In that case, let's wait and see." Victoria sneered, looking at his arrogant demeanor, wanting to slap him.

"Try exposing me. Mom won't forgive you."

"Mom?" Victoria sneered, "Since she doesn't treat me as her daughter, why should I consider her my mom?"

No matter what happened, Nora always sided with Bobby, never considering Emily's feelings.

Especially after Alvin's incident, Nora treated her as a money-making tool and a pawn to be used, never caring about her.

She would rather not have such a mother.

Bobby's expression changed slightly, then returned to normal, "Victoria, stop trying to scare me. Do you think I'll believe you?"

"Believe it or not." Victoria finished speaking and no longer looked at him.

Bobby gritted his teeth, a cold glint in his eyes.

Victoria didn't want to continue entangling with him. Seeing that there was still half an hour before the award ceremony, she got up and walked to the buffet area.

Bobby watched Victoria's back, his fists clenched, a murderous look in his eyes.

'Victoria, since you don't know what's good for you, don't blame me for being ruthless!' he thought.

He narrowed his eyes, staring darkly in the direction Victoria left.

Victoria picked some of her favorite fruits, found a quiet corner, and sat down to eat quietly, waiting for the award ceremony to begin.

William sat in the audience, his deep eyes watching her out of the corner of his eye.

Seeing her like a little hamster, slowly eating the food on her plate, her cheeks puffed up, he couldn't help but smile.

Victoria sensed someone watching her, turned her head, and their eyes met. She frowned slightly, then looked away, continuing to eat the delicious food on her plate.

Seeing this, William frowned, feeling inexplicably irritated.

Alice followed his gaze and saw Victoria.

She sneered, then leaned close to William's ear and said, "William, the award ceremony is about to start. You're the opening guest, let's take our seats."

"Okay," William responded, getting up and following Alice to his seat.

The award ceremony was about to begin. The host took the stage, and the audience applauded warmly.

Victoria returned to her seat, waiting for the ceremony to start.

The host said a few opening remarks and then announced, "Next, let's welcome Mr. Scott, the renowned CEO of the Scott Group, to deliver a speech for our art association's award ceremony!"

###chapter 95 Stop Slandering Me!

As soon as the words were spoken, the lights in the hall dimmed suddenly.

William slowly stood up and walked towards the center of the stage.

A spotlight shone on him, highlighting his tall and dignified figure. He seemed to stride through the light with an air of nobility, each step exuding an unparalleled aura of grace.

All eyes were fixed on him, and the audience collectively held their breath.

Once William reached the center, he clasped his hands together and nodded slightly. His magnetic voice resonated through the microphone, "It's an honor to be here at the Art Association's award ceremony."

He paused, glancing around the room before his gaze settled on Victoria. A slight smile curved his lips as he continued, "First, I want to congratulate today's award-winning artists. Your works are truly remarkable. I hope you continue to pour your energy into your creations, bringing more excellent works to the world and promoting Crystalia's art globally."

As William concluded his speech, thunderous applause erupted from the audience. He stepped back behind the curtain, and the host immediately took the stage to introduce this year's award winners.

Bobby won the silver award for Victoria's painting "The Wounded White Deer." Being the youngest among the winners, he received significant praise and attention.

Victoria watched him bask in the adulation on stage, a mocking smile playing on her lips.

'How shameless,' she thought. He took her work to win an award and had the audacity to revel in it!

With the announcement of the silver award, the ceremony reached its peak.

The host, smiling, announced, "Next, let's congratulate Ms. Carter for winning the gold award. Her piece 'Seeking Warmth' deeply moved every judge."

The screen lit up with the artwork, depicting a small yet warm corner under towering concrete buildings where an old man and a stray cat shared a moment. The sketch highlighted the city's coldness and the old man's tenderness towards the cat.

"Beautiful."

"No wonder she's Joshua's student; such a clever concept."

The audience murmured, not just in admiration of the painting but also because of Victoria's identity.

William, seated below, kept his eyes on the screen displaying the artwork.

Though he had only glanced at it briefly, he couldn't deny its brilliance.

Alice noticed his reaction. A hint of sarcasm crept into her smile as she thought, 'Well, Victoria, enjoy your moment while it lasts.'

She glanced at Bobby, who gave her a slight nod.

"Now, let's welcome Ms. Carter to the stage to receive her award," the host announced.

Victoria, both nervous and excited, stood up and walked lightly to the stage.

As she reached the center, the lights brightened, illuminating her and making her shine.

She wore a pure white off-shoulder evening gown, the hem reaching her knees, cinched at the waist to accentuate her slender figure. The unique floral design on her chest, adorned with two pieces of sheer fabric, added a touch of mystery. Her long hair cascaded down her back, and her bright, delicate features exuded an ethereal charm.

The host, smiling warmly, asked, "Ms. Carter, do you have anything to say about winning the gold award today?"

Victoria smiled and replied, "Thank you all for this opportunity. I will continue to work hard."

The audience applauded, cheering for her.

"Finally, let's welcome Mr. Scott to present the gold award," the host invited with a smile.

William stood up once more and walked towards the stage.

"Congratulations," William said, taking the trophy from the usher and handing it to Victoria.

His deep eyes, like a bottomless pool, revealed no emotion yet seemed to draw one in.

"Thank you," Victoria said, momentarily stunned before reaching out to accept the trophy.

But in the next second, Bobby suddenly stood up and shouted, "Wait! I have something to say!"

His words immediately drew everyone's attention.

Victoria froze, a sense of unease creeping in.

She knew Bobby had always harbored resentment towards her, and this was the perfect moment for him to strike.

"Victoria, even though you're my sister, I have to say that the painting you won the gold award with isn't yours!" Bobby's voice was loud and clear. "That painting is mine. I can't believe you had the audacity to steal it and enter it into the competition!"

The audience erupted in whispers, their eyes darting between the two siblings.

Victoria's face turned pale. She wanted to defend herself but was rendered speechless by the sudden accusation.

William's expression darkened, a cold aura emanating from him.

Bobby felt a chill run down his spine as he met William's sharp, menacing gaze, causing him to shrink back slightly.

But remembering the hefty reward Alice had promised, he gritted his teeth and continued, "Anyone can see that the brushstrokes and style of my piece are identical to hers. This proves that Victoria stole my work!"

As Bobby finished speaking, the audience buzzed with discussion.

"So Victoria stole her brother's work?"

"This is a disgrace to the art community!"

"I can't believe I thought Victoria's work was good!"

"Is she really Joshua's student? Did she deceive him too?"

The audience's condemnation grew louder, some even questioning Joshua's judgment.

"Bobby, stop slandering me!" Victoria demanded angrily, forcing herself to stay calm. "This isn't true! You're the one who stole my work, and I didn't expose you. Now you're twisting the facts?"

"Ridiculous! If this piece was stolen from you, then was my first-place piece in the national competition a few months ago also stolen? Anyone can check and see if my style matches these two paintings!" Bobby retorted confidently, glancing smugly at Victoria.

The audience quickly pulled out their phones to verify the information.

Sure enough, Bobby's award-winning piece had the same style as the two paintings in question.

The crowd erupted, loudly condemning Victoria and demanding her disqualification.

Victoria's face turned ashen, her mind buzzing, and she swayed, nearly collapsing.

###chapter 96 This is Alvin's Daughter!

William caught her just in time.

"William, I didn't do it!" Victoria's eyes were red, tears welling up and threatening to spill over.

"I know you wouldn't," William reassured her softly.

Victoria bit her lip, looking into his deep eyes. Her nose tingled, and she almost started crying.

She couldn't understand why this was happening.

Suddenly, she remembered her Instagram account where she documented her painting process. That could prove that she was the true artist, and Bobby was the thief.

With trembling hands, she grabbed the microphone and, holding back her sobs, said, "Judges, guests, I painted these pieces myself. Bobby is lying. I have proof!"

Everyone was stunned and turned to look at Bobby.

Bobby, however, remained unfazed. He smirked and said mockingly, "Proof? What proof could you possibly have? Victoria, just admit it and apologize. Otherwise, not only will your reputation be ruined, but you'll also drag Mr. Thomas down with you."

"Enough, shut up!" Victoria's eyes were bloodshot as she glared at Bobby.

She turned her head, scanning the room, and choked out, "I always document my painting process on Instagram. These records can prove that I painted these."

Victoria finished speaking and took out her phone, ready to log into her Instagram to clear her name.

However, when she tried to log in, the system notified her that her account had been frozen.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. She logged out and tried again, but it still didn't work.

"How could this happen?" she murmured, "Why is this happening?"

Bobby sneered, "Victoria, stop acting. Just admit your mistake and apologize!"

Victoria whipped around, her eyes blazing, "It was you! You did this!"

"Victoria, what nonsense are you spouting now? How could a poor student like me get your account banned?" Bobby retorted sarcastically.

By now, the audience was tired of Victoria's defense and started shouting for her to apologize and leave.

Seeing that Victoria had become the target of everyone's anger, William quickly escorted her off the stage.

As they reached the bottom of the stage, Alice suddenly appeared, blocking their way.

Alice looked at Victoria with disdain and sneered, "I didn't expect you to be so shameless! How could you steal your own brother's work and enter it into the competition?"

"I didn't!" Victoria clenched her fists, struggling to control her emotions.

Alice curled her lip in contempt, "It's bad enough that you're embarrassing yourself, but do you have to drag William down with you?"

William wanted to say something, but Alice cut him off, "William, don't forget, I'm your girlfriend. If you take Victoria away in front of everyone, do you want her to be humiliated even more?"

William frowned at her words.

He looked around at the crowd, who were filled with disgust for Victoria, and at the media, who were constantly filming. After a moment of hesitation, he let go of Victoria's arm and stepped aside.

Victoria stared at him in shock, her eyes red, tears glistening on her lashes, ready to fall at any moment.

"Aren't you going to leave?" Alice snorted.

Victoria clutched her dress tightly, suppressing her overwhelming sense of injustice, and ran out of the venue.

Watching Victoria's panicked retreat, Alice twisted her face into a sinister smile.

William watched her leave, a complex emotion flickering in his eyes.

His gaze swept over Alice, who was gloating, and a trace of annoyance crossed his brow. He turned indifferently and walked out of the venue.

Victoria had just run out of the venue when she was surrounded by reporters.

"Ms. Carter, did you really steal Bobby's work?"

"Did you win the gold medal by cheating?"

"Don't you think you're tarnishing your teacher's reputation by doing this?"

The reporters' aggressive questions bombarded Victoria's ears. She covered her ears and ran desperately.

The reporters chased her relentlessly, following her to the elevator.

"Ms. Carter, please answer our questions!"

The reporters were persistent, continuously asking questions.

Victoria, with red-rimmed eyes, tried to avoid their cameras, but the more she dodged, the sharper their questions became.

She finally broke free and ran to the roadside, hoping to catch a cab.

A van suddenly swerved in front of her.

The door opened, and seven or eight people, including an elderly man and a few teenagers, got out.

Seeing Victoria, they rushed over and started attacking her.

"That damn Alvin! This is his daughter!"

"Is your father even human? His bridge design collapsed, killing so many people! Those workers' and managers' families are ruined!"

"Everyone, look! This is Alvin's daughter!"

Victoria's hair was disheveled, her clothes being pulled by several hands. She bit her lip, protecting herself as best as she could.

"Hit her! Hit her!"

"Alvin's daughter must be just as bad! She must be involved in those shady dealings!"

"Look at her! She must be a loose woman! Her father is a murderer, and she's a disgrace!"

More and more people gathered, whispering.

The media, who had been chasing Victoria, swarmed over like flies to a carcass, their cameras flashing incessantly.

The name "Alvin" reminded many of the catastrophic bridge collapse.

Due to a design flaw, the bridge had collapsed during construction, burying many workers and managers, ending their lives in an instant.

Some onlookers, unable to bear seeing a young woman being bullied, wanted to help but were stopped by their companions.

This was something they couldn't get involved in.

If they intervened, they would become targets themselves.

After all, the disaster Alvin caused was too severe, and these families needed an outlet for their anger.

Being Alvin's daughter seemed like an inescapable sin.

Victoria's face was bruised and swollen, her lips bleeding, tears streaming down her face.

She didn't fight back, curling up and silently enduring the pain.

Suddenly, a coat was thrown over her head, and she was pulled into a warm embrace.

###chapter 97 I Won't Let Them Bully You Anymore

"William!" Victoria whispered, tears streaming down her face.

William pulled her close, his eyes blazing as he glared at the people who had been attacking her. An aura of terrifying anger radiated from him.

The onlookers, feeling the chill emanating from William, took a few steps back in fear.

"Listen up," William growled, his voice low and menacing, "if anyone lays a finger on her again, I'll make sure they regret it."

The attackers swallowed nervously. They didn't know who William was, but his presence alone was enough to make them tremble.

Alice had come out to watch the spectacle, never expecting William to rush in and defend Victoria like this. After all, Alvin, the man responsible for his parents' deaths, was someone William had always hated the most. How could he be so protective of that woman?

Alice's chest ached with anger. She suppressed her fury and feigned concern, saying, "William, be careful not to get hurt yourself. Come back here."

William hadn't been this angry in years. This time, he was truly furious. He had just left the conference hall when he saw a large group of people surrounding and beating Victoria. Her frail body couldn't possibly withstand such an assault. And some despicable men were even taking the opportunity to sexually harass her!

William's eyes narrowed with a vicious glint, and a cold, murderous aura surrounded him. He reached out with his long, elegant fingers, grabbed a lecherous middle-aged man, and threw him to the ground with force.

The man screamed in pain.

William's icy gaze then fell on two other lecherous men. He kicked them both in the ribs, causing them to collapse to the ground, writhing in agony.

Suppressing his violent emotions, William bent down and lifted Victoria into his arms, striding towards the car without looking back.

Victoria buried her face in his broad chest, her tears soaking his expensive cashmere sweater. William felt a sharp pain in his heart, a dull ache spreading through his body, making it hard to breathe. He thought of how she had been bullied. If he hadn't been there, the consequences would have been unbearable.

Since Alvin's arrest, Victoria had dropped out of college and, for Nora's sake, had become his sugar baby. She had been bullied by Ella and Alice, cyberbullied, humiliated, and even he had been one of her tormentors.

William closed his eyes, trying to convince himself that she deserved all this because she was Alvin's daughter, the man who had caused his parents' deaths. But seeing others hurt Victoria made him feel a pang of guilt and heartache.

He lowered his gaze, his deep eyes flickering with a dark light, and his thin lips pressed together. He held her soft, fragrant body tightly.

"Don't cry," William sighed softly. "I'll take you to the hospital."

Victoria nodded, feeling a sense of calm wash over her in William's strong embrace. She knew that as long as she was with him, she would be safe.

Bobby, lurking in the shadows, waited for the crowd to thin out before approaching Alice.

"Ms. Garcia, I took a big risk with this," he said, his voice low.

Alice gave him a sly smile. "You did well. The money's already in your account."

Bobby's face lit up with a sycophantic grin. "Thank you, Ms. Garcia."

"I'll arrange for the media to interview you later. Make sure to destroy Victoria's reputation so she can't bounce back," Alice said, her tone dripping with malice, making Bobby shiver.

He felt a twinge of guilt but quickly brushed it aside, thinking of the wealthy classmates who flaunted their riches. If Alvin hadn't failed, he wouldn't have to take such risks himself.

"Don't worry, Ms. Garcia. I'll make sure Victoria is disgraced and ruined."

At the hospital, William stayed with Victoria through her examination.

"Nothing serious, just some superficial injuries. She just needs to rest for a few days," the doctor advised before leaving.

William nodded, watching the sleeping Victoria. Her delicate body was covered in bruises, and the red handprints on her cheeks were particularly shocking. He picked up a cotton swab, dipped it in iodine, and began to disinfect her wounds.

"Please, it hurts. Stop hitting me," Victoria whimpered in her sleep, her brow furrowed as if trapped in a nightmare.

William's heart ached with pity. It reminded him of his own helplessness when he was bullied after his parents' death. He applied the ointment gently, massaging her swollen areas to ease the pain.

Victoria sighed softly, her brow relaxing as she continued to sleep. He tenderly stroked her swollen cheek and whispered, "It's okay now."

He looked out at the dark sky, his eyes filled with complex emotions. "I won't let them hurt you again, including myself."

His voice was hoarse, filled with exhaustion and helplessness. William took out his phone and texted Harry: [Suppress tonight's incident. No reports.]

Harry hesitated before sending: [Mr. Scott, tonight's incident was quite public, and it involves the art association's competition.We need to clear Ms. Carter's name first.]

William replied: [I trust you'll find a way.]

Harry stared at the dark screen, muttering to himself, 'Mr. Scott was pushing me to take extreme measures. But what choice did I have? He's the boss.'

William rubbed his temples and stood up. Just as he was about to step out for a smoke, he saw Alice standing outside the room, arms crossed, glaring at him.

He frowned but ignored her.

Alice said coldly, "You took her away in front of everyone. Have you thought about how people will mock me?"

William lit a cigarette, exhaling a smoke ring, and asked nonchalantly, "Did you do this?"

###chapter 98 Just Kill Me!

His voice was cold and distant, like a frost-covered morning.

Alice gritted her teeth and snapped, "So what if it was me? I was just teaching that bitch a lesson. She keeps hanging around you."

"Is that so?" William sneered, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "She wasn't hanging around me. I was the one hanging around her."

Alice was stunned for a moment, then burst into a sharp laugh. "William, are you serious? Do you like her? What about me? Didn't you promise to marry me?"

She looked at him with hopeful eyes, her tears threatening to fall.

Seeing her like this, William's heart softened, and his tone became gentler. "Alice, I will keep my promise to you, but please, stop causing trouble for Victoria."

"You're actually pleading for her?" Alice shouted, her eyes misting over.

She shook her head in disbelief. "Are you crazy? Her father killed your parents, and you still defend her?"

Her voice grew more agitated, and she pointed a trembling finger at him, screaming hysterically, "I'll leave her alone if you cut ties with her completely!"

William narrowed his eyes, staring at her menacingly.

"Alice, I'm warning you. Do not harm her. Or else, don't blame me for what happens next."

His sudden anger startled Alice. She looked at him in disbelief. "You're threatening me for that bitch? I love you so much, I've given up everything for you, and this is how you treat me?"

William extinguished his cigarette in the trash can, his gaze icy. "I'm not negotiating with you."

Alice was momentarily stunned, then she laughed maniacally, her smile twisted and cruel.

"Let her go? Sure! Just kill me! Kill me, and everything will be solved!"

William's eyes darkened, and a terrifying aura emanated from him.

Alice met his gaze fearlessly, the tension between them palpable.

After a long silence, William finally reined in his anger, his voice calm but seething with fury. "Alice, stop this nonsense!"

Alice sneered. "William, you know me. Since I was a child, I never let anyone take what's mine without a fight!"

With that, she pushed past William and walked away, her back resolute.

William stood there for a long time, his deep eyes lowered, making it impossible to guess what he was thinking.

After a while, he took out his phone. "Dr. Simmons, about Alice's condition..." 

When Victoria woke up, it was already early morning. The room was silent.

Her whole body ached, and she barely had the strength to sit up.

She opened her bleary eyes, seeing the white sheets and smelling the strong scent of disinfectant.

A needle was inserted into the back of her hand, with fluid slowly dripping into her veins.

Where was she?

She blinked hard, her mind gradually clearing as she remembered everything that had happened that night.

Struggling to sit up, she saw William asleep on the small sofa in the hospital room, his tall frame looking cramped.

Victoria's heart softened.

She hadn't expected William to leave Alice to save her in such a situation.

After being betrayed by those closest to her and humiliated by everyone, only William had stood up to protect her.

Tears welled up in Victoria's eyes. She sniffled, carefully walking over to him and lying down beside him, nestling against his broad chest.

This was her only safe haven, the only place she could escape the storm.

Even though she knew he would never be hers.

But just for today, she allowed herself to be greedy, just this once.

Victoria hugged William's lean waist tightly, feeling a sense of security she had never known.

William seemed to sense something, opening his eyes and looking down at her. "You're awake."

"Yeah," Victoria replied, gazing up at his chiseled features, her heart warming. "Thanks for saving me."

William held her tighter, unable to resist planting a light kiss on her lips. "How are you feeling now?"

"I'm okay," she said lightly, her gaze drifting.

William rubbed her head gently, murmuring, "Silly girl, you're so hurt, yet you still pretend to be strong."

"I'm fine," Victoria forced a smile. "It's just some minor injuries."

William looked at her for a few seconds, his lips pressed into a thin line.

After a while, he spoke in a low voice, "Are you hungry? I had some soup prepared. Get up and have some."

Victoria nodded. "Okay."

William helped her sit up, placing a pillow behind her.

Victoria drank the soup, feeling a bit more comfortable.

William looked at her bruised face and took out some ointment to apply.

Victoria sat quietly, letting him carefully apply the ointment, her voice hoarse. "I must look awful now, right?"

William glanced at her and smirked. "Not too bad."

Though she looked battered, there was a certain beauty in her vulnerability that was oddly captivating.

He continued to apply the ointment, and Victoria pouted, mumbling, "You're just humoring me. You're not honest at all."

"You don't believe me?" William asked, his eyes deep.

Victoria shook her head.

"Then feel this," he said with a mischievous smile, grabbing her hand and placing it on his lower abdomen. "See if it's honest."

Victoria gasped, pulling her hand back in a panic, her face flushing. "William, you're such a rogue! You can get aroused anytime, anywhere!"

He chuckled, raising an eyebrow with a hint of roguishness. "Not always."

Victoria was speechless, shocked by his shamelessness.

William was too much for her to handle.

William's eyes darkened with desire as he saw her blushing face. He spoke hoarsely, "Victoria."

Hearing him call her name, Victoria shivered, instinctively trying to put some distance between them.

William held her in place, his thumb caressing her skin, leaning down to gently lick her.

The tingling sensation made her body tense up, and Victoria stared at him in a panic. "Stop it!"

###chapter 99 I Do Have Feelings for You

William didn't say a word. Instead, he silenced her with a kiss.

Victoria tried to resist, wanting to break free from his embrace, but her body was too weak to muster any strength.

"Come on, open your mouth," William coaxed gently, guiding her to swallow as he kissed her, his nimble tongue prying her teeth apart and exploring her sweetness.

His large hand moved to the back of her neck, slowly inching forward, causing her to shiver.

"William, stop..." Victoria tried to push his shoulder away, but he held her tightly.

William released her lips and whispered softly in her ear, "Baby, do you know that every time you call my name, it drives me wild with excitement?"

"You jerk! I'm still in pain!" Victoria's face flushed red as she pounded his firm chest with her fists.

William suppressed his heavy breathing, sweat beading on his forehead, his voice hoarse, "Don't make a fuss, be quiet, let me take care of you."

"William!" Victoria gritted her teeth and called out his name.

"I love it when you call me that," he murmured, nibbling on her delicate earlobe.

Victoria felt a jolt of pleasure course through her body at his touch, making her tremble.

"William, let me go," Victoria pushed against his chest, "I'm so tired, I need to rest."

"I'll be quick!" William's voice was a strained growl.

Victoria closed her eyes, trying to control her impulses and heat, desperately telling herself not to indulge him any further.

Her silence only fueled his desire. His hand slipped under her dress, gently massaging her through her underwear.

Victoria let out a muffled groan, her body stiffening.

William was pleased. He bit her rounded earlobe, his tone seductive, "Be good, I'll be gentle. Just cooperate."

Victoria trembled all over, clutching his shirt tightly, "You need to stop."

She couldn't take it anymore.

Ignoring her plea, he buried his face in her ample bosom, acting wantonly.

Victoria writhed in discomfort, her slender waist twisting.

She was already drenched between her legs, soaking through.

William's eyes burned with desire. He cupped her buttocks with one hand and her breast with the other, gently kneading, "Do you want it?"

Victoria shook her head, "No!"

"No what?" His eyes gleamed menacingly.

Victoria didn't know how to explain, so she bit her lower lip.

"Relax," he whispered seductively in her ear.

His words worked. Gradually, Victoria adapted to his presence, her body becoming more pliant.

Entwined together, the room filled with a sultry, erotic atmosphere.

Victoria lay on the bed, William on top of her, his heavy breaths falling on her collarbone, making her moan softly.

"William," Victoria called out sweetly, "Be gentle!"

William gave a wicked smile and thrust into her body.

Victoria winced in pain, tears welling up in her eyes.

His movements grew more aggressive, and Victoria couldn't help but cry out.

"William, you're hurting me," she whimpered, her voice filled with grievance.

William paused, quickly wiping away her tears with concern.

Victoria bit her lip hard, wrapping her arms around his neck, burying her face in his chest.

He kissed her tenderly, moving slowly.

Victoria moaned softly, "William!"

Her voice was soft and alluring, like an aphrodisiac, stirring him up.

They remained entwined for a long time before finally coming to a stop.

Victoria lay motionless on the bed, unwilling to move. William brought a basin of hot water, wrung out a towel, and began to clean her body.

Victoria lay back, letting him take care of her, her gaze falling on his handsome, chiseled profile. She sighed softly, a strange bitterness welling up inside her.

Tonight, he had been so gentle and attentive, and it felt like a dream.

After cleaning her up, William held her in his arms, kissing her forehead, "What's wrong? Why the sudden sadness?"

She pressed her lips together, hesitated for a few seconds, then asked, "Was today's incident caused by Alice?"

William froze, not answering.

She gave a bitter smile, "I knew it."

"Don't worry," William kissed her forehead, "I won't let her hurt you again."

"You can't do that," Victoria smiled sadly, "She's your precious darling. How could you bear to trouble her?"

William fell silent, his arms tightening around her.

Victoria sighed, "What am I to you? According to Alice, I'm just a tool you bought to satisfy your lust."

"Don't overthink it!" William warned in a low voice.

"I'm not overthinking," Victoria looked at him seriously, "William, tell me honestly, what am I to you? A mistress? A sex buddy? Or a prostitute?"

Her expression was calm, as if stating a fact.

William's face darkened. He stared at her deeply, his lips pressed into a tight line, seemingly contemplating how to respond.

Victoria met his deep gaze, "William, you're my first and only man. Every time I'm in a desperate situation, you're the one who helps me. Although I never wanted to admit it, I do have feelings for you."

She calmly revealed her deepest emotions.

William's heart tightened, as if stung by a bee, a strange feeling spreading through his body. He held her tighter, "You really..."

"Yes," Victoria answered, both ashamed and honest, "If I truly didn't want to sleep with you, could you really force me? I have nothing to lose, I could just end it all."

His body grew even more rigid, his throat constricted, unable to find words to refute her.

"Even though you always threaten me, allowing Ella and Alice to bully me, I still have some hope for you," Victoria smiled self-deprecatingly, "Like just now, you protected me and took care of me so gently. Can I believe that you have feelings for me too?"

Her words pierced through his tough exterior, leaving him bleeding inside.

How could he like her?

She was Alvin's daughter! How could he forgive her? There was no future for them!

###chapter 100 What Should I Do with You?

He forced down the storm of emotions in his heart, suddenly sat up, and said coldly, "No, you're overthinking it. To me, you're just a toy."

When Victoria heard this, it felt like a boulder had struck her heart, causing a dull pain. She blinked her wet eyelashes and forced a smile. "Yeah, I'm just a toy you bought. But I have feelings. If you don't care about me and can't give me a proper place in your life, then don't come looking for me anymore. I don't want to get hurt by your girlfriend because of you. I wish you both happiness in advance."

Hearing this, William's face turned frighteningly dark. He narrowed his long, deep eyes, staring at Victoria with a cold, piercing gaze, as if he wanted to devour her alive.

Victoria met his gaze fearlessly, not blinking.

A surge of anger rose in William's heart. He stood up, looking down at her from above, his eyes shooting out a chilling light. "Fine. Very well!"

With that, he slammed the door and left.

Victoria pulled the blanket over her head, curling up, a tear slipping from the corner of her eye.

She craved the warmth he gave her so much, and she didn't want to say anything to ruin the moment.

But she couldn't let herself get lost in an illusion of happiness; she had to stay clear-headed.

None of this belonged to her in the first place!

For a man like William, the more indifferent you acted towards him, the more he wanted to conquer you.

On the contrary, if you showedaffection first, he would only grow tired and annoyed with you.

Thinking of William's disgusted look just now, she felt her nose tingle, and tears streamed down her cheeks.

He didn't love her, never had.

Victoria closed her eyes, her heart wrenching painfully as if being torn apart.

William slammed the car door shut, stepped on the gas, and sped away.

All the way, he floored the gas pedal.

He didn't understand why, when he heard Victoria's words, a feeling akin to panic surged in his heart.

He hated this uncontrollable feeling.

Of course, he knew why Victoria said she liked him. It was just to use reverse psychology to push him away.

Yet, he had fallen for it and said so many hurtful things to her.

Her bruised body and pained eyes haunted him, as if ants were gnawing at his heart, making it hard to endure. 

A sudden screech of brakes echoed through the city. William's knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel.

'Victoria, what am I supposed to do with you?' he wondered.

Victoria barely slept all night and was woken by her phone ringing.

She opened her tired eyes, groggily reaching for her phone, not even looking at the screen before putting it to her ear.

Samuel's anxious voice came through the line, "Victoria, are you okay?"

Victoria's sleepiness vanished instantly. She sat up quickly, despite the soreness all over her body. "I'm fine."

"I heard your brother accused you of stealing his work, and then you were bullied by a group of people," Samuel's voice was heavy with worry.

Victoria sniffed, trying to steady her emotions. "Don't worry, I'm fine now."

Hearing her choked-up voice, Samuel's heart ached even more. "Victoria, don't be afraid. My studio has surveillance. Those two paintings were completed in my studio. I can testify for you. I won't let anyone falsely accuse you!"

Warmth surged in Victoria's heart. Besides Alvin, Samuel was the one who cared about her the most in this world.

But she kept letting him down.

"Samuel, thank you..." She bit her lip. "I'm sorry for always dragging you into my mess."

Samuel sighed. She still didn't understand that what he wanted to hear was never her thanks.

"Victoria, if you really want to thank me, promise me that when you run into trouble, you'll call me first. I'll do everything I can to protect you!"

Victoria was stunned for a moment, her eyes suddenly turning red. She choked up, "Okay, I promise you!"

After hanging up, Victoria hugged her knees, leaning against the wall, slowly squatting down, burying her head in her arms.

She knew Samuel was sincere.

And she did have feelings for Samuel. He was like a ray of sunshine shining into her dark heart.

She couldn't bear to reject him, but she didn't dare to get close, afraid of tainting this pure beauty.

Maybe one day, when she completely cut ties with William and freed herself from this mess, she wouldn't avoid him anymore.

Victoria was lost in thought for a long time until a nurse came to change her bandages, bringing her back to reality.

After the nurse finished, she nervously opened the trending topics online.

After the last online attack, she was terrified of being dragged into the spotlight again.

She was just an ordinary girl, not strong enough to face endless insults and abuse.

Those clueless netizens were like poisonous wasps, stinging anyone they could.

Such public opinion would drown her, plunging her life back into darkness, never to see the light of day.

But this time, she didn't fall into the abyss as expected.

Despite the huge commotion last night, there wasn't a single stir online today.

Victoria guessed it was William's doing.

But what she didn't know was that to quell the situation, Harry had personally visited each person on the list from last night, deleting all recordings and videos.

He also threatened all media outlets-anyone who dared to report anything negative about Victoria would be seen as against William.

This move silenced all reporters and paparazzi teams, who chose to keep quiet.

Even posts from ordinary netizens disappeared instantly.

Victoria breathed a sigh of relief, no longer worried about her job being affected.

But with her face bruised and swollen, she wasn't fit to go out for work. She applied for two days of remote work with Diana.

Though her pay was significantly lower and her body was in pain, she couldn't keep taking leave.

Diana readily agreed.

In the CEO's office at the Scott Group

Harry knocked and entered, respectfully reporting to William, who was reviewing documents. "Mr. Scott, I've taken care of everything you arranged. All news media have retracted and blocked the stories."

William didn't look up, continuing to review the documents.

He asked coldly, "What about the art association?"

Harry paused for a moment before cautiously speaking, "Mr. Scott, the art association initially refused to suppress the matter, given it involved their gold and silver award winners. But they just called to say Ms. Carter's innocence has been proven, and her awards will be reinstated."

"Proven?" William sneered, his eyes darkening.

###chapter 101 That's Not Enough

"Mr. Scott, I think they're trying to butter you up," Harry said, clearing his throat.

William looked up, his eyes sharp and cold. "You think that's why?"

Harry was caught off guard and then shook his head.

William gave Harry a cold stare, his thin lips parting slightly. "Those old guys at the art association always see themselves as high and mighty. They wouldn't cave so easily. Someone must've done something to make them change their tune so fast."

Harry suddenly got it. "Could it be Samuel?"

William's brow furrowed slightly. "Probably. Go find out what he did."

Harry hesitated for a moment and then suggested, "Mr. Scott, why not just ask Ms. Carter directly?"

William shot Harry a sidelong glance. "Why all the chatter?"

Harry was at a loss for words, gave an awkward smile, and quickly left.

After Harry left, William rubbed his temples, Victoria's bruised face flashing in his mind.

He wondered if she was feeling any better.

William lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around his handsome features.

Daisy had just returned from visiting Victoria at the hospital and was immediately angered by William's brooding demeanor.

"You're here leisurely smoking after you and Alice have caused so much harm to Victoria!" Daisy glared at him.

William flicked the ash off his cigarette, speaking nonchalantly. "Aunt Daisy, are you my ant or hers? Why do you always side with her?"

Daisy was momentarily stunned but quickly retorted, "You brat, I'm being fair. That Alice uses her illness as an excuse to torment Victoria repeatedly, and you do nothing? You even enable her. You..."

William lazily stood up and walked to the window.

He looked down at the bustling streets below, his voice indifferent. "You know I owe her."

Daisy stomped her foot in frustration. "That's your debt, not Victoria's! You can't keep letting her hurt Victoria!"

William turned around, his gaze deep and silent for a moment before he spoke. "I know what to do. Don't worry about it."

Daisy sat down angrily. "I hope you mean what you say. If Alice targets Victoria again, I'll take Victoria to Harborview City and find her a good man! Anything is better than being your hidden mistress."

"Aunt Daisy!" William's brow furrowed, his tone growing heavier.

Daisy pouted, muttering, "Fine, fine, I give up. I won't interfere. Poor Victoria."

William's eyes flickered, but he said nothing.

Daisy sighed and continued, "I didn't just come here for Victoria. I also wanted to tell you that the Wayne family has moved back to Harborview City. You should know why."

William raised an eyebrow but said nothing.

Daisy added, "Your grandfather's health hasn't been good lately. When I visited him at the nursing home, he mentioned you and said he wanted you to visit him."

William pondered for a moment and then nodded. "Alright, I'll make time to visit soon."

Daisy smiled with relief, patting his shoulder. "William, you're not getting any younger. Think carefully about who you like and settle down soon. Don't wait until it's too late."

William lowered his eyes, hiding the unusual look in them. "Okay."

Not long after Daisy left, the phone on William's desk rang.

William pressed the answer button, and Harry's voice came through immediately. "Mr. Scott, I found out from the art association. That Samuel is actually Joshua. He sent a video of Ms. Carter painting in his studio to the judges."

William's lips tightened, his eyes darkening, his voice icy. "What about Bobby?"

Harry replied, "His awards have been revoked, and he's banned from participating in any future art association competitions."

William let out a cold laugh, his tone mocking. "That's not enough. Since Victoria's name has been cleared, have the media spread the news. Inform his school too. Victoria doesn't need a backstabbing brother like him!"

His voice carried a chilling, murderous intent that sent shivers down one's spine.

Harry quickly responded, "Yes, I'll take care of it right away."

After hanging up, Harry immediately called various media outlets.

Within half an hour, headlines like "He Steals Sister's Work and Played the Accuser," "She Drops Out to Support Family, Only to Be Betrayed by Her Brother," and "The Truth Behind Sibling Fallout" dominated the trending lists, drawing countless onlookers and going viral overnight.

Bobby walked through the school like a rat in a maze, pointed at and whispered about wherever he went.

It was a stark contrast to the glory he had basked in the day before when he returned to school with the art association's grand prize.

Furious, Bobby gritted his teeth. "That Victoria! Bitch!"

If it weren't for her, he would be the rightful rising star in the art world. How could he have fallen to this point?

He clenched his fists, cursing viciously. "You wretched woman! How dare you ruin my future! I won't let you get away with this."

He put on a hat and sunglasses, covering most of his face, and hurriedly left the school, calling Alice repeatedly, but no one answered.

In a fit of rage, he smashed his phone, cursing, "Damn woman!"

It seemed she had abandoned him!

He stormed into Nora's hospital room, smashing everything in sight.

Nora was terrified, clutching her chest and trembling. "Bobby, why are you so angry?"

Bobby's eyes were bloodshot as he glared at her. "Mom, I'm done for. It's all over!"

Nora was horrified. "What happened?"

Bobby exaggerated the story, ending with a look of despair. "Mom, the school is going to expel me, and the training team has kicked me out. What am I going to do?"

He collapsed to the floor, crying his heart out. "Mom, you have to save me!"

Nora's face turned pale as she tried to calm him. "It'll be okay. Don't worry. We'll figure something out."

Bobby grabbed her leg, looking up with tearful eyes, pleading. "Mom, we have to find Victoria. If she admits to stealing the painting, I might still have a chance!"

Nora hesitated, then her eyes lit up with a plan. "Alright, let's go find her."

###chapter 102 Victoria, I Know I Was Wrong

Victoria was packing her things to leave the hospital when Nora and Bobby blocked her way at the door.

Seeing the hostile expressions on their faces, Victoria frowned slightly, gave them a cold glance, and walked straight past them.

Bobby immediately chased after her, grabbing her by the sleeve.

Victoria stopped, shook him off in annoyance, and snapped, "Haven't you done enough to ruin my life? Get lost and don't ever bother me again."

Bobby, tears streaming down his face, wailed, "Victoria, I know I was wrong. I was out of my mind, I was stupid. Please, give me another chance."

Victoria felt a wave of nausea at his pitiful act.

She sneered, "Do you think I would believe you again? Do you take me for a fool?"

Bobby, face contorted with grief, cried even harder, "Victoria, please, just one more chance. I really know I was wrong!"

Nora joined in, crying, "Victoria, I know you think I favor Bobby, but your dad is in prison, and you've dropped out of school. Do you really want to ruin Bobby's future too?"

Victoria gave them both a cold look, her tone light and dismissive, "So, you want to force me to sacrifice myself for him again?"

Nora was at a loss for words.

Bobby quickly chimed in, "Victoria, you don't have much of a future anyway, but I do. I have a college interview coming up. Can you really bear to ruin my future now?"

He looked so desperate and pleading that anyone would feel a pang of sympathy.

Victoria smiled, seemingly in reflection, "You're right, I don't have much of a future. However, I'm definitely not going to take the blame for someone who framed me. Sorry, I'm not that noble. I can't be a hero who sacrifices herself to save others."

With that, she walked away without a second glance.

Nora suddenly lunged at her, grabbing her arm and screaming hysterically, "Victoria, if Bobby's ruined, I won't live either!"

Victoria frowned, pried her hand off forcefully, and said impatiently, "Let go of me!"

Nora refused to let go, continuing her tantrum, "You have to help Bobby! I know you hate us, but we're still your family. Are you really that heartless to let us die?"

"Family?" Victoria laughed as if she had heard a joke, "Bobby spread rumors online that I sold my body for job opportunities, stole my work to enter a competition, and then accused me of stealing his painting. It wasn't just for Alice's money, right?"

Victoria turned to Bobby with a mocking look, "Do you think that by destroying me, I'll be your puppet, painting for you?"

Bobby's face changed colors, and he stammered, "I didn't, Victoria, you misunderstood."

Victoria gave Bobby a cold look, turned, and walked quickly away. She had just taken two steps when Nora suddenly ran to the window, turning to shout at Victoria, "Victoria, if you dare to leave, I'll jump!"

Victoria froze, standing still, unable to move. She slowly turned her head, looking at Nora with a complex expression.

Victoria was stunned for a moment, then rushed over to pull her down, "Are you crazy?"

Nora took the opportunity to slap Victoria across the face, "Crazy? Bobby is my life. If you harm him, you harm me! I'm telling you, if you don't help Bobby through this crisis today, I'll jump right now!"

Blood instantly seeped from the corner of Victoria's mouth. She touched her mouth and laughed mockingly.

She had long been accustomed to Nora's unfair treatment and had long been completely disheartened, but she hadn't expected that besides kneeling to her, Nora would also threaten her life for Bobby.

Bobby, trembling in a corner, saw that Victoria wasn't moving and mustered the courage to shout at her, "Victoria, did you hear that? If you don't help me, you'll be the one who killed your own mother!"

Victoria sneered, looking at Bobby with disdain.

Bobby, feeling a chill under her gaze, continued to threaten her, "Are you going to help or not?"

Victoria looked at Nora and Bobby and suddenly laughed.

Shaking her head, she murmured, "I've never expected you to care about me or love me. I thought you at least had some conscience. But I overestimated you."

Nora and Bobby exchanged a silent glance.

Victoria continued, "For money and your own interests, you've repeatedly harmed and threatened me. I've forgiven you time and again for the sake of family, even willing to give unconditionally. I always thought you felt some guilt, even just a little. But now, you're even using your life to threaten me."

Her eyes lowered, and her eyes slightly reddened, "You really disappoint me. I wonder if I'm really your family. In that case, I'll go all out. Let's die together!"

With that, Victoria suddenly raised her eyes, revealing a look of determination. She took a deep breath and stepped onto the windowsill.

Nora's eyes turned red, and she screamed, "Victoria, do you have to be so heartless? I gave birth to you and raised you. Don't you have any mother-daughter feelings?"

"Yeah, Victoria, how can you be so cold-hearted?" Bobby echoed.

Victoria gritted her teeth, "Mother-daughter feelings? Do you remember we're mother and daughter? In your eyes, there's only money! I've had enough! I said last time, I won't be threatened by you anymore!"

Victoria cried out with all her might, as if releasing all the grievances she had endured over the years. She didn't want to compromise anymore. She wasn't a puppet; she was a person!

As she shouted in fury, she almost lost her balance and nearly fell, but she grabbed the railing just in time to steady herself.

William had just entered the hospital when he saw this scene: Victoria standing on the windowsill, seemingly about to fall at any moment.

His pupils contracted, and his heart tightened. He finally understood what it felt like to be in utter chaos.

A great panic seized his breath. William could barely control his steps as he sprinted up the stairs, rushing to the fifth floor and reaching the windowsill.

At this moment, Victoria's legs were dangling, trembling violently.

Seeing this, William's chest filled with rage, but he didn't dare to shout, fearing he would scare her.

He could only suppress his anger with all his might, speaking softly to comfort her, "Victoria, listen to me. Whatever it is, come down first."

Seeing him suddenly appear, Victoria began to cry.

###chapter 103 At Worst, I'll Die with You!

She cried, "Why are you here? I thought you hated me!"

Seeing her tears, William felt heartbroken. "Don't cry. As long as I'm here, no matter what happens, I'll be by your side."

His voice was so gentle that it made her lower her guard.

Victoria stared at him, gradually stopping her tears.

Just as she was about to speak, a sharp, piercing scream from Nora interrupted, "Victoria, don't think you can do whatever you want just because William is backing you up! If you dare leave, I'll jump from the upstairs window!"

Victoria's relaxed body tensed up again. She turned to look at Nora's twisted face, feeling a deep sense of sorrow.

William, infuriated by Nora's words, shouted coldly, "Nora, shut up!"

Nora's eyes widened in rage. "William, if it weren't for you helping her, my son wouldn't be in this mess!"

Her anger grew more intense, causing her to tremble. "Victoria, I'm asking you one last time, will you help Bobby or not?"

Victoria pressed her lips together and coldly replied, "No! If it comes to it, I'll die with you! Consider it my repayment for giving birth to me!"

William's patience was wearing thin. He grabbed Bobby, who had been watching the scene unfold, and punched him to the ground.

Caught off guard, Bobby's nose swelled up immediately.

William grabbed his collar and stomped on his face, grinding his heel in. He spoke to Nora with a murderous tone, "Nora, I warn you, if you threaten Victoria again, I'll make sure Bobby wishes he were dead!"

Bobby struggled, but William held him down firmly.

Nora watched in horror as Bobby was tortured by William. She screamed in agony, "William, you bastard! Let him go! Let go of Bobby! If you hurt him, I'll fight you to the death!"

William ignored her, tightening his grip on Bobby's neck, his face menacing.

Bobby's face turned red as he struggled to breathe, managing to choke out, "You... you..."

His legs kicked frantically, trying to break free from William's iron grip.

But William's hold was unyielding, and Bobby's efforts were in vain.

Nora, terrified, no longer dared to threaten Victoria. She crawled over to save Bobby, crying and begging, "William, please let Bobby go!"

William's face remained cold as he refused, "You shouldn't be begging me!"

Nora trembled all over, turning to Victoria and pleading, "Victoria, I'm begging you, please make him let Bobby go. I'll do anything you want!"

Seeing Nora's pitiful state, Victoria's heart softened a bit.

She took a deep breath, slowly releasing her grip on the railing and stepping back into the room. William quickly reached out to support her and simultaneously let go of Bobby.

He looked at Victoria's pale face with concern, his eyes full of pity.

Bobby lay on the ground, coughing violently and drenched in sweat.

Nora held him, slumped on the floor.

Bobby glared at William with hatred, wishing he could tear him apart.

Victoria wiped away her tears and walked over to Bobby, looking down at him with a calm gaze. "Bobby, this is the path you chose. Now, face the consequences."

"Mom, you have to help me!" Bobby pleaded with Nora, hoping she could persuade Victoria to change her mind.

Victoria shook her head and laughed, "If you can't stay here, you can go abroad! You got so much money from Ella and Alice, it's enough for you to live and study abroad!"

Bobby stared at her in disbelief, "You're kicking me out!"

His voice rose, filled with resentment and bitterness.

Victoria sneered, "What else? Let you stay here and leech off me? Bobby, I've told you before, there's nothing between us anymore!"

Bobby trembled with anger, but he knew that if Victoria didn't relent, going abroad was his best option.

But he couldn't let Victoria off so easily. He gritted his teeth and said, "Fine, I'll go abroad, but since it's expensive, you have to give me more money!"

Victoria's head buzzed with anger at his audacity.

Nora immediately chimed in, "Yes, Victoria, give Bobby more money so he can study abroad!"

Victoria snorted, "Are you crazy? I paid for your medical bills and his tuition. Do you think I'm a bank?"

"Of course you have money! Aren't you Mr. Scott's mistress? How could you not have money?" Nora retorted, ignoring William's presence.

William's face darkened, and he sternly rebuked, "Nora, don't push it!"

Nora shrank back, muttering, "I'm just telling the truth! Bobby needs a lot of money. Victoria, I promise, if you give Bobby more money, I'll never bother you again!"

Victoria found Nora's shamelessness laughable.

How could such a greedy, shameless woman be her mother?

Victoria laughed until her eyes turned red. She looked up at the ceiling, holding back her tears.

William saw her forced smile and felt a sharp pain in his heart.

He gently touched her cheek and whispered, "Don't cry, it's not worth it."

Victoria looked at his broad palm, wiped away her tears, and pulled out a card from her bag, handing it to Nora. "This is all my money. Take it and leave. From now on, I owe you nothing."

Nora eagerly took the card and stuffed it into her pocket. She helped Bobby up and didn't look back at Victoria.

Victoria stood there, watching them leave, tears streaming down her face.

Nora, Bobby, my last bit of affection for you is gone.

William pulled Victoria into his arms, gently patting her back and soothing her, "It's okay, Victoria. It's over. Don't cry."

###chapter 104 We Can Still Be Friends

Victoria leaned against William's chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. The sorrow in her heart slowly began to fade.

She looked up, her tear-streaked face meeting William's handsome features, and said earnestly, "William, thanks for helping me today. I really mean it."

If it weren't for William, she might have been pushed to the edge by Nora and Bobby!

Despite the harshness she had faced, Victoria still felt genuine gratitude.

William felt his heart soften completely.

He gently kissed her lips, tenderly and meticulously.

It wasn't until Victoria found it hard to breathe that he reluctantly let go.

With a husky voice close to her ear, William whispered, "Silly girl, you don't need to thank me."

Victoria stared blankly at his handsome face, so close to hers.

His eyes were deep and captivating, focused intently on her.

After a moment, Victoria spoke, "William, I know you care about me. Every time I'm at my lowest and most helpless, it's you who helps me."

William smiled, "As long as you know."

"But I also know you'll marry Alice. She's special to you, isn't she?" Victoria asked softly.

William's smile froze. After a moment, he replied lightly, "Yeah."

Victoria's lips pressed together, a hint of disappointment in her eyes. She sighed softly, "I can't be your mistress, but we can still be friends."

"Friends?" William scoffed, as if mocking her naivety.

"Yeah." Victoria looked at him steadily. "I know someone like me isn't qualified to be your friend..."

"What are you trying to say?" William's patience wore thin, cutting her off.

Victoria bit her lip, mustering the courage to say, "Can we end this sordid relationship? I don't want to be your hidden mistress anymore. Can I stay by your side as a friend instead?"

The room fell silent.

After a long pause, William's thin lips curved slightly as he asked, "Are you sure?"

Victoria nodded firmly, "I'm sure."

William's eyes darkened. After a long while, he slowly said, "Alright, but I have one condition."

Victoria breathed a sigh of relief and quickly nodded, "What is it?"

William's long fingers brushed her soft lips as he murmured, "I can agree to let you be my 'friend.' I can even help with your mother's medical bills and your father's debt as a 'friend.' But you have to stay with me for one more month, willingly, treating me as your 'husband.'"

"H-husband!" Victoria's eyes widened in disbelief.

William raised an eyebrow, "Not willing? Then forget it."

"No!" Victoria shook her head frantically, waving her hands, "I agree, I agree."

It's just one month, she thought. It will pass in the blink of an eye.

"Good girl." William chuckled, pecking her nose. "For this month, remember to behave. Keep your distance from other men, care for me in daily life, and satisfy me in bed."

"What?" Victoria was stunned.

"Is there a problem?" William seemed to see through her confusion, frowning slightly.

Victoria shook her head, "N-no."

William's lips curved into a mischievous smile as he leaned close to her ear, whispering, "Then you can start now."

"Start what?" Victoria blinked in confusion.

"Of course, pleasing me!" William's tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.

Victoria snapped out of her daze, her face turning bright red. She quickly waved her hands in refusal.

"We're still in the hospital, it's not appropriate," Victoria stammered.

William's Adam's apple bobbed, his husky voice filled with temptation, "Haven't we done enough in the hospital already?"

"But I'm really not in the mood right now," Victoria's voice weakened, tears still clinging to her face, making her look pitiful.

William's desire grew stronger, his gaze fixed on her luscious lips. His voice was hoarse as he said, "If you don't want to, you can use your mouth."

Victoria's mind went blank, her face turning as red as a cooked shrimp.

She pushed him away angrily, "William, you're a jerk!"

William raised an eyebrow playfully, his large hand gripping her waist, pulling her closer.

"Not willing? Then the one-month deal is off."

"No!" Victoria was terrified. She immediately relented, "I will, I will!"

William's lips curved into a smile as he sat on the couch, motioning for her to come over.

Victoria glared at him, gritting her teeth, and slowly moved towards him, leaning over his lap.

William's large hand caressed her round bottom through her pants, making Victoria shiver slightly.

He adjusted his already semi-erect member, breathing heavily, his deep voice magnetic and enticing, "Baby, hurry up."

Victoria's face turned bright red as she unzipped his pants, her pink tongue tentatively licking his erect member, the taste making her feel nauseous.

She slowly sucked, her movements clumsy, causing William to gasp, a rush of heat surging to his lower body.

Feeling his member growing larger in her mouth, Victoria panicked and pleaded, "I can't take it all!"

She covered her mouth, gagging, then looked up at William with watery eyes, "I can't."

Her eyes were red, her expression timid, making William's gaze even more intense. He pressed her head down again, his voice hoarse as he coaxed, "Good girl, just a little longer."

Victoria was forced to open her mouth wide, allowing William's member to thrust in and out roughly.

His member was hot and swollen, and Victoria endured the discomfort, trying to keep up with his rhythm, her lips moving continuously.

Finally, William let out a low growl, his member releasing, spraying a warm liquid onto Victoria's face, sliding down her neck, leaving a trail of intimacy.

###chapter 105 You Have to Treat Me as Your Husband

Victoria shot William a fierce glare and grabbed a few napkins to clean herself up.

William wrapped his arms around her from behind, pressing her head against his chest.

His chin rested on Victoria's thick, luscious hair, greedily inhaling her scent.

"Victoria, when I get back from this business trip, I'm moving in with you for the month."

Victoria's body stiffened at his words, and she instinctively turned her head. "Why?"

"Didn't I tell you? For this month, you have to treat me like your 'husband.' Did you forget?"

Victoria was stunned for a moment. "But, I..."

"Or you could quit your job and be my secretary again, like before. Then I wouldn't have to move in with you."

"No way! I will never quit my job." Victoria blurted out without thinking.

She had put so much effort into her job at Starry Studio Gallery, and she wasn't about to lose it because of William.

William let out a satisfied grunt. "Since you're not quitting, you have to follow my orders. Got it?"

Reluctantly, Victoria nodded, feeling utterly trapped.

The next day, as soon as Victoria returned to Starry Studio Gallery, Diana handed her a task.

"I'm going to Harborview City to prepare for an exhibition?" Victoria was surprised.

Diana flipped through a thick folder of documents. "Yes, this home design exhibition features the top designers in the industry. Your interior design for the Bridges family's home goods building last time was exactly what they wanted. So, Mr. Bridges specifically requested you to go to Harborview City to set up their exhibition."

Victoria bit her lip, hesitated for a moment, and then asked tentatively, "Ms. Simpson, am I going alone?"

It was her first time organizing an exhibition by herself, and she was understandably nervous about messing it up.

Diana glanced at Victoria and said nonchalantly, "What, are you scared?"

Victoria shook her head. "No, I'm just worried."

Diana put down the folder, walked to the table, took a sip of coffee, and said slowly, "I believe you can handle this job. Be confident!"

"Thank you." Victoria smiled gratefully. "I know what to do now. I'll start packing and get ready to leave."

"Good." Diana nodded. "Go ahead!"

Victoria packed her bags and sent William a message explaining the situation.

Since he was going on a business trip too, her being away for a few days wouldn't affect their arrangement.

After checking in, Victoria sat in the waiting area, bored, waiting for her flight to take off.

Suddenly, someone tapped her on the shoulder.

"Ms. Carter, what are you doing here?" A man exclaimed in surprise. "Are you going to Harborview City too?"

Victoria turned around to see Alton's beaming face.

Since they last met at Sofia's apology dinner, they hadn't been in touch. Running into him here felt surreal.

Victoria nodded and smiled. "Yes, I am."

Alton's eyes sparkled with excitement. "That's great! What class are you flying?"

"I'm just a regular worker, so it's economy class for me," Victoria laughed.

"Come on, let me upgrade you to first class. It's over two hours, and economy is so uncomfortable!" Alton grabbed Victoria's arm and led her to the VIP lounge without giving her a chance to refuse.

"No, Alton, I really can't let you spend money on me," Victoria quickly tried to stop him.

"It's no trouble. I have points, so the upgrade is free," Alton grinned. "You relax here, and I'll take care of everything."

Victoria couldn't argue with Alton and let him have his way.

In the VIP lounge, Alton eagerly brought Victoria tea, snacks, and pastries.

Victoria couldn't help but laugh. "Alton, you're being too kind. You're making me feel embarrassed."

Alton chuckled. "There's nothing to be embarrassed about. You're my dream girl."

Dream girl? Victoria coughed awkwardly.

Just as Victoria was wondering how to respond, a deep, magnetic voice with a hint of sarcasm interrupted, "Ms. Carter, you sure have a way of attracting admirers wherever you go."

Victoria froze at the sound and looked up, meeting a pair of deep, intense eyes.

William stood at the door, one hand in his pocket, the other holding a cigarette, the grayish-blue flame flickering.

Alton's expression turned serious, like a kid caught red-handed. "Mr. Scott."

William let out a cold snort, his gaze dark and stormy.

Victoria was about to explain when a petite, charming girl suddenly appeared behind William.

She wore a cream-colored cropped knit sweater and light purple skinny jeans. Her short hair was neat, her features delicate, and she had a sweet, girl-next-door look.

Harry followed her, carrying her luggage.

The girl tugged on William's sleeve and asked in a coquettish tone, "Mr. Scott, who is this lady?"

Victoria felt a shiver run down her spine, feeling utterly repulsed.

Before William could answer, Victoria quickly said, "Hello, I'm Mr. Scott's former secretary-Victoria."

"So, you're William's former secretary." The girl blinked and then smiled. "Nice to meet you, Victoria. I'm William's current secretary, Lyanna Patel."

Current secretary?

Victoria smiled lightly. "Nice to meet you."

"Ms. Carter, where are you and your friend headed?" William asked casually, his gaze sweeping over Alton.

There was a threatening and warning look in his eyes, making Alton step back silently, wishing he could disappear.

"Mr. Bridges and I just happened to run into each other here," Victoria emphasized the 'Mr. Bridges' part. "The company sent me to Harborview City to set up an exhibition."

"Really?" William raised an eyebrow. "What a coincidence. You and Mr. Bridges must have a deep connection."

Victoria could tell from his expression that William was angry again. She had sent him a message, but when she checked her phone, she realized it was still in the draft. She had forgotten to hit send.

###chapter 106 This Is an Airplane!

Victoria forced a smile, awkwardly saying, "Just a coincidence, really!"

As they chatted, the boarding announcement came over the speakers, and everyone stood up to leave.

Lyanna, like a little bunny, clung to William's sleeve as they headed to board the plane.

Seeing William leave, Alton insisted on helping Victoria with her luggage.

Unable to refuse, Victoria let him assist her.

On the plane, Victoria and Alton's seats were next to each other, while William and Lyanna sat diagonally across from them.

Lyanna, like a chirping sparrow, kept talking to William.

William listened patiently, occasionally responding with a gentle word or two.

Victoria watched their intimate interaction, a flash of disappointment crossing her eyes.

Alton, seeing William and Lyanna chatting happily, assumed William had lost interest in Victoria.

His previously abandoned thoughts of pursuing Victoria began to stir again, and he became increasingly attentive and considerate towards her.

Victoria felt awkward but couldn't bring herself to continuously reject his kindness, so she excused herself to the restroom to avoid him.

As she opened the restroom door, William's tall, imposing figure suddenly appeared. He leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, his handsome face stern.

Startled, Victoria took a step back instinctively. "William?"

"Why are you avoiding me?" William's cold gaze bore into her, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. "Afraid I'll eat you?"

Victoria frowned, whispering, "What are you doing? This is an airplane!"

"So what?"

"You..."

Before she could finish, William's long arm shot out, pinning her against the sink. His domineering kiss silenced her protests.

Victoria's eyes widened in shock as she struggled, but William didn't budge.

After a long moment, he released her, his thumb brushing her swollen lips, his gaze locking onto her flushed, angry face. "Didn't I tell you to stay away from other men?"

"I didn't!" Victoria gritted her teeth in defiance.

"Are you sure?" William's tone lifted slightly. "That Alton has been eyeing you quite eagerly."

Victoria's anger flared. "What nonsense are you spouting? We just ran into each other!"

"The truth doesn't matter." William's eyes darkened as he stared at her reddened cheeks, a smirk forming on his lips. "What matters is, I hate the way he looks at you."

"And what about you? What's with Lyanna?" Victoria retorted, her voice cold. "Ella and Alice weren't enough, now there's Lyanna too? Mr. Scott, you sure are busy!"

William chuckled at her anger, his long fingers lifting her delicate chin. "Jealous?"

"Bullshit, why would I be jealous?" Victoria turned her head, avoiding his touch.

"Really?" William laughed softly. "Then why does your tone sound so dissatisfied?"

Victoria had no response, glaring at him before attempting to leave.

William grabbed her, pressing her against the cold sink. "Try running off again."

Victoria slapped his firm arm. "Let go of me, I don't want to deal with you."

William glanced at her puffed-up face, his eyes growing darker. He leaned in closer, his voice husky. "Move again, and I won't mind getting a little intimate right here."

Victoria froze, feeling something pressing against her, disbelief in her eyes. "Are you crazy? This is an airplane."

William's lips curled into a wicked smile. "That's why I told you not to move. I can't guarantee what I'll do otherwise."

"You're a jerk," Victoria spat angrily.

"I can be worse," William's smile grew more sinister as he blew into her ear. "Guess what kind of beastly things I might do?"

Victoria's body stiffened, her breath catching.

Seeing her stop struggling, William slowly lifted her chin, explaining, "Lyanna is my uncle's friend's daughter. She's interning in her senior year, and I needed a secretary. My uncle asked me to take her on for a few months. He's family, so I couldn't refuse."

Victoria eyed him suspiciously, trying to find any hint of deceit on his handsome face.

But all she saw was calmness.

"I'm back in Harborview City because my grandfather wants to see me, and my uncle's family just moved back. I had to meet them, so I brought her along. Nothing more."

William finished, lowering his head to peck her soft lips, chuckling softly. "Victoria, whether you believe it or not, I only desire you. Other women don't interest me."

"You..."

Victoria was about to speak when the restroom door was knocked on. "What's taking so long in there? Are you done yet?"

Victoria's face turned crimson as she glared at William, flustered. "Wait, just a moment." 

Victoria quickly fixed her appearance and hurried out of the restroom.

William raised an eyebrow, amused by her hasty retreat, a smile spreading across his face.

As a passenger tried to enter, William casually stepped out, showing no sign of embarrassment, and walked away calmly.

The passenger, understanding the situation, smiled knowingly. "Young man, it's good to have passion."

William smiled back, nodding in agreement.

Victoria returned to her seat, her face still flushed. Alton immediately leaned in, concerned. "Victoria, why is your face so red?"

Victoria coughed awkwardly, mumbling, "Maybe it's too stuffy on the plane."

Alton nodded. "Planes can be quite warm."

"Yeah," Victoria replied absentmindedly.

Passing by, William suddenly chuckled, drawing both Alton and Victoria's attention.

He stood there, looking down at Victoria. "The plane's air conditioning is perfect, and there's a fresh air system. If you're feeling warm, it must be psychological."

Victoria's cheeks burned even more. She knew William was mocking her, but she couldn't argue since he was right.

William glanced at Alton. "You two chat."

With that, he walked away with long strides.

After William left, Alton looked at Victoria, worried. "Victoria, did he bother you?"

###chapter 107 Stay at the Same Hotel

Victoria shook her head. "No, but thanks for asking."

Lyanna saw them coming out of the restroom one after the other, and Victoria's face was still flushed. She immediately felt a sense of alarm.

Could it be that William, besides Ella and Alice, also had something going on with Victoria?

Feeling a bit panicked, Lyanna quickly tugged on William's sleeve. "William."

William turned his head. "What's up?"

"I..." Lyanna glanced at Victoria, then lowered her head, unsure of what to say.

"Don't overthink it. Just rest for a bit." William gently ruffled Lyanna's hair to comfort her.

"Okay." Lyanna nodded and obediently sat back in her seat, but she kept sneaking glances at William and Victoria out of the corner of her eye.

During the flight, the two didn't exchange any words.

Two hours later, the plane landed at Harborview City's international airport. As soon as the plane stopped, William received a call from Alice.

Victoria stood behind him with her bag, ready to disembark. William glanced at her and stepped aside to take the call.

"Alice."

Hearing his familiar voice, Alice immediately became excited and quickly asked, "Where are you? You didn't come home last night, and when I went to the office today, the receptionist said you were on a business trip."

"Yeah, I was just on the plane."

Alice was silent for a moment, then sighed. "You didn't tell me you were going on a business trip. I was so worried."

William paused before speaking gently, "Sorry, it was a bit rushed. I was planning to tell you after I got off the plane."

Seeing how tenderly he spoke, Victoria didn't need to hear the content to know who he was talking to.

William had a woman at home, was currently with another woman, yet he still wouldn't let go of Victoria.

Luckily, she never fantasized about being with him; otherwise, it would have been painful.

Just like Ella and Alice, each crazier than the last.

As she was lost in thought, Lyanna suddenly asked loudly, "Victoria, which hotel are you staying at?"

Her voice was so loud that it startled Victoria and was heard by Alice on the other end of the call.

"Victoria?" Alice's face instantly fell, and she questioned William, "Did you bring Victoria to Harborview City too?"

William's face darkened as he glanced at Lyanna, a hint of anger in his eyes.

Lyanna shrank back and lowered her head.

William walked off the plane quickly, explaining to Alice on the phone, "We just ran into each other."

Lyanna watched him walk ahead and hurried to follow.

Alton, seeing William leave, finally dared to speak. "Victoria, let's get off too."

Victoria nodded, and they exited the plane together.

Outside the airport, a luxury car was already waiting for Alton.

"Victoria, which hotel are you staying at? I'll give you a ride!" Alton offered warmly.

"No need to trouble you, I'll just take a cab." Victoria politely declined.

"You're my friend, and Harborview City is my hometown. It's no trouble at all. Or do you not consider me a friend?" Alton pretended to be upset, pouting.

"That's not what I meant." Victoria smiled helplessly. "I just don't want to be a bother."

"It's no bother at all," Alton insisted, gently taking her arm to guide her into the car.

"Ms. Carter, where are you headed?" A cold voice cut through the air.

Victoria turned to see William, dressed in a sharp black suit, his tie perfectly in place, exuding an air of elegance and authority.

With one hand in his pocket, he looked at Victoria with a faint, mocking smile, a hint of coldness in his eyes.

Victoria shivered involuntarily.

Alton immediately released her arm and stepped back slightly.

William's demeanor was indeed intimidating.

"I, I'm going to the hotel," Victoria managed to say.

William responded indifferently, then looked up, his tone laced with sarcasm. "Moving fast, aren't you? Already heading to the hotel together?"

"No, no, no," Alton quickly explained. "I'm just giving Ms. Carter a ride to the hotel."

William glanced at Victoria. "Is that so?"

Victoria gritted her teeth. "Yes!"

William smirked, then turned to Alton. "In that case, no need to trouble you, Mr. Bridges. Ms. Carter is staying at the same hotel as me. I'll take her."

Alton looked at Victoria, hesitated for a moment, then reluctantly agreed. "Alright."

William, not wanting to waste more words, turned to Victoria. "Let's go."

He started walking, and after a moment's hesitation, Victoria followed.

She could tell William was angry. Defying him now would only lead to trouble. It was better to go along with him and avoid future issues.

They got into the Lincoln Town Car that had come to pick up William. Harry sat in the front seat, and Lyanna, seeing Victoria, was surprised. "Ms. Carter, are you coming with us?"

Victoria forced a smile, trying to think of a response, when she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her waist. She turned to glare at William.

He had sneakily slipped his hand under her shirt and pinched her!

William raised an eyebrow, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.

Victoria clenched her teeth, suppressing her anger, and glared at William before turning back to Lyanna. "I'm staying at the same hotel as you. Mr. Scott kindly offered me a ride."

Lyanna blinked, looking between Victoria and William, then nodded suspiciously.

The car fell silent. Harry glanced at Lyanna and Victoria through the rearview mirror, his lips twitching. He silently cursed William for being shameless.

Victoria kept her head down, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.

William didn't make things difficult for her and didn't speak to her during the ride.

Each lost in their own thoughts, they soon arrived at the hotel.

William got out, glanced at Victoria, and then walked toward the hotel entrance.

Victoria understood his look and, thinking of their one-month agreement, reluctantly followed.

Lyanna watched their backs with displeasure.

At the front desk, Lyanna smiled and said, "Ms. Carter, this place isn't cheap. Your company must be generous to book you a room here." 

###chapter 108 Be Good and Take a Bath with Me

Victoria forced a smile at the comment but didn't respond.

After checking in, she looked around her luxurious room. Since Alvin's accident, she hadn't stayed in such a nice hotel.

The room had spacious, bright floor-to-ceiling windows, a massage bathtub, a leather sofa, and a large, soft waterbed.

Victoria rolled around on the bed, feeling incredibly comfortable.

She filled the bathtub with water, scattered the petals provided by the hotel, turned on some music, and finally slipped into the tub, closing her eyes to enjoy the rare moment of relaxation.

Suddenly, she felt the water ripple beside her, and a cold body pressed against her.

She opened her eyes abruptly and saw a pair of deep, dark eyes staring back at her.

"William? What are you doing here?"

William leisurely took off his jacket and sweater, revealing his strong, muscular chest.

"What, am I not welcome here?" he asked, raising an eyebrow, his long fingers trailing along her neck and chest.

Victoria felt flustered by his touch and shrank back into the water. "Of course not." As soon as she spoke, she found herself spun around, her body pressed against the side of the tub by William.

His tall, muscular frame was right next to her, his hot breath on her ear.

A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips.

Victoria's body stiffened, and she struggled slightly, only to be held tighter.

"Don't move!" His voice was low and sexy. "Be good and take a bath with me."

With that, he guided her right hand down to touch his hard, hot erection, making Victoria's face flush with embarrassment.

William looked at her, his Adam's apple bobbing, and kissed her forehead before grabbing the body wash to lather her up.

The warm, slippery sensation made Victoria shiver.

William's large hands felt like they were on fire.

She squirmed, unsure of what to do, which only made him more aggressive. She finally let out a soft whimper, almost begging.

William's eyes grew darker, his deep, magnetic voice barely restrained.

"Call me 'honey.'" He commanded.

Victoria stared at him, stunned.

William frowned slightly. "Or you will see what happens!"

A dangerous glint appeared in his eyes, and Victoria quickly fell silent.

After a moment, she softly said, "Honey."

William nodded in satisfaction and continued washing her, the soft bath sponge covered in bubbles, rubbing against her delicate skin, causing her to shiver.

As he washed her, he teased her with his fingers, the sensation so ticklish that Victoria couldn't help but squeeze her legs together.

She let out a soft moan, her voice sweet and lingering.

William chuckled lowly, dipping his finger in the body wash, and slid his hand between her legs, easily finding her tight, sensitive spot, gently rubbing it, making Victoria moan.

"Victoria, does it feel good?" he asked teasingly, his voice seductive.

Victoria's mind went blank, her cheeks flushed, her eyes watery and captivating.

"Yes, it feels good," she stammered.

William smirked, quickening his pace.

Victoria was almost out of breath from his teasing, but the pleasure coursing through her body made her crave more.

She let out a muffled groan.

William glanced at her flushed, alluring face, his throat tightening, and he spoke in a rough voice, "Victoria, do you want to feel even better?"

His deep voice was filled with intense desire, like a catalyst, making Victoria feel lightheaded.

Biting her lip, she nodded shyly.

William's eyes darkened, and he leaned closer to Victoria, his voice low, "Then enjoy it."

Before Victoria could react, he lifted her legs around his waist and slowly entered her wet, eager body, expertly finding her sensitive spot.

In an instant, every pore in her body opened up, and Victoria arched her back, her face full of longing.

Seeing her desperate expression, William's lips curled into a playful smile.

He pulled out and entered again, slowly thrusting.

Victoria couldn't help but moan.

His movements were just right, each thrust hitting her most sensitive spot, making her squirm as if trying to merge with him.

William's eyes grew darker, and his grip tightened.

Victoria's body convulsed with pleasure, her arms wrapped around his neck, her legs tightly around his lean waist.

She couldn't control her screams, her voice sweet and seductive, making William's blood boil, his movements becoming more frantic and urgent, as if he wanted to devour her.

Victoria was left weak and dazed, clinging to his shoulders, letting him have his way.

After a while, Victoria collapsed in his arms.

But William's erection was still inside her, feeling the foreign object connecting them, Victoria couldn't help but protest, "Get out."

William didn't respond, tightening his arm around her waist, his lips brushing her ear, "Move again, and I promise you won't be able to get out of bed tonight."

Victoria froze, not daring to move.

Seeing her finally calm down, William slowly pulled out, and Victoria sighed in relief.

William smiled at her, "I helped you with your bath. Aren't you going to help me with mine?"

His tone was teasing, making Victoria's face turn bright red.

William's lips curled into a wicked smile, and he pinched her earlobe, "Victoria, help me."

His voice was low and husky, almost hypnotic, tempting her.

Victoria swallowed hard and picked up the bath sponge, lathering it with body wash to clean him.

Even though they had done this many times, Victoria had never looked at his body so closely.

William was perfect!

His body was incredible, with firm, even muscles, a tight eight-pack, and a perfectly shaped, firm butt. Even though his erection had subsided, it was still intimidating, exuding a powerful masculine charm.

Victoria glanced at his penis and quickly looked away.

It was too much.

Victoria forced herself to focus, carefully washing him.

William enjoyed her attention, a faint smile on his lips.

As they were busy, there was a sudden knock on the door.

###chapter 109 Are You Jealous?

"Ms. Carter." Lyanna's voice cut through the room.

Victoria froze, her face turning awkward.

William frowned. What did Lyanna want now?

Outside the door, Lyanna, puzzled by the silence, raised her voice a bit. "Ms. Carter, you there?"

Victoria pressed her lips together, glanced at William, and called out, "Yeah, I'm here. What's up?"

Ignoring William's darkening expression, she answered while getting dressed.

"Ms. Carter, could you open the door?" Lyanna asked politely.

Victoria hesitated for a moment, then walked over and opened the door.

Lyanna looked surprised to see Victoria standing there in bathrobe.

"I was just taking a shower," Victoria explained, noticing Lyanna's gaze lingering on her neck. She quickly covered it, a hint of panic on her face.

Lyanna awkwardly looked away.

"I was just wondering if you've seen William. He's not in his room, and I can't reach him by phone," Lyanna said, glancing around the room but seeing nothing.

Victoria stammered, then feigned ignorance. "I don't know. Maybe Mr. Scott had something to take care of."

A flash of disdain crossed Lyanna's eyes as she looked at Victoria. Her tone turned harsh. "Ms. Carter, you're just William's former secretary. You should keep your distance from him. Not everyone can cling to William."

Victoria's expression turned cold.

"How I interact with Mr. Scott is our business, not yours!" She shot Lyanna a frosty look and slammed the door shut.

Lyanna clenched her fists in anger as she stared at the closed door.

'Damn Victoria, how dare you disrespect me like that!' she cursed under her breath.

Lyanna stomped her foot in frustration and ran off.

As soon as Victoria closed the door, William pinned her against it.

"Ms. Carter, you're quite bold!" He lifted her chin, his gaze intense.

Victoria pouted, displeased. "You know she likes you. Why do you keep her around?"

"She likes me?" William sneered. "Lots of people like me. I'm only tolerating her because of my uncle."

"Well, you sure tolerate a lot of women," Victoria muttered.

William found her disgruntled tone amusing.

He pinched her cheek and laughed. "Are you jealous?"

Victoria swatted his hand away, scoffing. "Jealous? Are you kidding?"

She was just a mistress he paid for. She had no right to be jealous of the women around William.

William's eyes narrowed dangerously as he stared at her.

Victoria felt a bit scared under his gaze and took a step back.

She nervously adjusted her collar and asked cautiously, "Mr. Scott, do you have any other instructions?"

William didn't respond, just continued to look at her with an unreadable expression.

After a long moment, he suddenly bent down and scooped her up.

Victoria screamed in surprise as he tossed her onto the bed.

The next moment, he was all over her, kissing her face, neck, and collarbone.

By the time William was done, Victoria's body was covered in hickeys, her skin flushed, looking particularly enticing.

William bit her ear gently. "Now do you see how powerful I am?"

Victoria's face was flushed, her eyes slightly red. She glared at him. "Jerk!"

William laughed, a low chuckle. "Jerk?" He traced her face with his long fingers. "Well, I'll take that as a compliment."

Victoria grabbed his hand, wary, as if facing a great enemy.

William found it amusing, kissed her on the cheek, and got out of bed. "Hungry? Let's grab a bite."

Victoria was indeed starving. She sat on the edge of the bed for a moment before getting up to change and put on makeup to cover the marks on her neck.

William watched her busy figure, his gaze deepening.

Downstairs in the restaurant, Harry and Lyanna were already dining. When they saw the two of them come down, they immediately approached.

Victoria felt Lyanna's intense gaze as soon as she sat down at the table. She frowned.

Lyanna glanced at Victoria with a look of disdain.

Victoria felt a surge of irritation.

William gave Lyanna a brief glance before sitting down and sipping the soup in front of him.

"William, where did you go?" Lyanna asked sweetly.

William put down his spoon. "Had some business to take care of."

"Then how did you run into Ms. Carter?" Lyanna asked tentatively. She had been shocked to see Victoria with him earlier.

Victoria's heart skipped a beat. She looked at William, who was calmly drinking his soup, showing no intention of responding.

Victoria quickly answered, "It was an old client. Mr. Scott asked me to come along."

Lyanna's eyes darted around, then she smiled. "But Ms. Carter, you've resigned. It's more appropriate for me to handle such matters since I'm William's secretary now."

Her words were clearly laced with hostility.

William set down his spoon and looked at Lyanna coldly. "Do I need your permission to decide who accompanies me?"

His tone was calm but carried a strong sense of authority.

Lyanna's body trembled, and she lowered her head. "I didn't mean it that way."

William smirked. "If that's the case, then stay quiet."

Though his words were light, they carried an undeniable command. Lyanna bit her lip, tears welling up but held back due to the setting.

She hated Victoria! Why did William always side with her?

Victoria initially thought William was too harsh on Lyanna, but seeing Lyanna's hateful glare, she felt she deserved it.

It wasn't Victoria who was being harsh. If Lyanna wanted to blame someone, it should be William, not her. It was absurd!

Lyanna ate a few bites of her meal, then excused herself, glaring at Victoria one last time before leaving.

Victoria pretended not to notice and continued eating.

The dinner was lavish, with a variety of dishes, but Victoria had no appetite.

William ate gracefully, his movements slow and deliberate, making him a pleasure to watch.

Victoria couldn't help but steal a few glances, finding him more and more handsome.

"Have you seen enough?" William suddenly stopped eating and looked at her.

Victoria quickly averted her gaze, shoveling a few bites of food into her mouth. "I don't know what you're talking about."

William's smile grew more mischievous.

As they ate, a woman at a nearby table suddenly exclaimed, "It's snowing!"

###chapter 110 My Wish Is Impossible to Fulfill

Victoria gazed out the window, and sure enough, she saw snowflakes drifting down, swirling beautifully.

Watching the snowflakes dance, Victoria was momentarily stunned. Suddenly, she remembered it was snowing the day Alvin was arrested.

In the blink of an eye, Alvin had already been in prison for two years.

Time flies so fast, and Christmas was just a month away.

Victoria's nose tingled with a hint of sadness.

William noticed the subtle change in Victoria's expression, his eyes flickering thoughtfully.

He then stood up, pulled Victoria from her seat, and helped her into a thick coat and scarf. "Come on, let's go for a walk."

Victoria was taken aback, not understanding why William suddenly wanted to go for a walk tonight.

She nodded and followed William outside.

The night wind blew, messing up Victoria's hair.

The dim streetlights illuminated their clasped hands.

Victoria's hand was cold and soft, but touching it brought a sense of warmth.

William tightened his grip on her hand, walking forward with steady steps, not looking back.

They walked side by side, William glancing at her. She walked with her head down like a docile little kitten, her long eyelashes covering her eyes.

William suddenly laughed, his laughter filled with joy.

Victoria looked up at him in confusion. "What are you laughing at?"

William chuckled and ruffled her hair. "Nothing."

He seemed to be in a very good mood.

Victoria blinked and didn't ask further.

This moment was too beautiful, so beautiful that it made one forget the passage of time.

She didn't want to break it.

Colorful lights twinkled, and the surroundings were filled with a strong Christmas atmosphere. The store windows were adorned with vibrant decorations.

They walked side by side on the wide street, a thin layer of snow underfoot, making a rhythmic crunching sound.

Walking in the cold wind, Victoria couldn't help but shiver. William considerately took off his coat and draped it over her shoulders.

"Put it on," he said softly.

Victoria shook her head. "It's okay."

William frowned slightly and forcefully wrapped the coat around her, his tone leaving no room for refusal. "You must wear it!"

His tone was so domineering that Victoria eventually gave in, letting William wrap the coat around her.

They continued walking. When they passed a coffee shop, Victoria stopped.

It seemed like a long time since she had enjoyed her time in a café. The last time was back in college when she still had a bright future ahead.

William followed Victoria's gaze to the coffee shop and said lightly, "Want to go in?"

Victoria hesitated for a moment but couldn't resist her inner desire. "Okay, thank you."

They entered the shop, which was quite crowded. Many people were holding steaming cups of coffee, enjoying the warmth.

Victoria ordered two lattes and pushed one in front of William. "You should try it. It's really good."

William glanced at her, then picked up the straw and took a sip.

After tasting it, he stared at her with a complex expression for a few seconds before finally speaking. "It's too sweet."

Victoria was momentarily speechless and silently sipped her latte.

Holding their warm lattes, they continued strolling and arrived at a square where a giant Christmas tree was set up, adorned with exquisite lights, shining brightly under the falling snow.

Victoria was captivated and couldn't help but look at it a few more times.

William took the opportunity to wrap his arm around Victoria's shoulders, leaning close to her ear. "Christmas is coming soon. If you have any wishes, just tell me. This year, I'll be your Santa Claus."

Victoria's heart skipped a beat, and she looked up at him in surprise. "You want to grant my wish?"

"Yes," William said with a gentle smile.

Victoria bit her lip, sighed, and smiled bitterly. "My wish is impossible to fulfill."

"Is there a wish I can't fulfill?" William raised an eyebrow.

Victoria smiled but didn't say anything.

"Tell me," William urged with interest.

Victoria hesitated for a moment but finally mustered the courage to voice her wish. "I wish my dad could be released from prison so our family could spend Christmas together."

William fell silent after hearing this.

Victoria knew this wish was difficult to achieve. Seeing William's silence, she didn't press further.

The mood between them grew quiet.

The snow fell heavier, and William hailed a cab, taking Victoria back to the hotel. They went to their respective rooms.

William didn't come to see her again.

Victoria knew that her relationship with William couldn't be exposed.

It was impossible that William didn't have any feelings for her.

But they both knew that the gap between them was too wide, with too many issues beyond just their family backgrounds.

William maintained a physical relationship with her, helped her pay off debts, covered Nora's medical bills, and protected her when she was in trouble. But he would never publicly acknowledge her as his girlfriend.

Victoria could never become his wife.

William might like her, but that affection hadn't reached the level of love, let alone the point where he couldn't live without her.

Their current warmth or intimacy was fleeting; they had no future together.

The next day, Victoria checked out of the hotel and moved to the one arranged by Starry Studio Gallery.

Although it was much less luxurious than the one William had booked, at least she could stay there quietly without so many worries.

Victoria stood in the center of the exhibition hall, her heart surging with excitement.

It was empty now, waiting to be transformed into a creative and cozy home display area by her.

She took a deep breath and prepared to start her layout work.

Victoria sketched her initial ideas on the blueprint. She envisioned an open-plan living and dining area to showcase the fluidity and flexibility of modern home design.

As she focused on marking the blueprint, Alton arrived.

The exhibition was hosted by the Bridges Group, and Alton, as the heir to the Bridges family, was naturally involved.

Seeing Victoria, he smiled warmly. "Victoria, are you working on the design?"

Victoria put down her pen and nodded politely. "Yes."

Alton walked over, his gaze falling on the design draft on the table. He smiled and praised, "It looks great. As expected of Joshua's student."

"You're too kind," Victoria said modestly.

Victoria began directing the staff to move in the furniture and arrange it according to her design. Alton helped out on the side.

After finishing all the work, Victoria breathed a sigh of relief, stretched, and looked at the clock on the wall. It was already 8:30 PM.

Seeing the fatigue on her face, Alton smiled and said, "You must be exhausted. Let me take you back to rest."

###chapter 111 Why Are You Here?

Victoria wanted to refuse, but she felt so sore and weak that she agreed.

She got into Alton's car, which was warm inside. Victoria leaned back in the seat and closed her eyes, pretending to nap.

Alton glanced at Victoria through the rearview mirror. She seemed asleep with a faint smile, looking serene and charming.

He turned his attention back to the road and drove towards the hotel.

The hotel was only a ten-minute drive from the exhibition center. Before long, Alton's car pulled up in front of the hotel.

He turned to look at the still-sleeping Victoria and gently called, "Victoria, wake up. We're here."

Hearing this, Victoria opened her eyes, rubbed her throbbing forehead, and prepared to get out of the car.

Just then, her phone rang. The caller ID showed it was William.

She swiped to answer.

"Where are you?" William's voice was cold.

"At the hotel," Victoria replied honestly.

"Who are you with?" His tone was low, with a hint of anger.

Victoria frowned, disliking his aggressive attitude, but given their current relationship, she patiently explained, "A colleague."

"Male or female?"

"Female," Victoria lied quietly, turning away.

The call ended abruptly.

Victoria held the phone, stunned for a moment, then snapped out of it and smiled apologetically at Alton as she prepared to get out of the car.

Alton, ever the gentleman, opened the car door and helped her out.

"Thanks," Victoria said, taking a step forward when suddenly, someone grabbed her arm, pulling her back.

Startled, she didn't have time to react before she was enveloped in William's embrace, his firm chest pressing against her, his unique scent filling her nose.

"What are you doing here?" Victoria looked up at William, her almond-shaped eyes wide with surprise.

She felt the heat radiating from William, transferring through their contact, making her whole body tense.

"If I hadn't come, would you have run off with another man?" William's voice was low and hoarse, filled with restraint.

Victoria blinked her wet eyes, looking innocent. "I wouldn't."

Alton, also startled by William's sudden appearance, quickly greeted, "Mr. Scott!"

William shot him a cold glance. "Aren't you leaving?"

Alton awkwardly cleared his throat, touched his nose, and wisely stepped aside, waving to Victoria. "I'm leaving now."

With that, he quickly got into his car and drove off.

Only after Alton's car disappeared did William shift his gaze back to Victoria.

His eyes were like magnets, making Victoria feel like she was being roasted. She struggled to break free. "William, can you let go of me?"

He didn't budge, holding her tightly, his tone lazy. "No."

Victoria frowned, trying to reason. "Alton's gone."

"So what? It doesn't concern us, does it?"

"But..."

William's gaze turned menacing, his voice icy. "Didn't you say you were with a female colleague?"

Victoria fell silent, feeling a chill. Now she wished she could slap herself for lying.

Victoria looked up, timidly explaining, "I was just afraid you'd be mad."

William snorted, his expression softening a bit. "Victoria, do you really not know what Alton's intentions are?"

Victoria was taken aback, then nodded. "He did pursue me, but I clearly rejected him. Now we're just colleagues!"

As soon as she finished speaking, William kissed her hard, silencing her.

After a long time, William finally let her go.

His lips were red from the kiss, his eyes deep, burning with anger.

"I've told you many times to stay away from other men. Are you ignoring me?"

Victoria bit her lip, stubbornly replying, "I'm not. Do you expect me to limit my work interactions? William, we only have a one-month deal. Don't you think you're overstepping?"

"Say that again." His tone dropped to freezing.

Victoria pressed her lips together, meeting his gaze without fear.

William stared at her for a long time before finally giving in. He grabbed her chin, speaking harshly. "Don't let me catch you getting close to other men again, or else..."

"I'm hungry!" Victoria suddenly interrupted.

William stared at her, saying nothing.

Victoria continued, "I'm starving."

Her pleading look made it impossible for William to stay angry. He finally relented.

He took out his phone, made a quick call, and then hung up.

"Come with me."

He turned and walked ahead, his long strides quickly putting distance between them. When he noticed Victoria wasn't following, he stopped and waited.

Victoria pointed to her legs, looking pitiful. "I'm too tired to walk."

William frowned, walked back to her, and crouched down. "Get on. I'll carry you."

His back was broad and strong, exuding a sense of security.

Victoria hesitated for a moment before slowly climbing on, wrapping her arms around his neck.

William stood up, supporting her, and strode forward.

Victoria clung to his back, inhaling his scent, feeling reluctant to let go.

His body was much warmer than hers, with a faint smell of tobacco mixed with the sweet scent of his body wash.

"Victoria, if you keep moving, I'll throw you off," he threatened.

"Okay." Victoria obediently stayed still, lying quietly on his back.

William's lips curved into a smile.

Victoria, resting on his shoulder, could feel her breath on his face, tickling him.

She couldn't resist touching his smooth, firm cheek.

William raised an eyebrow, his voice cold. "Victoria, what are you doing?"

"Nothing." Victoria quickly withdrew her hand, staying silent.

William, seeing her guilty look, didn't pursue it further and continued walking.

They remained silent until they reached the restaurant. William gently set Victoria down.

A waiter approached.

"Welcome! Do you have a reservation?" the waiter asked respectfully.

"Yes, a window seat on the third floor," William replied coolly, then led her towards the stairs.

###chapter 112 The Way He Looked at Me Was Unsettling

Victoria followed him, sneaking glances at the decor around her.

The restaurant wasn't extravagantly luxurious, but it had a unique charm. The rustic elegance made it feel particularly cozy.

She couldn't help but think to herself that the designer of this place must have great taste.

Victoria sat down.

William didn't stand on ceremony either, pulling out a chair and sitting next to her.

The waiter quickly brought out the dishes, which looked and smelled amazing, making her mouth water.

Victoria looked at the exquisite dishes on the table and swallowed hard.

"Go ahead and eat."

Victoria nodded, picking up her utensils to start, but she paused mid-air, looking at William in confusion. "Aren't you eating?"

He glanced at her. "I've already eaten. Don't worry about me."

Victoria pouted and started eating. Her stomach was growling with hunger.

William watched her devour the food and couldn't help but chuckle. He picked up his wine glass and took a sip.

His gaze drifted to the window, and he suddenly noticed a familiar figure downstairs. His eyes locked onto the person through the crowd.

The person seemed to notice his gaze and smiled at him.

William nodded and smiled back, raising his wine glass in a greeting.

The person said something to their companion and then entered the restaurant.

Victoria, focused on her food, missed the entire exchange.

After she was full, Victoria planned to leave.

As soon as she stood up, William pulled her back down to sit beside him.

He took a napkin and gently wiped the corner of her mouth, whispering, "No rush."

A moment later, there was a soft knock on the door of their private room. A middle-aged man walked in, looking friendly in his well-tailored suit, with a sharp glint in his eyes.

"William! What a surprise to see you here!" Wayne's voice was loud and warm.

He walked over, patting William on the shoulder with a kind smile.

"Uncle Wayne, long time no see." William nodded politely.

"Indeed, it's been a while." Wayne looked William over, nodding in approval. "I heard your media and advertising company is doing exceptionally well. You must be a business genius!"

"You're too kind, Uncle Wayne," William replied modestly.

Victoria stayed silent, listening to their conversation.

William's uncle? So it was Wayne Scott, the current chairman of Infinity Unity Group, the most powerful company under the Scott family.

"William, who is this?" Wayne finally noticed Victoria, scrutinizing her for a moment.

William glanced at Victoria. "My former secretary."

"Really? A secretary?" Wayne was surprised for a moment, then laughed heartily. "You sure know how to have fun."

Victoria awkwardly forced a smile. Could she pretend she hadn't heard that?

"What brings you here today, Uncle Wayne?" William asked.

"I just got back to the country and arranged a dinner with some friends, so I came here. Didn't expect to run into you." Wayne smiled warmly.

Wayne looked at William with affection. "Your grandfather has been asking about you. When will you visit him at the nursing home?"

"I was planning to go today, but something came up. I'll go tomorrow."

Wayne nodded in satisfaction. "Good, make sure to go early so he doesn't get upset waiting."

"Got it."

After a few more words, Wayne left.

His assistant was waiting outside. Seeing Wayne come out, he quickly approached. "Mr. Scott."

"Look into that woman," Wayne whispered with a serious expression.

"Yes, sir," the assistant replied, following Wayne out.

As soon as he left, Victoria let out a sigh of relief, finally feeling free.

William glanced at her. "Are you afraid of my uncle?"

Victoria shook her head. "Not exactly afraid, but the way he looked at me was unsettling."

"Why do you say that?"

Victoria shrugged, looking uneasy. "I don't know how to describe it. He was smiling at you, but it gave me a creepy feeling, like something sinister."

William seemed thoughtful, his gaze deepening.

"William?" Victoria called out, puzzled.

"It's nothing," William replied, snapping out of his thoughts. "Since we're done eating, let's go."

"The hotel I'm staying at is nearby. I can go back on my own."

"Let me take you back," William said.

"Isn't that inconvenient?" Victoria hesitated.

"What's inconvenient?" William chuckled. "What, are you afraid I'll try something?"

Victoria glared at him. "Who knows? You might."

"Really?" William leaned in closer, his warm breath brushing against her face, making her cheeks flush.

He bent down, his nose almost touching hers, the air between them charged with tension.

Her heart raced, and she couldn't meet his gaze. He was too close, and she couldn't escape. Their lips brushed.

She stared at him, her face turning a deep shade of red, looking stunning.

He smiled, his voice husky and teasing. "Since you think so, should we give it a try?"

His warm breath tickled her face, sending shivers down her spine.

Victoria pushed against his chest, moving back a bit, watching him warily.

William laughed softly at her tense expression. "Just kidding."

He ruffled her hair affectionately. "Silly girl, let's go. I'll take you back."

Victoria bit her lip, looking at him with a mix of frustration and resignation.

William, seeing her expression, sighed and took her hand, leading her out.

The hotel was just a few minutes away. When they reached her room, William showed no intention of leaving.

Victoria glared at him. "Why aren't you leaving?"

William looked down at her, his eyes twinkling with mischief. "Do you want me to leave?"

"Of course I do." She was exhausted and didn't want to deal with him any longer. She had work tomorrow.

"If you want me to leave, then I won't."

Victoria was stunned. Was he really being this stubborn?

"I don't care. I'm staying here tonight." With that, he opened the door, lay down on the soft bed, and closed his eyes.

Victoria was at a loss for words. Could William be any more shameless?

She had no choice but to give in.

She sighed. "Fine, you win."

She tossed her bag on the couch and headed to the bathroom. "I'm taking a shower."

Hearing the bathroom door close, William opened his eyes, a satisfied smile playing on his lips, his eyes filled with joy.

###chapter 113 She Doesn't Like This Feeling

After her shower, Victoria slipped into her pajamas and stepped out. She glanced at William, who was sprawling on the bed in the living room, and pursed her lips.

"I'm crashing on the couch," she said, turning away without waiting for a reply.

William got up and headed for his own shower. When he came back out in a bathrobe, he saw Victoria on the couch, looking like she'd passed out from sheer exhaustion.

He walked over quietly, his fingers gently brushing her smooth skin, lingering for a moment.

Victoria's eyelashes fluttered as she sensed someone near. She slowly opened her eyes to see William's handsome face.

"Go sleep on the bed. I promise I won't try anything," William said, his gaze soft and a slight smile on his lips.

Victoria eyed him skeptically, hesitating.

William's smile grew. "Come on, it's more comfortable."

Still unsure, Victoria knew William's promises in these situations were often unreliable. What if he tried something while she was asleep?

William didn't push, just watched her with that same smile.

After a long pause, Victoria swallowed hard and slowly moved to the bed.

As soon as she lay down, a long arm wrapped around her waist. The strong scent of his cologne filled her nostrils, and his warm breath sent shivers through her, making her heart race.

Victoria lay stiffly, not daring to move, feeling the heat from his touch on her back. She gritted her teeth and growled, "William, don't even think about it!"

"Okay," he murmured, his voice restrained but compliant, not moving any closer.

Victoria sighed in relief and turned her back to him.

She thought she wouldn't be able to sleep, but soon, exhaustion took over, and she gradually closed her eyes.

William held her close, his chin resting against her neck, inhaling her scent as he drifted off.

The next morning

When William woke up, Victoria was still asleep. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a serene glow on her delicate profile, making it hard to look away.

He watched her, a slight smile playing on his lips, feeling unusually content.

Victoria woke up groggily, her eyes meeting William's deep gaze. His intense stare made her feel exposed.

William propped his head on one hand, lazily gazing at her.

His features were sharp and refined, even in a casual pose, he looked dazzlingly handsome.

He had a playful and teasing smile as he looked at Victoria.

Victoria sat up abruptly, her face flushed.

William couldn't help but laugh, his eyes full of amusement. "Morning."

"Good, good morning," Victoria stammered, turning her head away awkwardly.

For some reason, she felt more uncomfortable with this intimate, non-sexual closeness than with physical intimacy. It made them seem like a loving couple rather than something more secretive.

She felt it just wasn't meant for her, and she didn't like this feeling.

"Not getting up? Expecting something?" William raised an eyebrow, his eyes twinkling with mischief.

Victoria looked up, glaring at him before quickly lowering her gaze, muttering, "I'm not like you, ready to get frisky anytime, anywhere."

William laughed, flipping over to pin her beneath him.

Victoria panicked, struggling instinctively. "What are you doing? I haven't brushed my teeth, it's gross."

William laughed harder. "It's fine, I don't mind."

With that, he kissed her soft lips.

Victoria was stunned, momentarily forgetting to push him away.

After a long while, he reluctantly let her go, his voice hoarse. "If you don't get up, I can't promise I won't do something frisky."

Victoria felt something hard pressing against her, her face turning red with embarrassment and anger. She glared at him, pushed him away, and ran to the bathroom.

With a loud bang, she slammed the door shut.

William shook his head with a smile, feeling a strange emotion rising in his heart.

He suddenly thought that if life could always be like this, it wouldn't be so bad.

After breakfast at the hotel restaurant, William drove Victoria to the exhibition center before heading to the nursing home.

William's grandfather, Garth Scott, lived in a nursing home in the suburbs. It was spacious, elegant, and quiet, with top-notch facilities, perfect for recuperation.

When William arrived, Garth was exercising in the yard.

Seeing William, Garth's face turned cold, and he ignored him.

William didn't mind, standing quietly by.

When Garth finished exercising, William stepped forward.

Garth glanced at him, his tone unfriendly. "You've been gone so long, do you even remember you have a grandfather?"

William responded indifferently, "The company has been busy."

Garth sneered, clearly not believing him. "Busy dating your girlfriend?"

William remained silent.

Seeing his admission, Garth's anger flared. He struck the ground with his cane, shouting, "I didn't agree with you marrying Ella from the Garcia family. What are they compared to the Scott family?"

William frowned, patiently explaining, "Grandpa, the Garcia family is a prestigious family in Silvermist City. Marrying them is mutually beneficial."

"Mutually beneficial? They're just upstarts," Garth scoffed, disdainful. "But you're no better, canceling the wedding at the last minute, making both families a laughingstock. You embarrassed me in front of my old friends."

William said nothing.

Garth grew angrier, raising his cane to strike William.

William didn't dodge, letting the cane hit his leg.

Seeing William not avoiding, Garth hesitated, retracting his cane. He looked at William's stubborn, pain-enduring face, a hint of softness in his eyes. "You're still so foolish."

William pressed his lips together. "I was wrong, I shamed the Scott family."

"Enough," Garth sighed, shaking his head. "But if you canceled the wedding, why are you entangled with Alice Garcia, causing such a scandal? Your actions are inappropriate."

William frowned. "Grandpa, you know she suffered greatly for me. I wanted to marry Ella for her sake. Now that she's back, I must marry her."

Garth pondered, seemingly considering.

"Fine, I can't control you young people. Decide for yourself," Garth said, waving his hand tiredly. "But besides these sisters, I heard you keep a woman named Victoria?"

###chapter 114 Chance Encounter

William's eyes narrowed at the words. "Grandpa, where'd you hear about this?" he asked, frowning.

"Doesn't matter where I heard it. A guy being a bit of a playboy is no big deal, but this woman is Alvin's daughter," Garth said seriously. "Have you forgotten how your parents died?"

At the mention of his parents, William's fists clenched. After a moment, he spoke, "Grandpa, don't worry. I'm only doing this to get back at Alvin."

"I hope that's the case," Garth said, squinting slightly. "My health's getting worse, and I don't know how much longer I have. When are you coming back from Silvermist City?"

William thought for a moment before replying slowly, "New media is advancing rapidly. Silvermist City, as the economic hub of the country, has a lot of potential. Once things settle here, I'll consider other options."

Garth was moved by William's words. He patted William's shoulder excitedly and praised, "That's my grandson, always ambitious."

William smiled and then changed the subject, asking about Garth's health.

"Don't worry about me. I'm as strong as ever. You don't need to worry," Garth replied with a hearty laugh.

William spent the entire day at the nursing home, taking care of Garth.

Once the furniture was in place, Victoria started working on the soft furnishings.

She picked out some soft-colored throw pillows and blankets, and some modern art pieces to hang on the walls.

Besides these soft furnishings, lighting was crucial to the success of the exhibition.

She bought various types of light bulbs to test and see which worked best.

The workload was enormous, and she was exhausted every night.

But thanks to her efforts, the lighting setup in the entire exhibition hall was completely transformed.

During the final adjustment phase, Victoria worked at the exhibition hall during the day and holed up in her hotel room at night, drawing design plans and looking for areas to improve.

William hadn't contacted her in the past few days. While Victoria felt a sense of relief, she also felt a bit lost.

She understood that to William, she was just a temporary fling.

Once they returned to Silvermist City, everything would go back to the way it was.

So, although she felt a bit disappointed that he hadn't contacted her, she wasn't heartbroken.

Victoria gathered her things and decided to go shopping.

Most of the exhibition hall's setup was complete, and she wanted to buy some gifts for Wendy, Elara, and Samuel.

Last time, during the art association incident, Samuel had helped clear her name, and her award was reissued. She had to thank him properly.

Harborview City's malls were bustling and lively, filled with crowds. Victoria weaved through the shops.

She bought some pastries and small accessories first, then went to a skincare store to buy sets for her friends.

Although the prices were high, Victoria gritted her teeth and bought them.

She had given most of her savings to Bobby, but she had just received her salary and bonus, which was enough for her expenses.

Passing by a handmade crafts store, she saw some unique and cute items inside. An idea struck her-maybe she could make a handmade gift for Samuel.

It would show her gratitude and sincerity.

After thinking it over, Victoria walked into the store.

A few hours later, she left with her handmade gift in hand.

As she continued shopping, she passed a men's loungewear store. A set of pajamas on a mannequin caught her eye.

The pajamas were simple in design, with a slightly open neckline, silver embroidery on the cuffs, and a simple belt, exuding a sense of understated luxury.

Victoria stared at the pajamas for a long time, a thought suddenly popping into her head.

William would look really sexy in these.

A blush crept onto her cheeks, and her heart beat faster.

After a moment of hesitation, she reached into her pocket for her wallet.

"Miss, these pajamas are beautiful. Are you buying them for your boyfriend?" the sales assistant asked enthusiastically.

"No," Victoria replied, feeling a bit embarrassed.

"Don't be shy," the sales assistant said with a smile.

Victoria was about to say something when a familiar, slightly surprised voice called out, "Ms. Carter?"

Victoria looked up to see Lyanna pulling William's sleeve as they walked toward her.

Victoria's expression instantly became awkward.

"What a coincidence! I didn't expect to run into you here," Lyanna said with a smile.

Victoria forced a stiff smile. "Yeah, what a coincidence."

Harborview City was so big, with so many people, and yet they had to run into each other today.

William stood next to Lyanna, his gaze sweeping over the shopping bags in Victoria's hand, his eyes flickering slightly.

"Ms. Carter, are you buying lingerie?" Lyanna asked.

Victoria lowered her eyes and nodded.

"I'm planning to buy some too," Lyanna said, turning to William and affectionately linking her arm with his. "William, let's go in and take a look."

William glanced at Victoria a few times, a slight smile playing on his lips. "Sure."

Victoria's grip tightened on her shopping bags.

William's "sure" carried a lot of weight.

Seeing her standing still, Lyanna asked, "Ms. Carter, what's wrong? Aren't you going in?"

Victoria quickly replied, "Yes, I'm going in."

The three of them walked into the store, and the sales assistant approached them. "How can I help you?"

"Both this lady and I want to buy some lingerie. Could you recommend something?" Lyanna said with a smile.

She was always proud of her bust size and glanced at Victoria.

Although she was bundled up in winter clothes, making it hard to see their figures, Victoria's slender frame suggested she was probably flat-chested.

The sales assistant nodded and asked, "What size do you usually wear, miss?"

Lyanna had been waiting for this question. She smiled and replied, "D cup."

The sales assistant nodded and went to the counter, bringing out some lingerie for Lyanna, along with a nightgown to wear over it.

Lyanna took the lingerie and threw a flirtatious glance at William. "William, I'm going to try these on."

Victoria stood nearby, watching the two of them display their intimacy, and couldn't help but roll her eyes.

Lyanna emerged from the fitting room, looking stunning. She had a great figure, with delicate features and a voluptuous chest, and the sexy nightgown only accentuated her beauty.

William's gaze lingered on her curvaceous figure for just a few seconds before he looked away indifferently.

###chapter 115 Desire

"Hey William, how do I look?" Lyanna twirled around, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.

She shot a glance at Victoria, her expression a mix of showing off and challenging.

William barely looked up, muttering, "It's fine."

Lyanna's face fell slightly, not getting the reaction she wanted. But she quickly masked her disappointment with a sweet smile and turned to Victoria. "Ms. Carter, why haven't you picked anything yet? Is it too pricey? Don't worry, William's super generous. Since we're here, it's meant to be. He'll cover it for you, right, William?"

William glanced at Victoria, a small smile tugging at his lips. "Sure."

Lyanna's smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered. "See, William's got you covered. What are you waiting for?"

Victoria knew that refusing any further would seem awkward. The sales assistant asked for her size, and Victoria, feeling a bit self-conscious, mumbled, "E cup."

"Wow, you have a great figure!" the sales assistant complimented, handing the lingerie to Victoria.

Victoria took the lingerie, avoiding eye contact, and hurried into the fitting room.

William watched her retreating figure with a hint of amusement in his eyes.

Lyanna snorted softly upon hearing Victoria's size, not believing her figure could be that good.

Victoria took her time in the fitting room before finally coming out.

Lyanna was stunned, her face turning sour as a wave of insecurity washed over her.

Victoria's E cup chest was full and perfectly shaped, her curves alluring and almost flawless.

William's gaze lingered on Victoria, intense and admiring. "It looks great on you."

Lyanna's face twisted in anger and jealousy.

Why? Why did Victoria have to have a better figure and face than her?

While Lyanna went to change, William asked the sales assistant to bring Victoria a few more sets, including some more provocative pieces.

He swiped his card, paid for everything, and left an address for the items to be delivered.

He leaned close to Victoria's ear and whispered, "I'll call you tonight."

His warm breath on her ear made Victoria shiver, her neck flushing red.

"No need, I have a dinner with colleagues tonight," Victoria stammered.

William raised an eyebrow, his voice lazy and teasing. "Cancel it."

Victoria frowned, about to refuse, but Lyanna emerged from the fitting room.

As they left the lingerie store, Victoria said goodbye to the two.

Lyanna, not wanting to let her go so easily, smiled brightly at Victoria. "Ms. Carter, don't leave yet. William is buying me some gifts. You have a good eye for art, help me pick something."

Victoria sighed, "Sorry, I really have plans today."

"Please, Ms. Carter, just a little while," Lyanna pleaded softly.

Victoria pressed her lips together and finally nodded, knowing exactly why Lyanna insisted on dragging her along. It was all about showing off how generous William was to her.

They arrived at the jewelry counter, and Lyanna pointed to a diamond necklace. "William, I really like this one. Can you put it on me?"

"Sure," William nodded.

Lyanna beamed, clinging to his arm. "Thank you, William! I knew you were the best!"

She wrapped her arm around William's muscular one, leaning affectionately on his shoulder. William's expression remained unchanged, though a flicker of impatience crossed his eyes as he patted her head.

Lyanna picked out several more pieces of jewelry, and William paid for everything without blinking, the total exceeding a million dollars, drawing the attention of passersby. People wondered which wealthy man was spending so lavishly.

Victoria sat on a nearby sofa, yawning several times. Growing impatient, she stood up and told them she needed to use the restroom.

Lyanna, still trying on jewelry, waved her off dismissively. "Go ahead."

As Victoria exited the restroom, someone suddenly pulled her into the fire escape. She was about to struggle when a familiar scent hit her, and she found herself pressed against a hard, warm chest, strong arms encircling her waist. Her back was against the cold wall, her spine rigid.

"What are you doing? Let go of me," she panted, fear in her voice.

William's hand caressed her smooth skin, his breath heavy, eyes dark with desire. He leaned in, licking her earlobe, his voice husky. "What do you think?"

Victoria gasped, trembling as she felt his arousal. "William, calm down."

William lifted her chin, kissing her deeply, his tongue invading her mouth, tasting her sweetness. Victoria whimpered, unable to resist his dominant advance.

"William, stop," she protested weakly, her hands pushing against his chest, but he held her tighter. In their struggle, William had hiked up her dress, exposing her long, slender legs. He gripped her waist with one hand, the other cupping her rear, pulling her closer. Their proximity made Victoria's breathing erratic.

"William!" Victoria's eyes widened in fear. What was he doing?

He made a shushing gesture, trying to control his desire. "Be good, don't make a fuss."

His voice was so rough it seemed to come from deep within, filled with longing. Victoria froze, her cheeks burning, hands clutching his jacket.

William held her close, his eyes dark with lust. "Not here," Victoria whispered, her voice trembling.

"No one's around, it's fine," William's voice was even raspier.

Victoria shook her head, unwilling. This was a public place. What if someone saw them?

"I don't want to," Victoria bit her lip, pushing against his chest.

###chapter 116 Are You Jealous?

William let out a low growl, holding Victoria tightly in his arms. It took everything he had to keep his sanity in check.

"Come back to the hotel with me?" William asked, his voice rough.

Victoria, despite feeling the same pull, shook her head and bit her lip. "Your Lyanna is still here," she said softly.

William looked down at her, a smile tugging at his lips. "Are you jealous?"

"No!" Victoria denied firmly.

William's smile widened, a hint of mischief in his eyes. "Really?"

Victoria's body tensed. She knew William's tone was teasing.

Seeing her stunned silence, William's hand slipped under her shirt, caressing her breast. "You look way cuter like this than usual."

His bold move made Victoria feel a wave of heat. She pushed against his chest, embarrassed and annoyed. "That's enough!"

William's hand stilled, and he chuckled softly. "What kind of reaction is this? Playing hard to get?"

Victoria's face turned bright red.

William's gaze darkened as he looked at her flushed face, feeling a painful tightness in his lower body.

But this wasn't the right place.

He released Victoria and pulled out a cigarette from his bag, lighting it to ease his discomfort.

After taking a few deep drags, he managed to suppress his desire. "In a few days, we have a family gathering. I need to pick out gifts for my uncle's kids. Lyanna overheard and insisted on helping me choose."

Victoria stared at him in surprise. Was he explaining himself to her?

As they stood in silence, Lyanna's voice called from outside, "William! Where are you?"

William squinted, extinguished his cigarette, and tossed it in the trash. He kissed Victoria on the cheek and left.

The door closed behind him.

Victoria stood there, dazed, for a long time.

After a while, she composed herself, waiting for the heat in her face to subside before opening the door to the fire escape.

Lyanna and William were gone. Victoria grabbed a sandwich at the mall to fill her stomach and decided to head back to the hotel. On second thought, she went back and bought the set of men's pajamas.

When Victoria returned to the hotel, the lingerie William had bought for her had already been delivered to her room.

Seeing the lace, thongs, and various other items, Victoria's face turned crimson.

As she stood there, lost in thought, William swiped his key card and walked in.

Victoria quickly hid the items under the bed and turned to face him, trying to stay calm. "How did you get in?"

William raised an eyebrow and smiled. "The first time I brought you here, I had the front desk give me a spare key."

His words left Victoria speechless. He was so cunning.

William took off his suit jacket and draped it over a chair. He walked to the bed, picked up a piece of lingerie, and seemed pleased. Then he extended his hand to Victoria. "Come here."

Victoria bit her lip and slowly moved towards him.

William handed her the lingerie and said, "Put it on."

Victoria glanced at the delicate, enticing lingerie in her hand, her face flushing again. "I'm not used to wearing this."

William scoffed at her hesitation. "It's not like you have to wear it outside. You'll be taking it off soon anyway. What's there to be shy about?"

Victoria remained silent, ultimately unable to resist William's insistence. She went into the bathroom and reluctantly changed into the lingerie.

William sat on the sofa, legs crossed, watching her with interest.

Victoria wore a light purple slip dress adorned with rhinestones at the hem. A layer of sheer fabric at the waist hinted at the curves beneath, making her look especially alluring.

Her skin was smooth and delicate, now tinged with a pink hue, making her appear even more enchanting.

William's gaze traveled down her body, lingering on her exposed collarbone.

Her smooth skin, framed by the purple sheer fabric, looked like a poppy flower.

William suddenly wanted to taste it.

He stared at her delicate features for a moment before standing up and walking towards her.

He cupped the back of her head and leaned down, gently capturing her soft lips.

His lips were cool but carried a burning heat. Victoria's face felt like it was on fire, almost melting.

He lightly licked her lower lip, then moved to her neck, nibbling affectionately. A tingling sensation spread through her body, and she dug her nails into her palms to keep from making any noise.

William's kiss didn't stop. His hand roamed over her skin, causing her to shiver.

She couldn't help but moan softly.

William looked up, his deep eyes darkening. He released her lips and whispered in her ear, "Baby, let me hear you."

Victoria bit her lip, refusing to make a sound. His breath against her ear sent a shiver through her, and she let out a small whimper.

William's lips curled into a wicked smile. He suddenly lifted her skirt, his hand exploring upwards, gently kneading her soft breast.

Victoria was already weak from his teasing, her body limp and unable to resist.

William felt his blood boiling. He cursed under his breath, lifted Victoria, and laid her on the bed, pressing down on her.

"William," Victoria panted, calling his name.

William's eyes flickered. He leaned down and captured her lips again.

They kissed passionately, their breathing growing heavier. William urgently tore away her clothes, his hand sliding down to her most intimate area, rubbing it through the thin fabric.

Victoria's body tensed at his touch, instinctively writhing.

William's body was on fire. Victoria clung to his neck, her head thrown back to meet his fervor.

His kisses grew more intense. Victoria felt like she was suffocating. She gripped the bedsheets, trying to stifle her sounds.

William noticed her distress and looked up, seeing tears in Victoria's eyes. He immediately asked, "Victoria, why are you crying?"

###chapter 117 Open Your Eyes and Look at Me

Victoria shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes. "I'm fine," she whispered.

Her voice was so soft, it was almost like a kitten's meow. William's heart melted a little. He gently wiped away the tears at the corner of her eyes with his thumb. "It's okay, don't be scared," he said softly.

His voice was low and husky, carrying a seductive charm that was incredibly alluring.

Victoria's heart raced uncontrollably. William was her Achilles' heel, and she couldn't resist him at all.

She closed her eyes tightly, her long eyelashes trembling like butterfly wings.

William's throat went dry. His kisses trailed down to her soft, firm breasts, and he gently nibbled and sucked on them.

Finally, he couldn't hold back any longer. With a low growl, he thrust into her, hitting the deepest part.

The intense impact made Victoria's whole body stiffen. She clung to William's shoulders, cold sweat breaking out on her forehead.

Feeling Victoria's tense body in his arms, William lowered his head and whispered in her ear, "Victoria, open your eyes and look at me."

Victoria opened her misty eyes, meeting William's burning, deep gaze. His eyes reflected her blurred face, making her feel even more captivated, as if she were drowning in them.

Their young, healthy bodies intertwined, colliding repeatedly.

Victoria felt like the world was spinning. The pain in her body gradually faded, replaced by a strange tingling and excitement.

They held each other tightly. Victoria felt like she was floating, her soul leaving her body.

Her mouth was dry, and it seemed like there was less and less oxygen in her chest. Her head felt dizzy and swollen, her body trembling uncontrollably.

William's movements became rougher. His large hands gripped Victoria's hips as he thrust continuously. Each movement sent shivers through her, her toes curling up.

William's lips and tongue moved from her nose down to her slender neck, lingering there before continuing downward.

Victoria was overwhelmed by his intense thrusts, her body weak and helpless, relying on him to endure the passion he brought.

After what felt like an eternity, he finally released. His forehead rested against hers, whispering, "Victoria, call me honey."

He loved it when she called him Honey, loved the shy, charming way she said his name, making him want to keep her by his side forever.

Victoria was too exhausted to resist, weakly calling out, "Honey!"

William's heart fluttered. He flipped her over, pinning her beneath him, once again having her.

That night, all the lingerie Victoria had just bought was put to use, leaving her exhausted and asleep.

When she woke up, it was already late morning.

Sunlight streamed into the room, filling it with a warm glow.

She moved slightly, feeling sore and weak.

Lifting the blanket, she saw the stained sheets, a wave of shame washing over her.

What had she done last night?

William emerged from the bathroom, freshly washed. Seeing Victoria still lying in bed, he smirked.

He walked over, sat on the edge of the bed, and pinched her cheek playfully. "What, you don't want to get up?"

"Who doesn't want to get up!" Victoria glared at him, struggling to sit up.

William's smile widened. He leaned down and scooped her up in his arms.

Victoria gasped, wrapping her arms around his neck.

William's deep, pleasant voice sounded, "Alright, let's get you cleaned up and then have some breakfast."

He carried her to the bathroom, squeezed toothpaste onto her brush, and handed her the cup, signaling her to brush her teeth.

Victoria pursed her lips, taking the toothbrush and starting to brush her teeth.

Her movements were slow, too tired to stand steadily.

William supported her, saying, "Let me help you."

Victoria quickly shook her head. "No, no, I can do it myself."

Though she had to treat him like her husband for a month, she wasn't used to such intimate contact.

William didn't insist. He sat on the couch, waiting for Victoria to finish.

He propped his head on one hand, his gaze fixed on her profile.

Victoria was focused on brushing her teeth, her delicate skin tinged with a faint pink.

He watched her intently, a gentle look in his eyes.

After breakfast, as they were about to leave, Victoria hesitated before finally deciding to give him the bag of pajamas.

"For me?" William looked at the pajamas in the bag, a smile tugging at his lips.

Victoria nodded awkwardly. "I just bought them on a whim. If you don't like them, you can throw them away."

She wasn't sure if William would wear them, considering he probably had plenty of pajamas at home.

William opened the bag and took out the pajamas.

He unfolded them, glancing at them with a faint smile. "They look great. I like them a lot. Thanks, babe."

Victoria blushed at his words, quickly gathering her things and running off.

William stood at the door, watching her retreating figure, a satisfied smile on his face.

Victoria arrived at the exhibition center. The main setup was already done, so she started adjusting the details.

As she worked, her phone rang, displaying an unfamiliar number.

Victoria answered, "Hello."

A rich, elegant male voice came through the line. "It's me, Robert."

Robert? Victoria thought for a moment before remembering. Robert was Elara's son, a lawyer.

She responded politely, "Mr. Davis, what can I do for you?"

Robert's tone was serious. "Victoria, you asked me about the lawyer for your father's case. I've found out. His name is Maximus Tate."

Victoria's heart skipped a beat. "Really? Thank you so much."

Robert continued, "I heard from my mom that you're in Harborview City. That lawyer is also in Harborview City. If you have time, you should contact him."

"Really? Where is he?" Victoria asked urgently.

Robert replied, "Maplewood Avenue. His phone number is..."

Victoria quickly jotted it down in her notebook, thanking him repeatedly. "Mr. Davis, thank you so much. When I get back to Silvermist City, I'll treat you to dinner."

Robert chuckled. "Don't mention it. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll hang up now."

Victoria ended the call and immediately dialed Maximus's number.

After a few rings, a clear voice answered, "Hello."

"Hello, is this Mr. Maximus Tate?" Victoria asked.

###chapter 118 He Was Framed

"Yeah, I'm Maximus. And you are?"

Victoria quickly introduced herself and jumped right into it. "Hi, Mr. Tate. I'm Alvin's daughter, Victoria. I have some questions about his case."

Maximus responded with a friendly tone, "Sure thing. I'll be in the southern part of Harborview City tomorrow. Let's meet at 9 AM."

Victoria was excited. "Okay, I'll be there on time."

They agreed on a meeting spot, and Victoria hung up the phone.

Victoria took a deep breath and asked Alton for some time off. Alton didn't even ask why and granted her request immediately.

Ever since William had seen him dropping Victoria off at the hotel, Alton had been too embarrassed to face her again. However, he had been keeping an eye on her work at the exhibition center.

Knowing how hard she worked every day, Alton felt a pang of sympathy and agreed without hesitation. If he could, he would rather share some of her burden.

The next day, Victoria arrived at the agreed-upon café half an hour early.

Maximus was already there. In his early forties, he was tall, handsome, and a very charismatic and successful man.

He shook hands with Victoria and greeted her, "I'm Maximus. You must be Ms. Carter? Nice to meet you."

"Yes, Mr. Tate. It's a pleasure to meet you."

After a brief introduction, Victoria got straight to the point. "Mr. Tate, do you remember my father's case?"

Maximus took a sip of his coffee and nodded. "Of course, I remember it very well."

Victoria asked eagerly, "Can you tell me more about it?"

Maximus sighed softly and began, "W took on this case because Mr. Carter was internationally renowned as a master architect. But once we started, things felt very..."

Maximus chose his words carefully, "Strange."

Victoria frowned and pressed, "What exactly seemed strange to you?"

Maximus thought for a moment and then explained, "First, the timing. Why did no one question your father's design when the bridge collapsed ten years ago, but suddenly, after a sports complex collapsed, it all came out? Second, the evidence was weak. Apart from the testimony of the head of the design institute, there was no other documentation or proof."

Maximus furrowed his brow and continued, "And your father himself was odd. Initially, he was adamant that his design was flawless. But then, out of nowhere, he changed his stance and admitted there were flaws, which led to his conviction."

"So, there must be underlying reason!" Victoria exclaimed.

"You could say that. But as for who framed him, there's one person who seems suspicious," Maximus said.

Victoria was puzzled. "Who?"

"The head of the design institute who testified against your father, Lachlan Everest," Maximus replied after a moment of thought.

"Why would he frame my father?" Victoria murmured to herself.

Maximus shook his head. "We couldn't find out. Maybe only he can explain it."

"Do you know where he is now?"

"No," Maximus admitted. "Shortly after the case ended, he was transferred out of Silvermist City."

Victoria's spirits sank, and she looked down in disappointment.

"Don't lose hope. The truth will come out eventually," Maximus reassured her.

Victoria forced a small smile. "Thank you for your help."

"If there's nothing else, I'll be on my way."

After leaving the café, Victoria returned to her hotel and sat on her bed, lost in thought.

Her mind was swirling with thoughts of Alvin's case and Maximus's words.

When William opened the door, he saw Victoria sitting on the bed, looking pale and dazed.

Seeing her like this, William felt an inexplicable pang of sorrow.

He walked over, gently touched her pale face, and asked softly, "What's on your mind?"

Victoria snapped out of her daze and looked up into William's deep, dark eyes, suddenly flustered. "Why are you here again?"

William raised an eyebrow and countered, "Why shouldn't I be here?"

He sat on the edge of the bed, wrapped an arm around Victoria's slender waist, and pulled her into his embrace, leaning down to gaze into her slightly panicked eyes.

His warm breath brushed against Victoria's ear, his deep voice magnetic and alluring. "Didn't sleep well last night? You look terrible."

Victoria tried to avoid touching his warm chest, scooting away to put some distance between them.

"I'm fine."

"Are you sure?" William's tone hinted at disbelief.

Victoria bit her lip and mustered the courage to look into his deep eyes. "I need to ask you for a favor."

"What is it?" he asked.

"My father's case..."

Before Victoria could finish, she felt her body tense as he held her tightly.

William's voice turned icy. "What does your father's case have to do with me?"

Tears welled up in Victoria's eyes as she pleaded, "William, please help me."

Her tears fell onto William's hand, the heat making him frown.

He withdrew his hand and said coolly, "Your father's case was settled two years ago. The court has already ruled. Even if you come to me, it won't change anything."

Victoria bit her lip harder. "But I believe he was framed."

William narrowed his eyes and stared at Victoria. "Framed? By whom?"

Victoria met his gaze. "I don't know how to explain it, but I am certain my father was wronged!"

Victoria's firm tone angered William. He stood up abruptly, looking down at her. "What makes you so sure your father was framed?"

Victoria stood up as well, looking up at him defiantly. "I just know."

She then recounted everything Maximus had told her, adding, "I think the design institute head, Lachlan, is the key. If we find him, we can uncover the truth."

William listened quietly, his expression calm.

He already knew everything Victoria had said, including who Lachlan was.

Two years ago, he had learned from one of his father's former subordinates that the bridge collapse ten years ago, which had killed his parents, was not an accident but a deliberate act.

He had been investigating ever since but had found nothing.

Then, when the sports complex Alvin designed collapsed, Lachlan testified that Alvin's design had a fatal flaw, failing to account for the building's static load, leading to the collapse.

Alvin had later confessed, admitting his design had serious errors, causing severe consequences.

What was there to argue?

But Victoria's mention of Alvin's initial denial and sudden confession caught his attention.

Still, he couldn't believe Alvin was innocent.

Looking at the sorrowful, tear-streaked Victoria, William finally agreed to help her find Lachlan.

###chapter 119 Entanglement

Victoria was over the moon when she heard that William had agreed. She immediately threw herself into his arms, wrapping her arms around his neck and exclaiming excitedly, "This is incredible! I didn't think you'd help me! William, thank you, thank you!"

William gently patted her back and said calmly, "Don't worry, I'll have someone look into Lachlan's background."

Victoria nodded eagerly, "Okay!"

She stood on her tiptoes and planted a kiss on his lips.

William was stunned for a second, then quickly took control, deepening the kiss until she was breathless and he reluctantly let her go.

Victoria's cheeks were flushed, and she lowered her head shyly, afraid to look at him, worried he might see through her thoughts.

William gently stroked her soft, long hair, his voice seductive, "I haven't had enough today. Are you sure you want to run away?"

With that, he pounced again, pressing Victoria onto the couch, his large hand covering her breast, gently kneading.

"Ticklish," Victoria squirmed, trying to escape, but her efforts were futile against his strength. A soft moan escaped her lips, making the air around them sizzle.

"Be good, I just want to kiss you," William murmured, lightly pecking her luscious red lips.

"William!" Victoria's voice changed pitch.

She looked down to see William's soft brown hair brushing against her chest. He first sucked hard, then gently licked, teasing her.

Her nipples, wet with saliva, felt cold in the air, and the rough texture of William's tongue sent shivers down her spine, causing her to release a flood of arousal.

William finally turned his attention back to Victoria, who now clearly sensed the 'trouble' signal. She tried to roll away.

William accurately grabbed her ankle, pulling her back into his arms.

Victoria's arousal left a clear mark on the leather couch as William dragged her.

"William!" Victoria screamed, feeling his fully erect member pressing against her through his suit, soaking the fabric.

"Sorry," William whispered, kissing her neck gently, "I lied. I don't just want to kiss you, I want..."

William impatiently pulled down his pants, his hard member springing free.

The head of his penis, wet and eager, rubbed against Victoria's entrance, teasing but not entering.

Victoria was so aroused by his actions that she felt like she was about to climax even without him inside.

"Why aren't you struggling? Weren't you trying to run just now?" William teased, kissing her cheek. As soon as she relaxed a bit, he suddenly thrust into her, his skill preventing any pain from registering in her mind.

Her cry of pain was replaced by pleasure, and William, seemingly annoyed by her earlier attempt to escape, moved with deliberate intensity, his member hitting her sensitive spots, making her unable to speak.

Just a few thrusts had Victoria's toes curling in pleasure.

"Slower, please," Victoria gasped, her face flushed. She clung to William's neck, seeking support against his powerful movements.

William's arm muscles bulged with effort as he held her waist with one hand, the other kneading her breast. The pleasure shot through her nerves, and William bit her earlobe, "Say my name."

'When does he get so good at this?' Victoria briefly wondered before she was overwhelmed by pleasure.

William lifted her from the couch, still joined, and carried her to the bed.

With each step, his member rubbed inside her, driving her to tears. By the time he laid her on the bed, Victoria was ready to beg for mercy.

William knelt on the bed, still inside her, and began undressing.

He unbuttoned his shirt with one hand, then tossed it aside, leaning over her.

Victoria's breasts were roughly handled, and she had no time to think of anything else. She only felt his member pushing deeper, expanding inside her, while William's strong arms caged her in, his unique scent enveloping her.

William was overwhelmed by the tight, slick feel of her, wanting to stay inside her forever.

"Say my name," he demanded, his voice low and husky.

Victoria, having lost all dignity, immediately complied, "William, please, slower."

She was pinned to the bed by his powerful thrusts, his member repeatedly hitting her sensitive spots, the mix of pain and pleasure overwhelming her.

William, too, was struggling to hold back, his breathing heavy as he tried to stave off his climax. He pulled out slightly, then thrust back in.

Victoria arched her back, sobbing uncontrollably.

Too good.

She clung to William's neck, biting down hard. William pulled out, almost clumsily, ejaculating in the air, a thick white line trailing.

"Damn it."

William's chest heaved as he lay on Victoria, eyes closed, savoring the afterglow, muttering a curse.

They tangled for a long time before William finally let her go, exhausted on the couch.

William carried her to the shower, then to the bedroom.

Lying on the soft bed, Victoria watched William's broad, muscular back, her mind racing.

She slowly crawled closer, her delicate arms wrapping around his shoulders.

Victoria closed her eyes, pressing her cheek to William's firm chest, listening to his strong heartbeat.

In this place far from Alice, she would allow herself to have him for a short while.

When the month ended, she would draw the line with William.

Victoria rested her hand on William's arm, drifting to sleep, vaguely hearing him say, "Sleep."

She fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.

With William's promise, Victoria no longer worried about finding Lachlan.

As the exhibition date approached, her work became increasingly hectic, and she barely had time to eat, spinning like a top every day.

William attended a family dinner with Lyanna and Wayne.

Wayne's eldest son, Dorian Scott, was only a few years younger than William, married and managing a branch in the Kalashea Empire. The younger son, Cassius Scott, had just turned 18 and was in his wild phase, frequenting nightclubs and bars.

William had little interaction with Dorian and Cassius, hardly knowing them.

Lyanna, however, often hung out with them in the Kalashea Empire. Now back home alone, her father asked Wayne to find her a reliable internship.

Wayne entrusted her to William.

At the dinner, Wayne, as the host, raised his glass first. Smiling at William, he said, "William, I heard from your father that you're planning a big move in the new media field in Silvermist City. Do you need my support?"

William smiled slightly, clinking glasses with Wayne, "No need, Uncle Wayne. I want to build my career on my own."

Wayne raised an eyebrow, seemingly impressed, "Good, you're truly the most capable of the Scott family's younger generation!"

He turned to his sons, "Dorian, Cassius, learn from William and strive to stand on your own soon."

Cassius pouted, "Dad, you favor William. I'm your real son."

Wayne pretended to be angry, "So what? My brother only has him left. Who else should I favor?"

Cassius immediately quieted down, shrinking back and drinking obediently.

Dorian held back a laugh at Cassius's sulking.

Lyanna, sitting nearby, felt embarrassed by Cassius's behavior and pinched him hard.

Cassius yelped, looking at Lyanna with a pained expression, "Lyanna, what did I do to deserve this?"

Lyanna glared at him, "Keep talking, and I'll cut your tongue out."

Cassius quickly covered his mouth, shaking his head to show he wouldn't speak.

Everyone laughed, the atmosphere warm and friendly.

Even William, usually serious, couldn't hide his smile.

Just then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen.

It was a message from Harry: [Mr. Scott, Lachlan is currently in Harborview City, and I discovered that Wayne met with him after returning.]

###chapter 120 We're Family

The text message also included a photo of Lachlan.

It was the same guy who was with Wayne when William saw them at the restaurant last time.

William stared at the photo, his eyes deep and unreadable.

Why did Wayne know Lachlan?

Why did Wayne meet him right after returning to the country?

William glanced at Wayne, who was sitting at the head of the table with a kind smile, and suddenly felt a chill down his spine.

He clenched his fists, trying to hide the coldness on his face.

Wayne noticed his unusual behavior and frowned in confusion. "William, is something wrong?"

William lifted his gaze slightly and said calmly, "It's nothing, Uncle Wayne. Just some issues at the company."

Wayne, hearing this, showed concern. "Are you in trouble? If you can't handle it, remember to let me know. We're family, after all. I won't stand by and do nothing."

William forced a slight smile. "Thanks, Uncle Wayne. I can handle it."

Wayne nodded. "Good, I know you can."

After dinner, William took the drunken Lyanna back to her room in the hotel and was about to call Harry to come over.

Just as he turned to leave, Lyanna suddenly grabbed his arm. "William, I have a headache."

William stopped, looking at her with clear, cold eyes. "You're drunk."

His tone was steady but left no room for argument.

Lyanna felt uneasy but pretended to be nonchalant, mumbling, "Uncle Wayne said you should take good care of me."

Her voice trailed off, clearly lacking confidence.

William initially didn't want to continue dealing with her, but hearing her mention Wayne, he suddenly had a change of heart.

"You want me to take care of you?" he asked, his tone calm.

Lyanna, overjoyed, nodded quickly and pulled William towards the bedroom.

Once inside, William closed the door behind them.

Victoria had come to ask William if he had found any information about Lachlan, but she didn't expect to witness such a scene.

Although she knew he had many women around him, seeing it so blatantly in front of her was a first.

Victoria's heart felt like it was being pricked by needles, a faint pain spreading through her chest.

She bit her lip, forcing herself to leave.

But she couldn't move her feet. Her legs felt like they were filled with lead, heavy and immovable, and tears began to flow uncontrollably.

Victoria kept telling herself, "William and you only had a physical relationship. You shouldn't fall in love with him. Believe in yourself. You're smart and won't be foolish."

However, despite her self-reassurance, the tears wouldn't stop, quickly soaking the front of her shirt.

A passing janitor noticed and called out in surprise, "Miss, are you okay?"

The silence was broken.

Victoria hurriedly wiped her tears, nodded at the janitor, and said lightly, "I'm fine."

After that, she turned and quickly left, as if being chased by a wild beast.

She had just reached the hotel lobby when she saw Harry coming in through the main entrance.

Seeing Victoria's tear-streaked face, Harry was momentarily stunned, then quickly approached her with concern. "Ms. Carter, what happened? Why are you crying? Did someone mess with you?"

Victoria wiped her face haphazardly and shook her head. "I'm fine."

Harry looked at her worriedly. "Did something happen? If you have any difficulties, just tell me."

Victoria pressed her lips together and shook her head. "Harry, I'm really fine. I came to ask if Mr. Scott found any information about Lachlan."

Harry was taken aback, not expecting Victoria to be looking for William for this.

He hesitated and said, "There is news, but..."

Victoria immediately became anxious, grabbing his arm and looking at him with pleading eyes. "Harry, please, you have to tell me. I'm begging you."

Harry sighed and decided to tell the truth. "Lachlan is in Harborview City. He's now the director of the Institute of Architectural Standard Design at Crystalia."

Hearing this, Victoria felt like her blood had frozen.

The Institute of Architectural Standard Design!

That's a national-level design institute.

Lachlan was the director there!

No wonder his testimony led the court to determine that Alvin's design was flawed, resulting in his conviction and imprisonment!

Victoria clenched her fists, the pain in her chest so intense it nearly made her collapse.

After a long while, she managed to regain her composure and hoarsely said to Harry, "Thank you, Harry. I need to go."

With that, she turned and quickly left.

She needed to calm down and think about what to do next.

Harry watched her leave, a look of worry flashing across his face. After hesitating for a moment, he took out his phone and called William.

The call was quickly answered, and William's deep voice came through.

Harry lowered his voice and said, "Mr. Scott, Ms. Carter seems to be in a bad state."

William, holding back Lyanna's wandering hands with one hand and the phone with the other, replied indifferently, "Oh? What happened?"

Harry thought for a moment and said, "I saw her crying as she left the hotel. She wouldn't say what was wrong. Then she asked me about Lachlan, and since you asked me to look into it for her, I told her."

William's eyes darkened, and he quietly ordered, "From now on, don't tell her anything without my permission."

After hanging up, William glanced at Lyanna, who was still moaning in his arms, feeling a surge of disgust.

He let go of her and stood up. "I have to go. Tonight's over."

Lyanna opened her hazy eyes, pitifully tugging at his shirt. "William, don't go."

She had taken off her jacket, revealing her sexy lingerie underneath, her ample chest almost spilling out.

William frowned impatiently. "Okay. I won't leave if you tell me why you wanted to be my secretary."

Lyanna blushed, shyly staring at William's handsome profile. "Because I like you."

William sneered, his mocking gaze falling on her smooth skin. "So what? I don't need a secretary, and I certainly don't need a sex partner."

"Then I'll be your sex partner, William."

She was flushed, her forehead covered in sweat, her face red.

She kept calling William's name, her breathy voice enough to arouse most men.

Lyanna stood on tiptoe, trying to kiss William.

But William remained unmoved, turning his head to avoid her kiss, a cold sneer on his lips.

He grabbed her delicate chin, leaning in close, his voice filled with danger. "Tell me, how did you know I didn't have a secretary in Kalashea Empire?"

Lyanna froze, instinctively avoiding William's gaze.

She nervously twisted her skirt, stammering for a while before whispering, "Uncle Wayne told me."

###chapter 121 What Right Do You Have?

Her response deepened the shadows in William's eyes.

So it really was about Wayne.

"Did he ever ask you about me? Or did you tell him where I was?"

Lyanna looked up at him, biting her lip, and nodded. "Yeah."

William narrowed his eyes and let out a cold snort. "What did he ask you?"

Lyanna hesitated for a long time before lowering her head and slowly saying, "Not long after I became your secretary, he asked me about the company and..."

"And what else?"

Lyanna kept her head down, not daring to look at William, and stammered, "He also asked about Victoria."

William's fists clenched suddenly, his gaze sharp as he glanced at Lyanna. "What did you say?"

Lyanna trembled all over, "I-I said Victoria was just a slut, always trying to seduce you."

After she finished speaking, she sneaked a glance at William, only to see his eyes dark, his lips pressed into a thin line, and his demeanor chilling. She quickly shut her mouth, not daring to say another word.

William suppressed his anger, calmly adjusted his tie, and said indifferently, "Let's not talk about this for now. From now on, just do your job for me. Remember, if I find out you're reporting to Uncle Wayne behind my back again, you'll face the consequences."

His tone was extremely calm, but it sent a chill through Lyanna's entire body.

With that, William slammed the door and left.

Lyanna stood there in a daze, her eyes gradually filling with tears.

Victoria returned to the hotel, her mind occupied with thoughts of Lachlan and the image of William being pulled into a room by Lyanna.

Thinking about it, she felt a faint pain in her chest.

She sat on the sofa, burying her face in her knees, her eyes stinging, but she forced herself not to cry.

'You're just a mistress, what right do you have to be jealous?' she thought.This churned in Victoria's mind, growing stronger and stronger.

She kept repeating it to herself, warning herself.

After a while, Victoria slowly lifted her head, her eyes red, her expression dazed, like a soulless puppet, staring blankly ahead.

A crisp knock on the door startled her.

Victoria quickly adjusted her expression and wiped away her tears.

"Who is it?" she asked, sniffling.

The door opened, and William stood there holding two cups of warm cocoa.

He handed one to Victoria. "Drink this."

Victoria stared blankly at the steaming warm cocoa in her hand, her eyes red, her throat choked up.

"Why are you here?" she sniffled, her voice muffled.

Wasn't he supposed to be with Lyanna in the room? How did he have time to come find her?

William set down the other cup of hot cocoa and approached Victoria, wrapping his arm around her slender shoulders and pulling her into his embrace.

Victoria's body stiffened, and she immediately began to struggle. "Don't touch me!"

William held her tighter, as if afraid she would escape if he let go.

"Stop it, let's talk." William's voice was gentle.

"There's nothing to talk about between us. Let go of me now!" Victoria struggled, tears streaming uncontrollably down her face.

"Don't move." He grabbed her wrist, his warm, broad hand gently patting her slender arm, his magnetic voice filled with a soothing charm.

Victoria's body went limp, and she stopped resisting.

William rested Victoria's head on his shoulder, letting her lean against him.

"Did you see me go into Lyanna's room earlier?" he asked softly.

"Yeah," Victoria replied sullenly.

"Nothing happened between us. I'm not interested in her at all. I just had something to ask her. Don't overthink it, okay?"

Victoria kept her head down, not responding to his words.

Whether he was telling the truth or not, what right did she have to question him?

They only had a month left on their contract. What right did she have to accuse him?

Seeing her disbelief, William sighed and tugged at the corner of his mouth. "Didn't I tell you? I can only get hard for your body!"

Victoria's face turned bright red at his blunt words, and she punched him hard. "You jerk!"

William caught her small fist and pressed it against his chest, laughing. "Don't believe me? Feel for yourself!"

Then, he moved her hand down to his lower abdomen.

Victoria felt his heat and blushed furiously.

He was actually hard!

"William, you!" Victoria was both embarrassed and angry, trying to pull her hand back, but William suddenly leaned in and covered her lips with his, kissing her deeply and passionately.

Caught off guard, Victoria almost suffocated from his kiss, clutching the buttons of his shirt tightly, enduring his wild and domineering kiss.

After a long time, they finally separated, both panting heavily as they stared at each other.

William's eyes were filled with desire. He licked Victoria's swollen, red lips, his voice hoarse. "Still doubting me?"

Victoria's heart raced, and she swallowed nervously, turning her head away and pretending to be calm. "No."

"Good girl." William ruffled her hair and brought the hot cocoa to her. "Open your mouth."

Victoria obediently opened her mouth, letting him feed her a big sip. She couldn't help but frown. "Where did you get this hot cocoa? It's so sweet it's sickening."

William couldn't help but laugh at her puffed-up cheeks. "Someone was jealous, so I asked the shop to add extra sugar."

Victoria's cheeks burned, and she quickly changed the subject. "Thanks for finding out about Lachlan so quickly."

William smiled. "I've always taken your matters seriously."

"Thank you. I'll handle the rest myself. No need to trouble you."

Hearing this, William's smile faded, and he frowned. "Don't rush. Let me investigate further. I warn you, don't act on your own."

Seeing his serious expression, Victoria knew this matter wasn't simple.

But for Alvin's sake, she didn't want to back down. She forced a smile and said, "Got it. I won't do anything rash."

"Good girl." William stroked her long hair, satisfied.

Victoria promised William she wouldn't act rashly, but she was too anxious to just wait around. She couldn't suppress her inner urge.

Even if she didn't go directly to Lachlan, she had to check out his workplace.

Maybe she'd get lucky and find some clues.

Fortunately, the Institute of Architectural Standard Design wasn't far from the exhibition center. Taking advantage of her lunch break, she took a cab to the design institute.

###chapter 122 Kidnapping

The Institute of Architectural Standard Design might not be huge, but it covers a vast area, with towering buildings and renowned designers gathered there.

Victoria stood at the corner of the bus stop, scanning the area for any sign of Lachlan.

Suddenly, she heard footsteps passing by her side.

She turned her head and was shocked to see Wayne.

What was he doing here?

Could it be a coincidence?

Victoria thought she was seeing things and blinked hard, but it was definitely Wayne.

She quickly bent down, pretending to tie her shoelaces, and sneaked a glance at Wayne.

Wayne seemed unaware of her presence and walked straight into the building with his assistant.

Victoria breathed a sigh of relief.

The building had security, requiring either a pass or someone inside to let you in. Wayne was clearly let in by someone inside, as a group of people greeted him as soon as he entered.

From her distance, Victoria couldn't make out who was welcoming him.

She pretended to be a passerby, sneaking a few glances inside.

She thought she was being discreet, but Wayne had already noticed her every move.

Victoria waited at the entrance for a long time, but Wayne didn't come out. Feeling the urge to use the restroom, she headed to the nearby public bathroom.

As she approached, she saw a middle-aged man in shabby clothes anxiously looking around.

When Victoria walked by, the man nervously approached her. "Miss, can you help me?"

"Help?" Victoria looked at him, feeling something was off.

The man hesitated, then blushed and handed her something. "Miss, my daughter is in the last stall. She just got her period. Could you please give her this sanitary pad?"

He handed her the pad, smiling awkwardly.

Victoria was momentarily stunned but then understood. This was a common situation for girls, and she had experienced it herself.

She took the pad and smiled at the man. "Don't worry, I'll take care of it."

"Thank you so much."

"No problem." Victoria walked into the last stall with the pad.

As soon as she opened the door, a spray hit her face, and she lost consciousness.

William knew Victoria wouldn't just sit around, so he had Harry assign someone to follow her early in the morning.

When he learned she was heading to the Institute of Architectural Standard Design, he suspected trouble and immediately rushed there with Harry.

The bodyguard protecting Victoria saw her enter the women's restroom but didn't dare to follow, waiting outside instead.

Unexpectedly, she didn't come out for a long time, and the middle-aged man who had asked her to deliver the pad was gone.

The bodyguard, worried, entered the restroom, only to find it empty.

Panicked, he called William to report.

William's face darkened as he ordered the bodyguard to keep searching the area.

With a cold, menacing aura, William called for surveillance footage from the area.

Minutes later, he received a crucial lead. After Victoria entered the restroom, someone left through the back door with a large suitcase and got into a black van.

The van's license plate and current location were sent to William, who immediately drove there.

When William and Harry arrived, the van was parked in a remote area, but the occupants were gone.

Harry, a former special forces member skilled in tracking, examined the surroundings.

He quickly found some clues.

Worried about Victoria's safety, William couldn't wait for backup. After calling for a helicopter, he and Harry headed into the wilderness.

Victoria slowly regained consciousness, her head throbbing.

As she became more aware, she realized she was in a dilapidated house, the air thick with dampness and mold.

The place seemed abandoned for a long time, with water stains and moss on the walls and cobwebs in the corners.

Fear gripped her, and she trembled uncontrollably.

She struggled against the ropes but couldn't break free.

Victoria knew fear wouldn't help. She had to stay calm.

Taking a deep breath, she tried to steady her breathing and began to survey her surroundings for an escape route.

Just then, her captors entered the room.

They wore masks, revealing only their cold, menacing eyes, staring at Victoria like she was prey.

One of them approached, grabbed her hair, and yanked her head up. "What were you doing at the Institute of Architectural Standard Design?"

Victoria winced in pain but held her ground. "I don't know what you're talking about!"

"Don't play dumb! You better start talking!" The man slapped her hard, making her head spin.

"Last chance. Tell me why you were at the Institute of Architectural Standard Design, or else!"

Victoria bit her lip, knowing she had to say something.

"I was looking for Lachlan. I wanted to ask him about my dad's design plans from years ago."

The man frowned, thinking it over, then pressed her again. "Really?"

"Yes, absolutely."

The man scrutinized her, seeing sincerity in her eyes, and believed her somewhat.

He asked, "How did you find Lachlan?"

Victoria didn't want to involve Maximus or William.

Her instincts told her these people would harm William.

She shook her head, trying to stay calm. "I was looking for inspiration online and found out Lachlan is now the director at the Institute of Architectural Standard Design, so I went to see him."

Her explanation seemed plausible, and the man believed most of it.

He then asked, "One last question. What does William, the man keeping you, know?"

###chapter 123 Bury Her

Victoria froze for a moment when she heard the words, then quickly lowered her head to hide the shock in her eyes.

This guy actually knew William! And he knew she was William's mistress.

Despite her surprise, Victoria kept a calm front and said, "I haven't told him anything. He hates my dad. If I even mention him, he loses it, so I don't dare."

The man scoffed, clearly not buying Victoria's story.

He stood up and signaled to the other two men in the room.

One of them left and came back with a big basin of water, placing it in front of Victoria.

"What are you gonna do?" Victoria shouted, panic in her voice.

The man didn't waste any time. He shoved Victoria's head into the basin, holding her down despite her frantic struggles.

Victoria choked on the water, her throat burning with pain.

She fought desperately, her hands flailing against the water's surface. Just as she felt she was about to suffocate, the man yanked her out of the water.

Victoria's face was flushed red, her mouth filled with water, her throat in agony, unable to even cough.

The man disdainfully tossed the basin aside and lit a cigarette. "I'm warning you one more time. If you try any tricks, I have plenty of ways to make you suffer."

Victoria clutched her throat, gasping for air.

The man took a drag from his cigarette, exhaling a thick cloud of smoke, and said slowly, "I'll ask you again. What does William know? If you don't tell the truth, I'll rape and kill you."

Victoria's body trembled involuntarily at his words. She looked at the man with tear-filled eyes, her lips quivering as she said, "He really doesn't know anything. He just uses me for his pleasure. The one he loves is Alice. He doesn't care about me at all."

At the mention of Alice, the man's eyes flickered briefly but quickly returned to normal.

He glanced at his watch, not wanting to waste any more time with Victoria, and ordered the others, "Take her outside."

"Yes, sir."

Two men responded and grabbed Victoria, dragging her out.

"What are you gonna do?" Victoria screamed in terror.

The man ignored her and left the small house.

Outside, there was a barren field with a large pit already dug in one corner.

"Bury her!"

With that, the man turned and left. The remaining two men immediately taped Victoria's mouth shut and dragged her to the pit. No matter how much she struggled, they pushed her into the pit.

Victoria watched as the dirt slowly swallowed her. She thrashed wildly.

But it was no use.

The dirt piled higher, and her movements grew weaker.

Victoria felt her body grow cold, her breathing labored, as despair and fear consumed her.

'No, save me! Help!' she could only whimper through the tape over her mouth.

The dirt covered her chest, her nose, and ears, making it hard to breathe.

Victoria's pupils dilated, her eyes bloodshot, tears streaming down her cheeks as she closed her eyes in despair.

The men finished filling the pit and were about to tamp down the dirt when a lookout called through the walkie-talkie, "Hurry, someone's coming."

Hearing this, the leader stopped and ordered, "Let's go. We can't get caught."

The others quickly left, and the leader disappeared into the night with an iron rod.

Just as they left, William and Harry followed the trail to the house.

Harry saw the door ajar and kicked it open.

The house was small, and they quickly searched it, finding no one.

In the middle of the room was a basin and some water stains, evidence that someone had been there recently.

William squinted, a bad feeling gnawing at him.

He clenched his fists, trying to control his anxiety, and ordered Harry, "Send out a search party. We must find her today!"

Harry nodded and rushed out.

William was about to leave when he noticed a splash of red in the corner, his pupils contracting.

He walked over and stared at the vivid red stain.

It was blood!

He ran to the spot, shouting, "Harry, come back!"

Harry had just stepped outside when he heard William's shout and quickly returned.

William looked at the freshly dug earth, his eyes wide with rage.

A voice in his head told him-Victoria was buried there.

He couldn't wait for tools and began digging with his bare hands.

Sweat beaded on William's forehead from worry, his fingers bleeding as he dug, but he didn't care, continuing to dig frantically.

Harry, seeing William's desperation, was terrified and tried to stop him. "Mr. Scott, calm down."

William pushed Harry away, continuing to dig, muttering, "Victoria, wait for me. I'll find you."

Harry had no choice but to help dig.

William's well-manicured fingers were torn and bloody, but he seemed oblivious to the pain, relentlessly digging.

Finally, their combined efforts revealed a strand of hair.

William was overjoyed, clearing the dirt to uncover Victoria's body.

Victoria lay in the filthy dirt, her clothes disheveled, her hair a mess, her lips pale, and she wasn't breathing.

"Victoria." William felt his mind go blank, then vomited a mouthful of blood.

He reached out, trembling, to touch Victoria's cold, pale face, murmuring, "Victoria, wake up."

He knelt, holding Victoria's body, sobbing like a child.

Harry, unable to bear William's pain, shouted, "Mr. Scott, she's still warm. Try CPR!"

"Yes, CPR." William clung to this last hope and immediately began.

William knelt over Victoria, performing CPR, his eyes red, tears streaming down his face, dripping into the dirt.

Suddenly, a violent cough erupted, and Victoria spewed out a mouthful of filth.

###chapter 124 No Trace

William ignored the foul smell and quickly stood up to help Victoria lie down on the ground, administering CPR.

Victoria's eyes fluttered open, her vision blurry. She struggled to speak, using all her strength to call out, "William."

Her voice was faint and unclear. William leaned closer to her, softly reassuring, "Don't worry, I'm right here, Victoria."

Victoria's panic subsided as she took in William's strikingly handsome features, and tears streamed down her face. "William, I thought I'd never see you again."

William wiped away her tears and kissed the corner of her eyes, his voice hoarse, "Shh, it's okay. You're safe now."

At that moment, the sound of a helicopter's rotors filled the air.

William looked up to see the helicopter landing in a nearby clearing.

He lifted Victoria in his arms and walked towards the helicopter.

After about a half-hour flight, they finally arrived at the hospital. The doctors examined Victoria and found that aside from being severely frightened and having a minor lung infection from nearly drowning, she was otherwise unharmed.

The doctor instructed the nurse to take Victoria to a room to rest.

William stayed by her side, watching her pale face as she slept, his heart aching.

He gently brushed his hand over Victoria's brow, his voice filled with fear, "Victoria, thank goodness you're okay. What would I have done if something happened to you?"

Harry approached, ready to report his findings.

William stopped him and led him into the hallway, asking, "What did you find out?"

Harry frowned, his expression serious and uneasy. "The car's license plate was fake, and the people who kidnapped Ms. Carter have all disappeared."

Hearing this, William clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white. He growled through gritted teeth, "Useless!"

Harry remained silent, accepting the reprimand.

As the head of security, it was his failure to prevent Victoria's kidnapping, and he hadn't found any leads. William's anger was justified.

"Mr. Scott, I'm sorry."

William's face was dark, his anger barely contained. "Forget it, it's not your fault. If it was his doing, it's normal you couldn't find any clues."

Harry felt even more guilty hearing this. "Mr. Scott, I failed in my duty. I'm willing to accept any punishment!"

William sighed and shook his head. "It's not your fault. This was my oversight."

William knew it wasn't Harry's fault. The perpetrator had planned this meticulously, leaving no trace. But he hadn't expected Victoria to be harmed.

"Now, find out where Lachlan is. If possible, 'invite' him over!" William's tone was chilling.

Harry nodded and left.

Meanwhile, at The Scott Manor, Wayne slapped Dorian hard across the face. "Idiot! You're getting dumber by the day! How did I end up with such a foolish son? You can't even handle a simple task!"

Dorian clutched his swollen cheek, lowering his eyes to hide his resentment and hatred. "Father, believe me, I didn't think she could survive that. She got lucky this time, but next time..."

Wayne wasn't having it. His anger flared, and he kicked Dorian's knee. "Next time? Do you think William is as stupid as you?"

He kicked Dorian again, harder this time.

Dorian grunted in pain, falling to one knee. He bit his lip, enduring the pain without making a sound.

Wayne, shaking with rage, grabbed a golf club and struck Dorian's back. "You useless fool! If William finds out, I'll kill you myself!"

Dorian pressed his lips together, enduring the blows.

"Father," Dorian called weakly, "he won't find out. I was very discreet."

Wayne, panting, put down the club and sat, drinking some tea to calm his anger. "What about Lachlan? How did you handle him?"

"I've sent him abroad. We have his daughter; he won't talk," Dorian replied respectfully.

"If killing him wasn't so obvious, I'd have done it already. Keeping him is a risk," Wayne's eyes gleamed with malice.

"Don't worry, Father. I'll have him watched around the clock. He won't ruin our plans," Dorian said quietly.

Wayne waved him off, and Dorian left the room.

The next day, Victoria woke up to a dimly lit room, the curtains drawn.

She slowly sat up, rubbing her aching head. The nightmare of the previous day still haunted her, making it hard to breathe.

"Victoria, are you okay?" William opened the curtains, letting warm sunlight flood the room, dispelling the darkness and making Victoria feel much better.

Victoria turned to William, smiling. "I feel a lot better."

William noticed she still looked pale but seemed more spirited.

He sighed in relief, smiling at her. "Hungry?"

Victoria nodded. "I'm starving."

William chuckled and brought over a tray of food.

The meal was simple: a bowl of oatmeal, a vegetable salad, and some fried shrimp. The fresh ingredients made it look appetizing.

Victoria couldn't help but swallow, taking a spoonful of oatmeal. It was soft and flavorful, soothing her taste buds.

Even her fears and pain seemed to fade.

"This is delicious," Victoria praised.

"Eat as much as you like," William said with a smile.

Watching her eat heartily, William felt a warm, comforting sensation in his chest.

After eating, Victoria finally had the strength to ask about the previous day's events. "Did they catch the people who kidnapped me?"

William's handsome face darkened, his tone cold. "No."

Victoria was stunned, then frowned. "Do you know who did it?"

"I have a good idea, but no proof," William replied, his eyes narrowing with complex emotions.

Victoria paused, then asked, "What about Lachlan? I think he's involved."

###chapter 125 Car Accident

"He got away!" William growled, clenching his teeth. "The people I sent to find him came up empty. He vanished without a trace. I bet he skipped the country!"

Victoria's face went pale as she listened, her voice shaking. "It's all my fault. I should've listened to you. I shouldn't have gone looking for clues on my own. I ended up tipping him off."

By the end, Victoria's eyes were red, tears welling up.

Victoria was filled with self-loathing. Just when they had found a lead to clear Alvin's name, she ruined it due to her foolishness!

William's heart ached. He quickly tried to comfort her. "Don't beat yourself up. I promise I'll find the evidence to clear your father's name."

This was not just for Alvin, but also to uncover the truth about his own parents' deaths!

Victoria sniffled, trying to hold back her tears. "William, thank you for saving me and for helping me."

Her expression was one of sorrow and despair.

William gently patted her shoulder, speaking softly. "Don't cry. Focus on getting better first."

"I feel fine," Victoria insisted. "I was just a bit shaken up. I want to be discharged this afternoon."

William frowned, worried. "That's not a good idea. You've been through a lot. You should stay in the hospital for a few days."

Victoria was stubborn. "I'm really okay."

With the exhibition coming up, she didn't want her condition to delay their work.

Seeing her determination, William had no choice but to relent.

Thanks to Victoria's meticulous planning, the home design exhibition went off without a hitch and received rave reviews.

Victoria's work in Harborview City was done, but William needed to stay a couple more days to handle some Scott family matters. Victoria had planned to wait for him so they could return to Silvermist City together.

Unexpectedly, she received a call from Ryan.

Ryan's voice sounded anxious. "Victoria, where are you right now?"

Victoria was taken aback. "I'm on a business trip in Harborview City. What's wrong?"

Ryan angrily replied, "Samuel's been in an accident and is in the hospital. Come see him right away."

Victoria's heart skipped a beat, her mind going blank. "How is he?"

"He was in a car accident. He's in critical condition at Dawn Healthcare Center," Ryan's voice was hoarse.

Victoria immediately stood up. "Okay, I'll book a flight and come right away!"

She hurriedly bought the earliest flight to Silvermist City.

Victoria arrived in Silvermist City at 8 PM. She quickly hailed a cab to Dawn Healthcare Center.

When she reached the hospital room, Ryan was by Samuel's bedside.

Seeing her, Ryan looked relieved and grabbed her arm. "You're finally here!"

Victoria anxiously looked at Samuel lying in bed. "What happened? How did he get into an accident?"

Ryan sighed. "It's because of you! Ever since he got back from the Arctic and heard you and William were in Harborview City, he's been out of sorts. I'm really at a loss with him. He's thirty years old but acts like a kid when it comes to you."

Victoria bit her lip, feeling guilty. "I'm sorry."

"Alright," Ryan said, patting her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her. "Don't blame yourself. He's not dead, just has a broken leg."

Hearing this, Victoria let out a sigh of relief, her heart finally settling.

She turned to look at Samuel. His eyes were closed, his face pale, and his forehead wrapped in thick bandages.

His handsome face was covered in scratches, and his lips were bruised, making him look pitiful.

Seeing Victoria's worried expression, Ryan sighed. "Victoria, you need to think carefully. Who's better for you? William, who keeps hurting you and flirting with others, or Samuel, who's mature and devoted to you?"

Victoria lowered her eyes.

She knew the difference between William and Samuel.

No matter how sweet things were with William in Harborview City, once they returned to Silvermist City, William would go back to Alice.

She was just a thief, stealing a few days of happiness.

Thinking of this, Victoria softly said, "Thank you. I'll think about it. I have a few days off. I'll stay and take care of him."

"Good," Ryan nodded. "He'll be happy to see you. Take care of him for now."

With that, he left the room, giving Victoria and Samuel some space.

Victoria walked to Samuel's side and sat down. She gently touched his forehead, whispering, "Samuel."

Feeling the heat from his forehead, Victoria was startled. He had a fever!

She quickly called for a doctor to check his temperature and start an IV.

After everything was settled, Victoria leaned back in the chair by the bed, closing her eyes in exhaustion.

So much had happened recently. She needed rest.

As she was drifting off, she faintly heard Samuel's weak voice: "Victoria, don't leave me. Don't go."

She opened her eyes and looked at the bed.

In the dim light, Samuel's face looked even paler. He was clutching the blanket, his expression pained, his brows furrowed.

Seeing him like this, Victoria felt her heart ached.

She held his hand, gently stroking it. "Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. I'll stay with you."

Samuel seemed to hear her; he calmed down and gradually fell asleep.

Victoria sighed softly, leaning against the bed, slowly closing her eyes.

The next morning, Victoria felt someone touching her forehead.

"Are you awake?" Samuel's voice was deep and soothing.

Victoria opened her eyes to see Samuel gazing at her, his eyes filled with deep affection.

"Are you feeling better?"

Seeing Samuel's bandaged ankle, Victoria looked down, feeling guilty, unable to meet his gaze.

Samuel smiled and gently ruffled her hair. "Silly, I'm fine. But why did you come?"

Victoria bit her lip. "Ryan called me yesterday and told me about your accident. I was so scared. How could I not come?"

Her eyes reddened, tears threatening to fall.

"Ryan always talks too much. Don't take it to heart," Samuel comforted her.

"No..." Victoria started to say, but her phone rang, interrupting her.

###chapter 126 Wishing You Happiness

Victoria pulled out her phone. It was William calling. She hesitated for a moment, gave Samuel an apologetic smile, and stepped into the hallway before answering.

As soon as the call connected, William's voice, cold and furious, erupted from the other end. "Victoria, where the hell did you go? Why didn't you come back to the hotel last night?"

Victoria was taken aback but quickly composed herself. "Sorry, something urgent came up. I had to get back to Silvermist City."

William struggled to contain his anger. "What was so urgent?"

Victoria hesitated. She wasn't sure how to explain to William that she had come back to Silvermist City for Samuel.

William's patience wore thin. "Victoria!"

Hearing the change in his tone, Victoria quickly replied, "A friend of mine was in a car accident. I came to Silvermist City to visit them."

"Your friend?" William scoffed. "Wendy? Or is it that Samuel guy?"

Victoria's heart skipped a beat. "How did you know?"

On the other end, William's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Victoria, you're something else. One minute you're all lovey-dovey with me in Harborview City, and the next, you can't wait to run back to Silvermist City to throw yourself at another man!"

Victoria, who had felt a twinge of guilt, now felt her eyes sting with unshed tears as she listened to his accusations.

She fought to keep her voice steady. "William, our one-month agreement is almost up. I don't need to report my every move to you, do I? Don't forget, your fiancée Alice is still waiting for you in Silvermist City."

William's eyes narrowed at the mention of Alice. "What do you mean? Are you saying that as soon as you return to Silvermist City, you're done with me?"

Victoria took a deep breath, holding back her tears. "Yes. After all, she's your fiancée, the one you love the most. I have no reason to keep holding onto you. Do you expect me to remain the hidden lover forever?"

"Don't you dare!" William's voice was filled with rage. "Victoria, I'm warning you, don't push my limits."

"Am I pushing your limits, or are you pushing mine? William, tell me, who do you choose: Alice or me?" Victoria's voice was firm, unyielding.

She knew asking this was setting herself up for heartbreak, but she had no choice. She needed to break free from this situation.

She couldn't continue being just a mistress.

William's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes dark and unreadable.

After a long pause, he finally spoke. "You know, between you and her, there's only ever been one choice."

Hearing this, the last bit of hope in Victoria's heart vanished.

Of course, no matter how much they acted like a normal couple in Harborview City, it was all an illusion.

How could she expect William to give up Alice for her?

Alice, the one he had once fled a wedding for, the one he cherished above all.

Victoria took a deep breath, calming herself. "I understand. In that case, I wish you and Alice all the happiness."

Just as she was about to hang up, William's voice came through urgently. "Victoria, what if I said that even if I marry her, I'd still take care of you? Would you believe me?"

Victoria was momentarily stunned, then let out a bitter laugh. "William, don't you think that's ridiculous? Are you asking me to stay your secret mistress forever? What do you take me for?"

Her voice was filled with anger, but more than that, it was filled with sorrow.

"No, you misunderstand." William's voice was desperate. "I mean..."

"William, is there anything else? If not, I'm hanging up."

"Wait." William's voice softened. "Victoria, let's talk when I get back..."

"William, I'm exhausted. I'm really tired." Victoria's voice broke. "Since you've chosen Alice, please, don't disturb me anymore. I've decided to be with Samuel."

Victoria said everything she needed to in one breath.

"Don't you dare!"

Before William could finish, the call was disconnected.

William stared at the phone in his hand, his face growing darker by the second, his eyes filled with a storm of emotions.

He threw the phone against the wall, shattering it, his teeth clenched in fury.

Victoria wiped away her tears, composed herself, and walked back into Samuel's hospital room.

Samuel saw her red eyes and immediately knew who had upset her. He felt a pang of helplessness but managed a gentle smile.

"Victoria, come sit and rest for a bit."

Victoria nodded, sitting down beside him and forcing a smile. "Sorry, Samuel, for making a fool of myself in front of you."

She lowered her head, trying to hide her vulnerability.

"Don't say that. I'm more worried about you than anything else." Samuel patted her hand gently, comforting her.

"Thank you, Samuel."

Samuel shook his head and reached out to smooth her hair.

"Samuel, I made you something. I hope you don't mind." Victoria suddenly remembered the gift she had made for him at the craft store. She quickly retrieved it from her bag and handed it to him.

Samuel's eyes lit up with surprise. He hadn't expected her to get him a gift.

"Thank you, Victoria." Samuel opened the box.

Inside was a wooden palette with his name carved into it.

"You made this yourself?" Samuel's eyes sparkled with joy as he held the palette.

Victoria nodded, a bit embarrassed. "After the art competition, you helped clear my name. I didn't know how to thank you, so I made you a gift. I hope you don't mind."

It was her first attempt, so it wasn't perfect, and the colors were plain. But it was heartfelt.

"I love it! I really do!" Samuel looked at her, his eyes filled with warmth.

Victoria sighed in relief. "I'm glad you like it."

As they chatted, a nurse came in to change Samuel's bandages.

Not wanting Victoria to see his wounds, Samuel looked at her awkwardly. "Victoria, you must be hungry. Why don't you go get something to eat?"

Victoria suddenly remembered that neither of them had eaten breakfast. She felt a bit guilty. "I'll go get us some breakfast. There's a new restaurant nearby that has great food."

"Thank you, Victoria."

After Victoria left, the smile on Samuel's face disappeared completely.

###chapter 127 Let's Be Together

Over the next few days, Victoria stayed at the hospital to take care of Samuel. She brought him tea, fetched his medication, and generally acted like a dedicated caregiver.

The only thing she felt too embarrassed to help with was assisting Samuel to the bathroom, so she left that to the hospital staff.

When they had free time, Victoria and Samuel would each take a sketchbook and draw together.

Samuel would give Victoria tips on her technique, and she listened intently, always eager to learn. These peaceful days brought her immense joy.

Victoria even started to think that life should be this simple and pure.

But then her vacation ended, and she had to return to work.

She patiently explained everything to the caregiver who would be taking over.

Samuel watched her quietly as she went over the details with the caregiver.

When she finished, he asked the caregiver to leave before speaking to Victoria. "Victoria, you don't need to worry about me. Just take care of yourself."

Victoria nodded. "You focus on getting better. I'll come visit whenever I can."

"Victoria." Samuel grabbed her arm, looking at her intently. "I..."

Victoria's heart skipped a beat. She quickly pulled her hand back and changed the subject. "I need to go pack. I have work tomorrow."

Samuel gave a bitter smile. "Don't be scared. I just have some good news for you."

Victoria looked puzzled. "What good news?"

Samuel lowered his gaze and said softly, "You've been upset about dropping out of college, right? Because you won the gold medal at the art association last time, I applied for you to take the entrance exam at the University of Aesthetics Shine. If you pass, you'll be a full-fledged student there."

Victoria was stunned. She could hardly believe her ears. "Samuel, is this for real?"

Samuel smiled faintly and held her hand. "Have I ever lied to you?"

Victoria shook her head vigorously. "No!"

Then she seemed to remember something. "But what about my job at Starry Studio Gallery?"

"Don't worry. This entrance exam is for outstanding talents in the community. You just need to take online courses, attend a few mandatory classes on weekends, and pass the exams at the end of the term."

Victoria hugged Samuel tightly, her eyes brimming with excitement. "That's amazing! Thank you, Samuel!"

"You're silly." Samuel ruffled her hair. "You don't need to thank me. I just want you to be happy."

Victoria stared at Samuel.

His handsome face was filled with deep care and affection.

From the beginning, he had always been there for her, looking out for her, thinking of everything.

And she had been wasting her time being sad over William, who never loved her and always mistreated her.

Thinking of this, her eyes reddened, and she felt a sharp pang in her nose. She couldn't help but throw herself into Samuel's arms.

"Samuel, why are you so good to me?"

Feeling the wetness on his chest, Samuel stiffened, then gently patted her back to comfort her. "Don't cry. I hate seeing you cry."

Victoria sniffled, as if making a firm decision. She looked up, trying to hold back her tears. "Samuel, let's be together."

Samuel's eyes widened in disbelief.

His deep voice broke the silence. "Victoria, did you just say..."

Victoria bit her lip and nodded firmly. "Yeah, I want to be with you."

Samuel was taken aback for a moment, then he responded with a bitter smile. "You don't have to be with me just because you feel grateful."

Victoria looked at him steadily and shook her head. "I'm not forcing myself. Besides my dad, you're the only one who truly cares about me and looks out for me."

She paused, her voice a bit hoarse. "You know I once sold myself for money, but you never judged me. You stood by me when I needed help the most. Samuel, if I miss out on you, I'll regret it."

Samuel's eyes darkened as he gazed into Victoria's eyes, remaining silent for a long time.

For a moment, his heart raced inexplicably.

He knew that the connection between Victoria and William wouldn't be easily severed.

But right now, he wanted to take a chance, even if the outcome wasn't what he hoped for.

He slowly pulled Victoria into his arms, his deep voice gentle. "Alright, let's give it a try. If you find that you still don't like me, you can leave anytime, and I won't stop you."

"Okay." Victoria nestled obediently in his arms.

They held each other in silence, neither saying a word.

After a while, Victoria was the first to let go. "I have to go. You get some rest."

"Alright, take care."

Lyanna glanced at William, who was sitting in first class with a dark expression, and cautiously asked Harry, who was sitting next to her, "Harry, what's wrong with William? He looks really upset."

Harry looked at William's grim face.

Of course, he knew what was going on.

His "kitten" had run off to "someone else's house", and it had infuriated him.

But Harry wasn't about to tell Lyanna that! "Probably some tough issues at the company. Don't ask too much."

Lyanna nodded and didn't dare ask more.

Ever since William had confronted her in her room last time, she had been too scared to get close to him.

The plane landed smoothly at Silvermist City International Airport.

William disembarked with a scowl on his face.

He walked out of the airport with a cold expression, not letting Harry follow him. He simply ordered, "Find out what she's been up to since she got back!"

The "she" he referred to was none other than Victoria.

Harry sighed and nodded respectfully. "Yes, Mr. Scott."

Then he got into another car.

Seeing William about to leave, Lyanna hurried after him, asking tentatively, "William, will you take me home?"

William ignored her, flooring the gas pedal.

The black Maybach roared away like a gust of wind.

Lyanna was left standing awkwardly in the cold wind.

She bit her lip, her eyes red as she watched the car speed away.

Before William's car even reached Victoria's building, Harry had already gathered the information.

In Silvermist City, where he worked in the media industry, information was easy to come by.

Tracking Victoria's movements was a piece of cake.

He found out everything, including how Victoria had been diligently taking care of Samuel in the hospital and even the hug they shared in the hospital room.

###chapter 128 Mistress

William listened to Harry's report over the phone, feeling a tightness in his chest that made it hard to breathe.

After hanging up, he threw his phone onto the passenger seat with force, slammed his foot on the gas pedal, and his black Maybach shot through the crowded streets of Silvermist City like an arrow.

Victoria had just walked through the gates of her apartment complex when her phone buzzed. She pulled it out and saw an anonymous email.

Her brow furrowed slightly, a sense of unease washing over her.

She opened the email and saw an attached video file. After a moment of hesitation, she clicked on it.

The video sent a chill down her spine.

In the footage, Lyanna was dragging a suitcase, clearly just off a plane.

Suddenly, an angry mob surrounded her, shouting insults and accusing her of being a homewrecker.

Lyanna's face went pale as she tried to explain, her voice trembling and urgent, "No, it's not like that, you've got it all wrong."

But the furious crowd didn't give her a chance to explain.

Lyanna looked around desperately, searching for an escape, but all she heard were more accusations and insults.

Someone reached out and shoved her hard. Lyanna stumbled, nearly falling.

She struggled to keep her balance, but more hands reached out, pushing her.

"Listen to me, I really didn't..." Lyanna tried to defend herself again, but before she could finish, a slap landed hard on her face.

The crowd's insults grew louder, and someone started tearing at her clothes.

Lyanna screamed, trying to shield herself with her arms, but she was overpowered.

Her coat was ripped open, and her shirt was torn.

"Stop! Please stop!" Lyanna fell to her knees, trying to cover herself with her hands.

Victoria watched the video, feeling a cold chill run through her body.

She stared at the screen, horrified by the violence inflicted on Lyanna.

She knew that with Lyanna's background, there was no way she would be someone's mistress.

This had to be a setup.

And there was only one person crazy enough to do something like this.

But who sent her this email?

She tried replying: [Who are you?]

The response came quickly: [Guess.]

Victoria: [Ella?]

Ella: [You're smart!]

Victoria frowned and replied: [Why did you send this to me?]

Ella: [Wanted to see you scared. How does it feel? Exciting?]

Victoria clenched her fists. [What do you want?]

Ella: [I sent the video, but I didn't do this. You should know who did, right?]

Victoria: [Besides your sister Alice, I can't think of anyone else.]

Ella: [Exactly. I just wanted to show you what that lunatic Alice is capable of. Lyanna was just William's secretary for a few days, but you're different. Be careful.]

With that, Ella closed the email, leaving Victoria with no further response.

Victoria knew Ella wasn't warning her out of kindness. She just wanted to stir up trouble between her and Alice, hoping to benefit from the chaos. But Victoria wasn't foolish enough to charge ahead because of this threat. Alice had become dangerously unhinged. And now that Victoria had decided to be with Samuel, she didn't want to get involved in the mess between Alice, Ella, and William.

Taking a deep breath, Victoria headed home. As soon as she opened the door, she sensed something was off. She turned to run, but a powerful force slammed into her, pinning her against the door. A distinct male scent filled her nostrils, and she looked up to see William towering over her. A strong, oppressive aura emanated from him.

She looked up, meeting William's icy gaze. William stood in the doorway, one hand pinning Victoria against the door, the other holding a cigarette, its tip glowing in the dim light. He wore a light brown sweater, his expression as cold as a winter frost.

He spoke with a chilling tone, "Why are you running?"

Victoria froze, then struggled to break free, but William's grip was too strong. "William, let me go. You're hurting me."

William's deep, raspy voice carried a mocking tone, "Do you know how excited I get every time you say it hurts in bed?"

His breath brushed against Victoria's skin, sending a shiver through her body. Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment, and she gritted her teeth, "William, don't you dare."

William scoffed, "What if I do?"

With that, he hoisted Victoria over his shoulder and strode towards the bedroom. Victoria was terrified, "No! William, put me down! You're crazy, put me down."

She struggled, but William's strength was overwhelming. He threw her onto the soft bed, leaving her dizzy. In the next moment, William was on top of her, one knee pinning her down, his hand gripping her wrists, holding her in place.

His gaze was sharp as a knife, "Victoria, didn't I tell you not to see other men this month? Yet here you are, rushing back from Harborview City to take care of another man."

William's hot breath on her neck made her body heat up. She turned her face away, not answering.

William sneered, "Even a streetwalker has some professional ethics. You have none!"

His words cut deep, and Victoria's eyes filled with tears. She stopped struggling, biting her lip, "Yes, I'm just a whore. Do what you want."

William's eyes narrowed, and he felt an inexplicable irritation seeing her tear-streaked face. He released her wrists, standing up and stepping back. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with a tissue, his expression dark, "You think I want to touch you? You're nothing but a used-up toy to me."

Victoria's tears fell again at his words. She pressed her lips together, saying nothing.

###chapter 129 Her Only Chance

William stared at Victoria's stubborn, restrained expression, feeling an inexplicable anger rise within him.

He walked over and grabbed her chin roughly, his voice harsh as he warned, "You better behave, or when I get tired of you, let's see who'll want you then!"

"Whether anyone wants me or not is none of your business!" Victoria finally spoke, her voice weak, her eyes red and swollen.

He narrowed his eyes and sneered coldly, "You better remember, we're still under contract. If you dare defy me, aren't you afraid I'll take back all the money I gave you?"

Victoria's eyelashes trembled. She looked up at him, biting her lower lip. "If that's what you think, I have nothing more to say."

With that, she lowered her head, unwilling to waste any more words.

Seeing her unyielding attitude, William laughed angrily. "Victoria, you really don't know what's good for you!"

He leaned down and kissed her lips roughly, prying open her teeth with urgency.

Victoria's eyes widened, her pupils contracting.

William showed no mercy, his kiss leaving her lips red and swollen.

She tried to push him away, but he grabbed her wrists tightly.

William let out a cold laugh, increasing his grip. "Victoria, the more you resist, the more I want to take you!"

With that, he flipped her onto the bed.

"William."

Ignoring her, he tore at her shirt, exposing her smooth shoulders.

Victoria pressed her hands against his broad chest, trying to avoid his touch.

"William, don't do this."

He spread her legs, forcing her to kneel on the bed. She twisted and turned, trying to escape his invasion.

Seeing this, William said coldly, "You better behave tonight. My patience is limited."

He then kissed her lips again, ravaging her with intensity.

Victoria felt dizzy from his kiss.

Seeing her dazed expression, William smiled cruelly and removed her last piece of clothing.

The next moment, he entered her without hesitation.

William's movements were forceful.

She bit her lower lip, refusing to make a sound, letting him take what he wanted.

He seemed like a madman, showing no mercy as he tormented her.

Victoria endured his fierce assault, her helpless whimpers the only sound she made.

Her body gradually went limp, lying on the bed, letting William do as he pleased, refusing to beg or resist.

She had long since gotten used to this. She knew better than to expect gentleness from him.

She closed her eyes, tears slowly streaming down her face.

Seeing her tears, William furrowed, his movements suddenly slowing.

Victoria noticed his pause and opened her eyes slightly, meeting his deep gaze.

She stared at him in a daze.

William asked coldly, "Why are you crying? Does being with me make you that miserable?"

With that, he thrust into her a few more times.

Her body tensed instantly.

He shouted, "Scream! Why won't you scream?"

Victoria bit her lower lip hard, refusing to make any sound.

"I'll count to three. If you don't scream, I'll make you stay in this bed all night!"

His tone was icy, devoid of any warmth.

Victoria's tears flowed even more, her body trembling uncontrollably. Her voice was broken. "William, you've helped me many times, and I'm grateful. But I'm only twenty. If it weren't for my dad's accident, I'd still be a student. My first time was with you. We've been together, but do you have to call me a whore every time you're angry? I have feelings, I have dignity too."

As she spoke, her tears flowed like a river, spilling from her eyes.

William was stunned, clearly not expecting Victoria to cry so pitifully.

He frowned, a complex emotion flashing in his eyes. He stared at her small face for a moment, then lost interest and withdrew from her body.

Victoria ran into the bathroom, locking herself inside.

William stood outside, lighting cigarette after cigarette.

The smoke blurred his handsome, devilish features.

Half a pack of cigarettes later, Victoria still hadn't come out.

William kicked open the bathroom door, finding Victoria curled up on the floor, her back against the wall, trembling.

Victoria hugged her arms, refusing to look at him.

He looked down at her, her body covered in marks, her skin cold to the touch.

"You're too old to be sulking like a little girl."

William turned on the shower, washing the marks from her body with warm water.

Victoria's body stiffened. She grabbed his hand on her hip, her voice hoarse. "Get out!"

Ignoring her, William gave her a hot shower, wrapped her up, and put her in bed.

He then found a hairdryer and roughly dried her hair.

His actions filled Victoria with an indescribable sadness and grievance, her tears falling continuously.

Seeing her pitiful state, William sighed, turning her to face him. His deep eyes stared into hers. "Do you really want to be with him?"

He was referring to Samuel, his tone more serious than ever.

Victoria stared at him, trying to understand if he was serious or testing her.

She knew it wasn't just her words that had an effect. William had likely seen the video Ella sent.

Even though Alice had done such things to Lyanna to warn them, he couldn't just give up on her.

Alice was a madwoman.

If they continued their entanglement, who knew what crazy things Alice would do next.

That's why William asked her.

Would she choose to give up her reputation and stay with him, or be with Samuel?

She saw a hint of hope in his eyes. He was waiting for her answer.

This was her only chance.

Victoria thought she would choose the latter without hesitation.

But seeing the hope in William's eyes, she felt a pang of hesitation and struggle.

Even her heart ached a little.

After all their entanglements, now that it was time to sever ties completely, she felt an inexplicable reluctance.

###chapter 130 Who Did It

But when she thought about the video of Lyanna being beaten and humiliated as a mistress, Victoria finally made up her mind.

Lyanna was only falsely accused, but Victoria was indeed the mistress.

Victoria's struggle vanished from her eyes with that thought.

She pressed her lips together and said firmly, "Yes."

William's grip on her body suddenly loosened. After a long silence, a faint, indifferent smile appeared on his lips.

"Alright, since you've made up your mind, I'll grant your wish!"

With that, he turned and walked towards the door.

A loud bang echoed as the door slammed shut.

Victoria stared blankly at the empty bedroom, a thin mist gradually clouding her vision.

He finally agreed to separate from her. She should be happy, right? But somehow, besides happiness, she felt a tinge of sadness.

Victoria couldn't sleep. Early in the morning, she got up and made some soup to take to Samuel at the hospital.

Samuel was still asleep.

The room was quiet, with only him inside.

Victoria gently pushed the door open and walked in, placing the thermos on the counter.

Hearing the noise, Samuel looked up.

When he saw her, his eyes lit up with surprise. "Victoria."

Victoria gave him a reassuring smile and walked to the bedside, speaking softly, "How are you feeling today?"

Samuel smiled and exaggeratedly said, "It hurts so much."

Victoria chuckled, "Stop pretending. It's not that bad."

She opened the thermos.

She poured out the chicken soup and handed it to him, speaking gently, "Have some soup to fill your stomach. We'll do the check-up after you eat."

"Alright!"

He laughed heartily, his smile bright and pure. Victoria, however, felt a faint ache in her heart.

She lowered her eyes, hiding the unusual look in them.

After he finished the soup, Victoria prepared to leave.

Samuel quickly grabbed her hand, "Victoria, tonight..."

Victoria saw his concern and held his hand in return, smiling, "Don't worry. I'll come see you after work. How could a girlfriend leave her boyfriend alone in the hospital?"

Samuel grinned, feeling warm inside, "Alright, I'll wait for you!"

After leaving the hospital, Victoria headed straight to Starry Studio Gallery.

Wendy saw her return and greeted her with a big hug, "Victoria, you're finally back! I missed you so much!"

Victoria smiled and hugged her back, handing her a gift, "I brought you a present. See if you like it."

Wendy's eyes sparkled with excitement as she quickly opened the box.

Inside was a beautiful, exquisite necklace with a unique pendant design, adorned with small pink diamonds that shimmered brightly.

Though not very expensive, it was unique and beautifully crafted.

Wendy loved it immediately, holding the necklace with delight, "Thank you, Victoria!"

Victoria was happy to see her friend pleased, "I'm glad you like it!"

Wendy put the necklace in her bag and pulled Victoria to the desk, speaking seriously, "Victoria, there's something I need to tell you."

"What is it?" Victoria asked, puzzled.

Wendy gritted her teeth, "While you were away, your mom and brother came looking for you almost every day."

Victoria's eyes widened. After the last dramatic scene at the hospital, she had given all the money in her account to Nora and blocked their contacts before leaving on a business trip.

She hadn't expected them to come to Starry Studio Gallery to cause trouble when they couldn't reach her.

Clearly, they were dissatisfied with the few thousand dollars and came to the gallery to demand more.

Victoria unconsciously grabbed Wendy's hand, "Are they still coming?"

Wendy winced in pain and pulled her hand back.

Victoria quickly apologized, "Sorry, Wendy, I didn't mean to hurt you."

She didn't know why she had hurt Wendy; she hadn't used much force.

"It's okay! It's not your fault." Wendy shook her head and continued, "Don't worry. I told your mom and brother that you were fired. They didn't believe it at first and came looking for you for over half a month. They didn't see you, so they finally believed it. They haven't come in the past few days. But you should still be prepared. They won't give up easily."

Victoria pressed her lips together, her hands clenched tightly.

They hadn't given up and still wanted to exploit her.

She thought for a moment and said, "Alright, I'll be careful."

After their conversation, Victoria was about to get some water when she noticed bruises on Wendy's wrist.

Remembering Wendy's earlier wince, Victoria's eyes narrowed. She quickly lifted Wendy's sleeve.

Sure enough, there were red and purple bruises all over her arm.

"What happened? Who did this?" Victoria frowned.

"It's nothing!" Wendy hurriedly pulled her sleeve back down, explaining, "I accidentally hit the wall! It's no big deal!"

Afraid Victoria might misunderstand, she added, "I'm really fine, Victoria. Don't worry."

Victoria's face turned cold, "That's impossible. Who are you trying to fool? These are clearly finger marks, not from hitting a wall. Who did this?"

Wendy's face turned pale instantly.

Seeing her friend's pale face, Victoria became more determined. She gritted her teeth, "Tell me who did this. I'll get revenge for you!"

She wouldn't allow anyone to bully her friend. She would fight to the end if necessary.

"Victoria, I'm really fine!" Wendy forced a bitter smile, which looked worse than crying, "Go to work. Don't waste too much time."

"You won't tell me?" Victoria took out her phone and dialed a few numbers, "If you don't tell me, I'll call the police!"

"No!" Wendy was terrified and quickly stopped Victoria, pleading, "Please don't call the police. I'll tell you!"

Victoria put her phone away, raising an eyebrow for her to continue.

"It was my mom!" Wendy murmured, lowering her head.

"Your mom? Your biological mom?" Victoria's eyes widened in shock. She hadn't expected it to be Wendy's mother.

Then she asked, "Why did she hit you?"

Wendy smiled bitterly, "Because she needs me to bring my father back home!"

###chapter 131 We're Family

Victoria frowned and asked, "What do you mean?"

Wendy spoke with a hint of sadness, "My dad's got a mistress, so he barely comes home anymore. Only if I'm sick or hurt."

Victoria was completely stunned.

After a moment, she asked again, "So your mom makes you sick or hurt on purpose to get your dad to come home?"

Wendy nodded bitterly, "Yeah, I can't eat peanuts, but she puts them in my food and tells my dad I was craving them. Sometimes she even pours oil on the bathroom floor to make me slip and fall."

Victoria was furious, slamming the table in anger, "How can your mom be so cruel to her own daughter?"

She could hardly believe a mother could treat her daughter this way.

Suddenly, Victoria laughed at herself, thinking of Nora.

They say motherly love is instinctive, but some mothers just don't have it for their daughters.

Victoria held Wendy's hand, asking with concern, "But you're grown up now, why don't you leave your mom and live on your own?"

Wendy looked up, tears streaming down her cheeks, "Victoria, I can't leave home."

Victoria was taken aback and tentatively asked, "Is it because your mom won't let you move out?"

Wendy lowered her eyes and nodded, "She has severe depression. If I leave, I can't imagine what would happen. No matter how badly she treats me, she's still my mother who gave birth to and raised me. I can't just watch her die."

Tears glistened in Wendy's eyes as she finished speaking.

Victoria was silent for a moment, then comforted her, "There has to be a way."

But looking at the injuries on Wendy's hands, she felt helpless.

This situation seemed impossible to resolve. How could it be fixed?

Victoria was still deep in thought when she left work.

Samuel noticed her troubled expression and asked with concern, "Victoria, is something wrong?"

Victoria sighed and said helplessly, "It's nothing."

After all, it was Wendy's family matter, and she didn't feel right spreading it around.

Seeing that she didn't want to talk about it, Samuel didn't press further and changed the subject, "Remember I told you about the University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam?"

Victoria nodded, "Of course I remember."

Samuel smiled slightly, "I confirmed with the school today. The exam is in three months, at the start of the spring semester. You need to be prepared!"

Hearing this, Victoria's face lit up with excitement, "Great! What subjects will be tested?"

"Basic reading and writing, math for sure, and then sketching, watercolor, and quick drawing. Additionally, because it's a special admission, there's also an art appreciation test."

Victoria carefully noted down each subject Samuel mentioned.

She had always been a good student, and although she hadn't been in school for two years, she regularly read academic materials. Reading and writing wouldn't be a problem.

Math might be a bit challenging, though. She needed to find a way to improve.

Seeing Victoria's eager expression, Samuel chuckled, "Feeling confident?"

"I'm not worried about the other subjects, just math. But I don't have time to attend a tutoring class," Victoria said, troubled.

Samuel smiled, "I'm pretty good at math. If I hadn't pursued art, I might have become a math teacher. How about I tutor you?"

Victoria's eyes lit up, and she nodded eagerly, "Sure!" Then she hesitated and asked, "But with your busy schedule, how will you have time to tutor me?"

"I only have two classes a day, so I have plenty of free time. Besides, you're my girlfriend now. I'd love to spend more time with you!" Samuel said, his joy evident.

Victoria blushed, shyly agreeing, "Okay, then I'll come to the hospital after work for tutoring."

"Sounds good," Samuel replied with a warm smile.

For the next few days, Victoria's routine was working at Starry Studio Gallery during the day and going to the hospital for tutoring after work.

This continued for a week, and today Samuel was being discharged from the hospital.

Victoria packed up her things after work, ready to go to the hospital to help with his discharge.

But as soon as she stepped out of Starry Studio Gallery, someone blocked her path.

Startled, Victoria instinctively took a step back.

"Victoria, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere else to chat?" the man said.

Victoria frowned, looking at the man standing in front of her, "Bobby, what is there left to say between us?"

Bobby stared at Victoria, a slight smile playing on his lips as if he had expected her refusal, "I've arranged to go abroad. I'll be leaving in a month. Before I go, Mom wants us to have a family dinner."

Victoria's expression grew complicated as she looked at Bobby.

Seeing her hesitation, Bobby continued, "I know Mom and I have done a lot of wrong things to you, but I hope you can consider that we're family and that Mom is seriously ill. Please grant her this wish."

Victoria pressed her lips together and finally agreed.

Bobby smiled in satisfaction and led Victoria to a mansion.

Looking at the luxurious mansion, Victoria asked in confusion, "Where is this?"

Bobby forced a smile and said nonchalantly, "This is a property Mom bought."

Victoria was taken aback, then let out a sarcastic laugh.

She had always wondered why Nora and Bobby, despite getting so much money from Ella and Alice by exploiting her, kept crying and asking her for more money. Now she knew they had secretly bought such a big house.

Meanwhile, she had been living in a small rental, struggling to pay for their medical and tuition fees, and relying on the subway and bus for her daily commute.

How ironic!

Victoria let out a cold laugh and followed Bobby into the house.

The interior was lavishly decorated, no less grand than their previous home.

Nora was sitting in the living room.

The moment she saw Victoria, a cold glint flashed in Nora's eyes but quickly disappeared.

Nora spoke gently, "Victoria, you're here. Come in and sit."

Victoria glanced at Nora indifferently, said nothing, and walked in to sit on the couch.

Nora looked at her and said softly, "Victoria, where have you been these days? We've been looking for you so many times but couldn't find you."

Hearing this, Victoria felt a surge of disgust.

She looked at Nora coldly and retorted, "Where I am is none of your business. Are you still trying to ask me for money? Didn't I tell you that the money in that account was all I had?"

A flash of anger crossed Nora's eyes, but she quickly smiled and said, "What are you talking about? We're family. Isn't it natural to help each other?"

###chapter 132 Confinement

Hearing this, Victoria's heart ached deeply. She fought back the urge to cry, gritting her teeth. "Mom, what more do you want from me? I don't owe you anything. Stop using 'family' to guilt-trip me!"

Nora's face twisted with rage, her fingers trembling as she pointed at Victoria. "Victoria, don't forget, I'm your mother! Without me, you wouldn't be here! How dare you speak to me like that? Watch how I teach you a lesson!"

Before she finished speaking, she raised her hand and slapped Victoria hard across the face.

The sharp sound of the slap echoed through the living room. Victoria clutched her burning right cheek, staring blankly at Nora, then stood up to leave.

Bobby quickly stepped in, holding Nora back and whispering, "Mom, what are you doing? We invited Victoria here for a family reunion today."

He emphasized "reunion," which seemed to calm Nora down a bit.

Nora took a deep breath, steadying herself, and spoke softly, "I just got too emotional. Are you okay? Does it hurt?"

Bobby also tried to soothe Victoria, "Victoria, you know Mom's health isn't great. Don't hold it against her. We're about to leave Silvermist City and go abroad. Let's not argue and just have a nice family meal."

Victoria's eyes stung with unshed tears.

Bobby gently coaxed her towards the dining room.

The table was laden with a feast, including several of her favorite dishes.

Victoria's anger slowly dissipated. She forced a smile and sat down next to Bobby.

Seeing this, Nora's expression softened considerably.

Once all the dishes were served, Bobby picked up a piece of fish and placed it in Victoria's bowl. "Here, Victoria, try your favorite fried fish."

Victoria hesitated for a moment but eventually took it and ate.

A glint of something flashed in Bobby's eyes, gone in an instant.

The meal was tasteless, and no one spoke much.

Victoria ate in silence, not noticing that Bobby and Nora hadn't touched any of her favorite dishes.

Nora watched Victoria eat with a cold smile, a flash of malice in her eyes, but it was quickly hidden.

Victoria had only eaten a little when she suddenly felt dizzy. She frowned, rubbing her forehead, feeling her head grow heavier.

Victoria propped her head up, trying to keep her eyes open, looking at Bobby, who was smiling at her strangely with a glass of wine in hand.

A chill ran down Victoria's spine. She tried to get up and run, but her body felt weak and unresponsive.

Bobby's smile widened in triumph. "Victoria, don't struggle. Just have a good sleep."

Victoria shook her head desperately, trying to stay awake, but no matter how hard she tried, she fell into unconsciousness.

Samuel waited at the hospital, but Victoria never showed up.

This wasn't like her. If something had come up, she would have called.

A sense of foreboding filled Samuel. He pulled out his phone and dialed Victoria's number.

The phone rang endlessly, and Samuel's brow furrowed.

Unwilling to give up, he called again, with the same result.

He called Starry Studio Gallery and learned she had left work hours ago.

A strong sense of unease gripped Samuel. Something must have happened to Victoria.

But with his right leg unable to support him, he could only call Ryan, asking him to send people to look for her.

Meanwhile, William also received news of Victoria's disappearance.

His face darkened immediately, and he ordered Harry to find her as soon as possible.

After hanging up, William walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, staring into the dark night sky, his brows knitted in worry.

Even though Victoria had distanced herself from him, he wouldn't allow anyone to harm her.

Remembering the pain while digging her out of the ground before, William's fists clenched tightly, his knuckles turning white.

He would not let Victoria be hurt again!

When Victoria woke up, it was already noon the next day.

Nora had miscalculated the dosage, giving her too much sleeping medication.

Victoria groggily opened her eyes, momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar surroundings.

She tried to rub her aching head but found her hand shackled by a long chain, securing her to the room.

Victoria let out a bitter laugh. Of course, it had come to this.

But she had to play her part convincingly!

Victoria feigned terror, struggling to free herself from the chains, but it was futile.

She pounded on the door, shouting, "Help! Let me out! Let me out now!"

The loud banging echoed through the room.

After a while, she heard the sound of a key turning in the lock, followed by the door opening.

Nora and Bobby stood in the doorway.

Seeing Victoria awake, Nora smiled and walked slowly towards her.

Victoria looked at them in disbelief, her eyes wary. "Mom, what are you doing? I'm your daughter! You drugged me and locked me up!"

She had thought their betrayal and threats were the worst they could do, but now they had resorted to kidnapping and confinement.

Nora sneered, "You defied me."

Bobby chimed in, "I told you last time, give me more money, and I won't bother you again. But there was only a couple of thousand dollars in the account. Is that really all you have? You tricked me, so don't blame me for being ruthless!"

Victoria shouted angrily, "Bobby, you know how much Mom's medical bills cost, and Dad's debts-William paid for all of it! It's too shamelessly to ask for more. I have no money now!"

Bobby's face darkened, his eyes cold as he glared at Victoria. "I had to drop out of the University of Aesthetics Shine and go abroad because of you! Fine, I believe you have no money. But you know how much it costs to go abroad, and you could have found a way to get it. Why didn't you?"

"You're a jerk! I should never have helped you! You falsely accused me, and now it's my fault?" she snapped back.

###chapter 133 Mutual Destruction

Victoria's face flushed with anger, her chest heaving violently.

Nora stepped in, trying to defuse the situation. "Victoria, Bobby needs to go abroad for his studies. As his sister, shouldn't you be thinking about him? Just ask William for more money, and we'll let you go right away. You know William spoils you; if you ask, he'll definitely give it to you."

Victoria's chest rose and fell with fury. "William has never liked me, let alone spoiled me! Stop dreaming. He won't give it!"

Nora's eyes narrowed, her tone suddenly sharp. "Victoria, are you forcing me to use other means to make you comply?"

Victoria wasn't afraid of her threats. "You wouldn't dare! Do you want to send your precious son to jail?"

"Of course, I dare. I'm your mother. Whether I scold you, hit you, or even send you to a mental hospital, it's not illegal! You'd better behave, or don't blame me for being ruthless."

A chill ran through Victoria. She had never seen a mother as cruel and vicious as Nora.

"Mom, you can't do this to me!" Victoria screamed hysterically.

Nora glanced at Victoria coldly and sneered, "It's because you're too stingy, not even helping your own brother!"

A deep sense of helplessness surged within Victoria. Nora's tactics were too despicable, leaving her with no way to fight back.

She took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down.

She couldn't afford to get agitated now, or she would be even more at their mercy.

Victoria closed her eyes, slowly calming her emotions before reopening them. She looked at Nora and Bobby with indifference, her voice hoarse. "Fine, I'll ask him for money. How much do you want?"

Victoria's sudden change in attitude caught Bobby and Nora off guard.

They exchanged glances, and Bobby quickly said, "Twenty million dollars!"

"Twenty million dollars?" Victoria gasped, then scoffed. "You're really asking for the moon!"

Bobby sneered at Victoria, speaking as if it were only natural. "For people like them, twenty million dollars is nothing. Besides, studying abroad costs hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Will you care about me in the future? I have to ask for more at once. And twenty million dollars is already a bargain for you. After all, you're his mistress. William wouldn't want to shortchange you, right?"

"You're shameless and greedy. How could I have a brother like you!" Victoria was so furious that her chest heaved even more violently.

Seeing Victoria's reaction, Bobby angrily rushed over, grabbed her collar, and slapped her hard across the face.

Victoria was thrown to the ground, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.

Bobby wasn't done. He grabbed Victoria's hair, threatening her viciously. "Bitch, if you don't get the twenty million dollars, I'll lock you up until you die!"

Victoria clutched her scalp in pain, her anger erupting like a volcano.

She forgot her original plans and schemes. She had had enough of their threats and torment. At this moment, she only wanted to take them down with her!

She suddenly got up, wrapping the chain around Bobby's neck and pulling with all her might. "Even if I die, I'll take you with me!"

Nora screamed in terror, "Victoria! Let go!"

Bobby was stunned by Victoria's sudden action but quickly started struggling desperately.

"Let go, you psycho! When I get my hands on you, you'll wish you were dead!" Bobby gasped, his face turning red.

Victoria couldn't believe he was still threatening her at this point!

Her eyes were bloodshot, and she gritted her teeth, pulling the chain tighter, wanting to strangle him.

Bobby began to feel breathless, his body weakening, and his vision blurring.

Nora's face turned pale with fear, shouting, "Victoria, let go! You'll kill him!"

Victoria ignored her, not loosening her grip at all.

Seeing Victoria's determination, Nora panicked. She grabbed a nearby bottle and smashed it over Victoria's head.

The sound of the bottle shattering echoed through the room. Victoria felt a hot sensation on her head, blood streaming down her face, blurring her vision.

Victoria finally let go, collapsing weakly to the ground.

Bobby coughed violently, spitting out a mouthful of water.

He kicked Victoria over and over again. "Damn it! You bitch! How dare you hurt me! I'll cripple you today!"

Victoria lay on the ground, letting Bobby kick her. She stared at the ceiling, feeling empty and desolate inside.

She didn't cry or scream, lying there quietly like a soulless shell, unresponsive to Bobby's beating.

'Bobby, Nora, you forced me to this.' 

Suddenly, the door was kicked open, and a swarm of police officers rushed in.

Bobby was taken out of the villa, surrounded by flashing cameras that nearly blinded him.

He stared wide-eyed in terror, his hands cuffed in front of him, red marks on his wrists. His legs trembled so much that he could barely move without the police's support.

It wasn't until he was shoved into the police car that he snapped out of it, screaming, "I didn't do it! I'm being framed! Someone set me up!"

Bobby was taken away, and the reporters followed him to the police station.

William leaned against his Maybach, the cigarette in his fingers glowing and fading, casting sharp shadows on his face. He watched the commotion at the villa gradually die down, then stubbed out his cigarette and floored the gas pedal, crashing through the police barricade.

"Mr. Scott, you can't go in."

He rolled down the window, tugging at his tie, his eyes cold as ice. "I'm the victim's family."

The warehouse door creaked open, the smell of mold and blood hitting him.

William's pupils contracted.

Victoria crouched in the corner, her ankle raw and bloody from the chain, her forehead wound crudely bandaged.

She held a cup of water, sipping it slowly.

He shrugged off his coat, striding over to wrap it around her trembling body, his voice tight with suppressed rage. "You risked your life to make them pay?"

"Life?" She suddenly grabbed his collar, her nails digging into his skin. "They framed me, humiliated me, and took my money, and I could overlook all of it!"

Her eyes burned with madness. "But they shouldn't have deceived my father. Bobby isn't even my dad's child."

###chapter 134 Setting a Trap

Tears streamed down her face, staining his expensive shirt with blotchy marks.

"What?" William's frown deepened. He reached out to wipe the tears from her cheeks, his voice gentle, "Come on, get up."

Victoria shook her head, her gaze distant as she murmured, "I always wondered why my mom hated me so much. Then your aunt told me that my parents had a huge fight about a divorce over a decade ago. I started digging and found out my mom had been cheating. Bobby is her child with that man. She stayed married to my dad only for the money. My dad knew about her infidelity, but she used my custody to threaten him, so he never divorced her."

She choked up, her eyes brimming with tears, as if recalling something painfully despairing.

William's heart clenched, his dark eyes fixed on her.

Victoria continued, tears falling like broken pearls, "They treated my dad and me like fools."

So, even though she knew Bobby had bad intentions, she still followed him into their trap.

She had already contacted Elara's son, Robert, to have him report to the police as a lawyer the next day.

It was all her plan; she should have been happy.

Victoria laughed bitterly, hysterically, her eyes full of despair, "It didn't have to end this way."

William couldn't stand seeing her like this. He leaned down and hugged her frail shoulders, his deep voice comforting, "They got what they deserved."

Her body stiffened, then she slowly lifted her head, her clear eyes staring at William with a complex emotion.

Victoria looked at William's handsome face and smiled bitterly, "I've become just as despicable as them. It's really frustrating!"

Scheming, setting traps-how was she any different from Bobby and Nora?

Imprisonment, extortion, intentional harm-Bobby's life was ruined.

William just looked at her, understanding all her thoughts and emotions.

Suddenly, he stepped forward and pulled her into his arms.

Victoria trembled, slowly raising her hands to wrap around his waist, holding tighter and tighter.

"Victoria!"

A scream came from the doorway. Nora, disheveled and haggard, rushed in. Seeing Victoria, her eyes flared with anger, and she raised her hand to strike.

William's eyes flashed coldly, and he quickly grabbed her hand, forcefully pushing it aside.

Harry arrived with others, hurriedly restraining the out-of-control Nora.

Due to her severe illness, she hadn't been arrested but was under house arrest for medical treatment.

Nora lost her balance and fell to the ground. She tried to get up twice but couldn't, and she shouted at Victoria with hatred, "Victoria, why did you do this? He's your brother! Your own brother! He was my pride and hope! Why did you destroy him?"

Nora cried hysterically, completely losing her usual composure, struggling like a mad beast. "You've ruined our lives. I hate you! I hate you!"

Victoria stood frozen, staring blankly at Nora's hysterical curses.

"Victoria, how can you be so cruel? I beg you to spare Bobby, okay? I'm begging you. He did nothing wrong! Kill me instead, let me take his place, okay?" Nora's voice trembled, her eyes full of pleading. She crawled on the ground, clutching Victoria's leg, desperately begging, "Victoria, I know I wronged you before, but now, I beg you to spare Bobby, please!"

Victoria looked at Nora kneeling at her feet, her eyes stinging, hot tears sliding down her cheeks.

She tilted her head back, closing her eyes, her throat dry, "Even now, you still want to lie to me? He's not even my dad's child."

Nora froze, not expecting Victoria to know.

Then, veins bulged on her forehead, and she pointed at Victoria, cursing angrily, "The biggest regret of my life is giving birth to you, you jinx! Why don't you just die? Die!"

Victoria's heart felt hollow, a faint pain spreading.

William turned his head, coldly looking at Nora on the ground. "Take her out."

As soon as he spoke, he felt a force around his waist. Victoria's hands were tightly wrapped around him.

He looked down at Victoria, seeing her use all her strength, her voice faint but firm, "Don't hurt her."

William's brows furrowed, feeling both helpless and compassionate towards Victoria's kindness.

Nora was her biological mother, so what?

All these years, when had Nora ever truly cared for her?

When she needed support the most, Nora only knew how to take from her, never considering her tough situation.

She was so young, yet she bore the family's burdens alone.

And Nora? Not only did she not give her any warmth, but she also hurt her so recklessly, which made William incredibly angry.

But despite his anger, William signaled to Harry.

Harry understood and didn't make things difficult for Nora.

Nora seemed to suddenly realize, trying to grab William, but Harry immediately stepped in to stop her.

"William! Don't forget, she's Alvin's daughter, the root of all this! Why are you helping her?"

William lowered his gaze, looking at Victoria in his arms.

Yes, she was Alvin's daughter. He hadn't forgotten.

But so what?

Right now, all he wanted was to protect her, to keep her from any more harm.

"Take her back to the hospital!" William ordered Harry.

"Yes." Harry obeyed.

Nora shouted unwillingly, "William! How can you help her? Her father"

"Shut her up!" William commanded coldly, his gaze chilling.

Harry immediately moved, gagging Nora and dragging her out.

Victoria watched Nora, who kept cursing her, gradually disappear, and tears fell uncontrollably.

William's heart ached. He bent down, holding Victoria close to his chest, patting her back, his voice soft, "Don't cry, sweetheart."

Victoria leaned on his shoulder, smelling the faint scent of tobacco on him, feeling a sharp sting in her nose.

She sobbed, her voice hoarse as she apologized, "I'm sorry for troubling you again."

William sighed, shaking his head, wiping the tears from her cheeks.

Victoria was too kind, always bullied without fighting back.

He gently wiped her tear stains, speaking softly, "No more crying from now on."

Victoria sniffled, her nose red and swollen, nodding.

He held her hand, leading her out of the room. Suddenly, Victoria felt the world spinning.

She finally couldn't hold on, her body going limp, collapsing into William's arms.

Seeing her faint, William's face changed drastically. He quickly bent down, lifting her in his arms, and hurried out the door.

###chapter 135 Kidney Transplant

As he held her, he was stunned by how frail she had become, her body feeling almost weightless.

He cradled her gently, afraid that even the slightest pressure might hurt her.

Victoria was rushed to the hospital, and it was only then that William learned about the various tortures she had endured while being held captive.

Her ankle wound, untreated for too long, had become severely infected. She had multiple soft tissue injuries, and a heavy blow to her forehead might leave a scar. The concussion she suffered was also quite serious.

Looking at the unconscious Victoria on the hospital bed, William's eyes were as cold as ice, his entire presence radiating a chilling aura.

He knew she had chosen this path herself, but he couldn't suppress the fury burning inside him.

No one who hurt her would escape unscathed.

Since she had suffered so much, he would make sure Bobby and Nora paid a heavy price!

"Get that house under Nora's name transferred to Victoria," William ordered Harry in a low voice.

Harry was momentarily stunned. "Mr. Scott, you mean...?"

"The money for that house came from framing Victoria. It rightfully belongs to her. As for how to get Nora to agree, figure it out."

William's tone was calm, as if he were discussing something trivial.

Harry understood and nodded.

After a night of treatment, Victoria felt much better.

The door to her hospital room slowly opened, and a figure appeared in the doorway.

Victoria looked up and saw Samuel.

Samuel, in a wheelchair, struggled to push himself to her bedside. He looked at Victoria's pale face, his eyes flickering with emotion.

His assistant placed a thermos on the table and opened it, revealing steaming oatmeal.

Samuel quietly watched Victoria for a moment before speaking. "I brought you some oatmeal. You should eat a little."

Victoria nodded slightly and said softly, "Thanks, Samuel."

A bitter smile appeared on Samuel's lips. "Why didn't you contact me first? I had to hear about it from your colleagues."

Victoria lowered her head, feeling a bit guilty. "I just didn't want to worry you."

"But you could contact William?" Samuel's tone was tinged with dissatisfaction and hurt.

Victoria quickly explained, "No, I contacted Elara's son, Robert. I didn't reach out to William; he came on his own."

Samuel took a deep breath, a hint of self-mockery flashing across his face. "You thought of others but not me."

"It's not like that, Samuel. Please don't misunderstand..."

"Just eat something first." Samuel interrupted her, his mood low, but he still carefully serving the oatmeal and handing it to Victoria.

Victoria took the oatmeal, feeling a bit uneasy.

She hadn't contacted Samuel because she didn't want to burden him. The situation she was involved in was complicated, and she would feel even more guilty if he got dragged into it.

But now, she felt like she had indeed hurt him.

Samuel watched Victoria's thoughtful expression, then turned slightly to face her directly. "Victoria, you said you wanted to be with me."

Victoria had no response. She had let him down.

"But when you were in danger, you didn't think of me first and kept me in the dark. Do you know how much that hurt? It shows that I'm not important enough to you, that I haven't done enough to make you trust me."

Victoria hurried to explain, "It's really not what you think. I was just so panicked at the time, only thinking about how to escape. I didn't consider everything."

"So, you didn't intentionally ignore me?"

"Of course not, Samuel. You mean a lot to me."

Samuel looked into Victoria's sincere eyes and nodded. "Alright, I believe you."

Victoria breathed a sigh of relief but still felt a bit uneasy.

Samuel chatted with Victoria for a while, and the conversation turned to her family.

"What are you going to do about your mom?" Samuel asked.

Victoria's eyes dimmed. "I don't know. She's always hated me. This incident might make her hate me even more."

Samuel hesitated before saying, "I heard her condition has worsened. She might need a kidney transplant."

Victoria's hand trembled slightly as she looked up at him.

"If they can't find a suitable donor, they'll have to look for a match among relatives. Your mom doesn't have other close relatives, so..."

"It's just me and Bobby," Victoria said calmly.

She had anticipated this outcome long ago.

In fact, she had already decided that if there was no other way, she would give one of her kidneys to her mother.

Samuel sat nearby, his brows furrowed, his gaze fixed on Victoria's face, wanting to speak but holding back.

Nora had always been harsh on her, often withholding the care she deserved. But blood ties were hard to sever, and how could he persuade her to give up on saving Nora?

If he were in her shoes, he wouldn't be able to make such a choice either.

However, Victoria seemed particularly serene, showing little worry. She said lightly, "If it really comes to that, maybe it would be a kind of release for me."

She felt that the suffering she had endured over the years was like a long journey of repaying debts.

If she could repay Nora's debt of raising her with her kidney, it might be a good ending.

Samuel's hospital was elsewhere, and the on-duty doctor had called several times urging him to return.

He wheeled himself forward a few steps, then suddenly stopped and turned back, hugging Victoria tightly, his arms closing around her.

Victoria stiffened, letting him hold her. After a moment, she reached out and hugged him back.

Samuel's voice sounded in her ear, "Victoria, I'm your boyfriend. You need to learn to rely on me. I'll always be there for you."

Hearing this, Victoria felt a warmth in her heart, her eyes moistening.

Yes, since she had chosen to be with him, she should forget the past and start anew.

She closed her eyes, trying to hold back her tears. "Thank you, Samuel."

Samuel pulled away and tucked her in. "Get some rest."

"Okay, be careful on your way back," Victoria reminded him.

Samuel nodded and gave her a bright smile.

Just then, the door opened.

It was William.

He held a document in his hand and saw the intimate embrace between the two. His eyes instantly turned cold.

Samuel looked at him, seemingly oblivious to his dark expression, and smiled. "Mr. Scott, thanks for bringing my Victoria to the hospital."

He emphasized "my Victoria."

William glanced at Victoria, then regained his composure, his indifferent gaze shifting to Samuel. "It was nothing."

"Victoria, I'll see you tomorrow," Samuel said.

Victoria nodded, watching Samuel leave.

William stood by, his face growing darker, the air around him thick with an oppressive tension.

After Samuel left, the room became eerily quiet. Victoria swallowed nervously, sneaking a glance at William.

She noticed his fists clenched at his sides, his nails digging into his palms.

Victoria's heart tightened, feeling inexplicably guilty.

"Do you love him?" William suddenly asked, his voice icy, as if laced with shards of ice.

Victoria, feeling guilty, avoided his gaze and stammered, "He's my boyfriend. Of course, I love him."

William stared at Victoria, his pupils contracting, a surge of anger igniting within him.

###chapter 136 But I Love You

Victoria felt the intensity of his gaze, and fear crept into her heart. She instinctively took a step back, hiding behind the hospital bed.

William saw the fear and panic in Victoria's eyes, and a dull ache passed through his heart.

He struggled to control the anger and bitterness churning inside him, speaking as gently and slowly as he could, "What about me?"

Victoria froze, lifting her head in confusion to meet his dark eyes.

"What do we mean to each other?" he asked.

"I..." Victoria opened her mouth but couldn't form a complete sentence.

William stepped closer, his large hand gripping Victoria's chin, forcing her to look directly at him.

"Speak. Say you like me," William commanded forcefully.

Victoria's eyelashes fluttered, a thousand thoughts racing through her mind, finally condensing into one sentence: "William, you know it's impossible between us."

William took a deep breath, the anger in his chest nearly exploding. His arm muscles tensed, veins bulging, and his temple throbbed.

"But I love you," he said hoarsely, revealing the words he'd kept hidden in his heart for so long.

Tears welled up in Victoria's eyes, streaming down her pale, dry cheeks.

She never thought she would hear him confess his love to her one day.

She always believed he would never say he loved her.

William's heart softened as he saw her cry. He leaned down and kissed her tears, the salty taste filling his mouth.

William's movements were gentle, and Victoria gradually stopped resisting. She closed her eyes, letting the tears fall.

How could she not know his feelings for her?

But there were too many obstacles between them, too deep.

Ella, Alice, and her father, Alvin-each one was a stumbling block between them.

Sensing her acquiescence, William deepened his gaze. He lowered his head and kissed Victoria's swollen, pink lips from crying.

Victoria's eyes widened, and she struggled to push him away.

But William's strength was too great; Victoria couldn't resist at all.

"Let go," Victoria whimpered, needing to breathe.

"Don't call out, or you'll bring the doctors and nurses here. Do you want us to be embarrassed?" William whispered in her ear, with a hint of coaxing.

Victoria immediately fell silent, looking at him pitifully.

Seeing this, William's eyes burned with intensity. He kissed her slender neck, leaving intimate red marks.

His kisses grew deeper, his breathing becoming more rapid, his hand slipping under her clothes.

"No!" Victoria's soft moan escaped, her body going limp.

William's body tensed even more, his lips pressing against her skin, leaving his unique mark on her, ensuring she would always remember his presence.

Victoria was on the verge of losing her sanity from his teasing.

"William, stop," she pleaded, squirming.

Instead of stopping, William became even more brazen.

His kisses trailed down her neck, finally landing on her chest, sucking and leaving vivid red marks.

Victoria's body trembled, a wave of numbness spreading through her, making her moan uncontrollably.

William's voice was low and husky, seductive enough to captivate, "Say my name."

"William!" Victoria's voice was tinged with desire.

"Say it again," William urged, his hands not pausing for a moment.

Victoria had completely lost the ability to think. Her already sensitive body became weak under his teasing, her back arching, one leg wrapping around his waist, allowing him to take what he wanted.

"William!" Victoria called his name softly, her tone filled with intense longing.

"Keep saying it," William's voice grew even deeper and raspier.

"William!" Victoria whispered, wrapping her arms around William's neck.

Sensing her response, William's eyes flashed with a fiery light.

He suddenly flipped her over, pressing Victoria beneath him, proving his decision with his actions.

William kissed Victoria's soft lips dominantly, his hands skillfully unbuttoning her hospital gown.

He had never been so crazed in his desire, wanting to consume Victoria entirely.

William's tall, muscular body exuded a deadly charm with every curve.

His large hands deftly removed all her restraints, entering her body without hesitation.

He lowered his head, burying it in her chest, sucking hard on her soft, full breasts.

It had been a long time, and Victoria's body felt some pain. She frowned, groaning softly.

William looked up, seeing her furrowed brows, his eyes filled with worry, his heart aching.

He reached out, gently smoothing the wrinkles between her brows, his voice soft, "Does it hurt?"

Victoria shook her head, gritting her teeth to endure his rough invasion, tears welling up in her eyes.

"I'm sorry," his voice was thick with emotion, "Victoria, I'm sorry, I can't control myself."

His words hit her heart like a heavy blow, and Victoria froze.

"In this lifetime, I'll only be like this with you," William cupped her face, his lips brushing her soft ear, speaking hoarsely.

Victoria's body instantly stiffened, tears welling up again.

Seeing her cry, William panicked, quickly grabbing tissues to wipe her tears, "Victoria, please don't cry."

Victoria slowly opened her tear-filled eyes, gazing at his handsome face.

She didn't want to admit it, but even knowing he was just acting on impulse, she couldn't help but feel moved.

But there were too many things between them.

Victoria lowered her eyes, her rationality gradually returning.

She stared at William for a long time before speaking hoarsely, "I'm sorry, William, I'm Samuel's girlfriend now, we can't..."

Before she could finish, William's anger flared.

He lifted one of Victoria's legs, hooking it around his waist, thrusting in hard.

William's well-built body moved with precision, his teeth grazing Victoria's earlobe, sweat dripping from the intense pleasure, "Victoria, you still owe me a few days from our month together, you have to make it up."

Victoria's struggles were futile, his large member filling her completely, the folds of her inner walls stretching to accommodate him, the fullness spreading from her tailbone to her brain, making her arch her back, exposing her long neck, and letting out soft moans.

William gripped her slender waist, thrusting forward, his member plunging into her with each movement, pulling out completely before disappearing again.

Victoria was tormented, her cheeks flushed, her delicate body arching, "William!"

William couldn't bear to let her go, capturing her small mouth, kissing her passionately.

Victoria felt like she was on a roller coaster, her world spinning.

William didn't stop, wave after wave of intense pleasure crashing over her.

He stood, thrusting upward, his thick member like a giant snake, entering her deeply.

Victoria felt her waist sink, her upper body arching back, her back forming a beautiful curve.

Victoria clung to the bedsheet, her nails digging in, leaving five clear marks.

The intense pleasure overwhelmed her nerves, making her moan softly.

###chapter 137 I Will Fulfill Your Wish

William's large hand gripped Victoria's chest as he thrust into her with increasing intensity. Victoria let out a scream before succumbing to the wave of pleasure that washed over her.

He couldn't help but quicken his pace, while Victoria was nearly melting, her soft, breathy moans more arousing than the filthiest words.

William was nearing his limit, feeling himself losing control.

His strong waist muscles tensed, his leg muscles bulged, and sweat dripped down his body.

As he climaxed, he held Victoria tightly against him, his hot member pulsing inside her.

Afterwards, their naked bodies lay intertwined on the bed, Victoria's face flushed a deep red.

William lay on top of her, gently kissing her face.

Suddenly, Victoria's phone rang, pulling her back to reality.

It was Samuel, her boyfriend.

Victoria's face turned pale, the images of her and William's entanglement still vivid in her mind.

She felt utterly despicable. She had Samuel, yet she had slept with William.

Samuel was her only salvation. How could she betray him?

With trembling fingers, she swiped the screen and answered the call.

"Victoria, why did it take you so long to answer?" Samuel's warm, pleasant voice came through the phone, and Victoria could almost picture his smiling face.

A complex emotion flashed in Victoria's eyes. She bit her lip and whispered, "I was just drinking some water."

There was a brief pause before Samuel spoke again, "You sound strange. Is everything okay?"

Victoria gripped the phone tightly, guilt and shame flooding her heart. "I'm fine, I just choked a little."

"I see," Samuel said, not suspecting anything. "I'm at the hospital now. Get some rest, goodnight."

Samuel hung up, and two hot tears rolled down Victoria's cheeks.

In this relationship, Samuel had given so much more than she had.

How could she let a few sweet words from William lead her to betray Samuel?

"Do you regret it?" William's voice drifted over.

Victoria snapped back to reality, meeting his deep gaze.

Tears glistened in her eyes as she shook her head and choked out, "William, you need to leave. Don't come looking for me again."

"What do you mean?" William's anger flared, and he slammed his hand on the nightstand, shattering the intimate atmosphere. "We were just making love, and now you want to cut ties?"

"What else can I do?" Victoria mustered the courage to look up at him. "Will you break up with Alice?"

At the mention of Alice, William's expression turned cold.

He loved Victoria, but he couldn't leave Alice.

He owed her.

Victoria took a deep breath and spoke again, "I believe you have feelings for me, but William, you're going to marry her. Do you want me to be the mistress everyone despises?"

Victoria closed her eyes, waiting for his answer.

But William remained silent.

The room was deathly quiet, the spring rain tapping against the window.

After a long while, William's hoarse voice broke the silence, "Victoria, can't you just hang in there for me? I'll try to make it up to you."

Make it up to her? Victoria let out a bitter laugh. Compensation was not what she needed.

Her heart ached as she slowly opened her eyes, staring at the chandelier on the ceiling. Her voice was distant, "William, either you break up with Alice," she paused, "or you never show up in front of me again."

William's breath hitched, his grip on her shoulder tightening, veins bulging as if he might explode any second.

He gritted his teeth and said, "Fine, if that's what you want, I'll fulfill your wish!"

Victoria exhaled sharply at his words.

William climbed off her, picked up his clothes from the floor, dressed, and left.

Victoria watched his broad back disappear through the door, her eyes welling up with tears.

She picked up the documents William had left behind. It was the transfer agreement for Nora's house. If she signed it, the house would be hers.

She tossed the papers onto the table and covered her face, silently crying.

William stepped out of the building, a cold wind hitting him, making him shiver.

He stood by the roadside, lighting a cigarette and taking a slow drag, exhaling smoke.

He squinted, a dull ache in his chest. This feeling was unbearable.

The hospital's test results were in. In a twist of fate, Victoria was a perfect match for Nora.

Nora's condition was critical. Without a transplant soon, she would miss the best window for treatment.

Victoria faced a tough decision: save Nora or bear the burden of guilt.

As Victoria was about to enter the doctor's office, she ran into Nora.

Nora looked haggard, a far cry from her once proud self. Her hair was disheveled, her face pale, and wrinkles lined her features.

Supported by a nurse, she stood weakly, but upon seeing Victoria, a cold glint flashed in her eyes, and a mocking smile curled her lips, her gaze locking onto Victoria.

Victoria understood her thoughts. Nora was certain Victoria wouldn't refuse to donate her kidney.

But if Bobby had been the match, Nora would never have accepted his kidney.

The attending physician, Dr. Myers, approached Victoria with the consent form for the surgery.

Handing it to her, Dr. Myers spoke earnestly, "Victoria, you're still young. You need to think this through carefully. Maybe talk to your friends and get their opinions."

Nora scoffed, "Dr. Myers, what are you implying? Are you trying to stop my daughter from saving me? Aren't doctors supposed to save lives? Why are you holding me back?"

Dr. Myers frowned, patiently explaining, "This is a necessary process. We have to save lives, but we can't harm others in the process."

"It's just a kidney! I gave birth to her, she owes me! She should give me her life if I ask for it!" Nora's words grew harsher, and a nearby nurse couldn't help but mutter, "How can she say that? Is she really her mother?"

###chapter 138 Donating a Kidney

"I'll sign."

Victoria didn't hesitate for a second.

The more Nora pressured her, the more she wanted to end it all quickly and cut ties with her.

She picked up the pen and swiftly signed her name. Then she asked Dr. Myers in detail about the surgery schedule and precautions, planning to arrange her work around it.

Back home, she called Elara and told her everything that had happened.

Elara was furious, stomping her foot. "Are you out of your mind? You're messing with your health! Even if you have another kidney, this is gonna take a toll on your body. You're not even married yet. What if your future husband finds out you had this surgery? Even if he doesn't care, you wouldn't want to be a burden, would you?"

Elara tried to talk some sense into her. "Forget about your mom. After everything she's done to you, why do you still care? If you ruin your health, what about your dad's injustice? He'd want you to live well. If something happens to you because of this surgery, how could you face him?"

Victoria lowered her eyes, holding back tears.

She thought she was mentally prepared, but when Elara mentioned Alvin, her heart ached sharply.

She had indeed overlooked Alvin's feelings and could imagine how heartbroken he would be if he knew.

After a long pause, she said softly, "Elara, please don't tell Samuel or anyone else about this."

Seeing that she couldn't persuade her, Elara sighed helplessly and turned away.

Elara was both angry and heartbroken. She wanted to scold her, but seeing Victoria's forced strength and lonely helplessness, she just couldn't bring herself to.

With a mother like that, what could she do?

Could she really just watch Nora die?

If Victoria refused, Nora would definitely spread it around, using blood tie and morality to guilt-trip her, making her live in guilt and blame for the rest of her life.

"What a misfortune!" Elara's eyes reddened. She stopped trying to persuade her and just asked, "What about Samuel? Would he agree if he knew?"

"He doesn't agree, but he said he'd respect my decision. He had a car accident recently, and I didn't tell him about the surgery."

Elara hesitated but finally said, "Victoria, if you go through with this surgery, Samuel's parents might not accept you."

Victoria's expression was calm as she nodded. "I know. If they really oppose it, there's nothing I can do."

This surgery made her see reality clearly.

The ordinary happiness she longed for might never be achievable.

Elara felt sorry for her. "Samuel truly likes you. He's done a lot for you. It would be a shame to give up now."

"Elara," Victoria forced a smile, "I don't want this either."

Elara's heart ached. Seeing the tears in Victoria's eyes, she hugged her tightly and sighed softly.

Three days before the surgery, Victoria went to the hospital alone.

She had to be admitted with Nora for pre-surgery checks. She felt she could handle these procedures herself and didn't ask Elara to accompany her.

Nora had been released on bail. Occasionally, they ran into each other during the checks, but they acted like strangers, with no interaction.

Only when Victoria wasn't looking, Nora would glare at her with cold, venomous eyes.

Victoria treated her like a stranger, focused solely on repaying the debt of birth and then cutting ties forever.

The smell of disinfectant stung her nose as Victoria slowly made her way back to her room after a blood draw, leaning against the wall.

The needle marks on her pale skin were bruised. She pulled her sleeve down but froze when she opened the door.

A tall figure stood by the window, back facing her.

The man wore a sharp suit, broad shoulders, and a narrow waist, exuding a cold, unapproachable aura.

His hands were in his pockets, and despite the comfortable room temperature, he seemed to bring a chill with him, making the air around him colder.

His coat was casually draped over the sofa, and a black suitcase sat on the floor, making him look travel-worn.

Hearing the noise, he turned abruptly, the cold glint from his wristwatch flashing across her terrified face.

Victoria was slightly taken aback. She hadn't expected to see him again so soon, at least not so suddenly.

She walked in slowly, discarding the cotton ball pressed against her arm and pulling down her sleeve to hide the needle marks and bruises.

Seeing him turn but not speak, Victoria broke the silence first. "What are you doing here?"

"You're donating a kidney to Nora?" William leaned against the window, crushing a cigarette between his fingers, the embers falling onto his handmade shoes.

His eyes, filled with suppressed anger, bore into her. "Victoria, do you have a brain in that head of yours?"

Victoria pressed her lips together, not answering.

She felt it was her decision and didn't need to explain it to anyone.

William was infuriated by her silence, a cold, humorless smile flashing across his stern face, carrying a sharp edge.

"I think you're being incredibly stupid!"

He took a deep breath, but the coldness around him remained, as he stepped closer, his smile dangerous. "What is Nora to you? How dare she ask for your kidney?"

Victoria lifted her chin slightly, watching him approach.

This was a side of William she had never seen. Even when angry, he had always been controlled and restrained.

But now, he seemed to have lost all reason, driven by a need to vent his fury.

"Do you think you're some kind of savior? Or just a pawn to be trampled on?" William sneered. "What makes Nora worthy of your sacrifice? Does she deserve it?"

He stopped in front of her, looking down, his eyes dark and menacing.

Victoria clenched her fists, her chest heaving.

His words hit her deepest wounds, and she struggled to hold back her tears.

William let out a cold laugh, mocking her. "You always have a sharp tongue with me, never taking any crap. But with Nora and Bobby, you just take it, letting them walk all over you?"

He reached out, roughly grabbing her chin, forcing her to look at him. "If you want to be this foolish, you need my permission first!"

Victoria desperately tried to avoid his touch, struggling to break free. "Let go! I don't need your permission!"

William stared at her coldly, his deep eyes flashing with a terrifying intensity. "I forbid it! If you donate that kidney, I'll make sure she dies first!"

Victoria trembled, biting her lip, her stubbornness evoking pity.

William's heart softened, and he wanted to pull her into his arms, to kiss away all her pain and sorrow until she gave in.

But he couldn't.

Victoria shouldn't have to endure this suffering.

"William, I understand your concern," Victoria choked out, "but she's my mom. No matter how bad she is, I can't just watch her die. If I did, I'd be in agony for the rest of my life. Can you understand that?"

Seeing her still so determined, William felt a surge of frustration.

He grabbed her frail arm and pushed her away, his tone harsh. "Victoria! If so, I'll make her disappear right now! Let's see how she can hurt you then!"

William, in his rage, seemed like a wild beast out of control. Victoria, frightened by his intensity, instinctively hugged him from behind, her voice trembling. "Don't go!"

"Let go!"

###chapter 139 I Am Scared

William was fuming as he sped back into town, having dropped everything the moment he got the news. He'd completely forgotten Victoria's words about not wanting to see him again.

The whole way back, his anger at Victoria's naivety was only outdone by his hatred for Nora's selfishness. His loathing for Nora was even stronger than his desire to see Alvin punished by the law.

For Alvin, he just wanted legal justice, but for Nora, he was filled with murderous intent. He knew countless ways to make someone vanish without a trace, ensuring Nora would live the rest of her life in endless regret and pain.

He wouldn't let Nora hurt Victoria anymore.

Sensing his determination, Victoria clung to him tighter, her voice trembling with tears, "Please, don't go!"

William narrowed his bloodshot eyes and sneered, "You're so spineless, not fighting back. Are you just gonna let her keep hurting you?"

He impatiently tried to pry her hands off, but as he glanced down, he saw the needle marks on her arm. The sight of the wounds on her smooth skin ignited his fury even more.

"You're such an idiot, putting yourself through this for someone like her!" He forcefully shook off her hands and stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

"William!"

Victoria panicked and tried to follow, but she stumbled and fell, hitting her elbow on the corner of the table. The pain made her grimace, and sweat beaded on her forehead.

She pulled herself up using the bed for support and chased after him in her slippers.

Nora's room wasn't far.

As soon as she reached the hallway, she heard Nora's terrified screams.

She saw William dragging Nora by the neck like a ragdoll into the elevator.

Watching the elevator ascend to the top floor, Victoria's fear peaked.

Ignoring the pain in her knees, she ran up the stairs like a madwoman.

When she burst through the rooftop door, she saw William standing on the edge, pushing Nora over the railing.

Nora's face was ashen with fear, her hands gripping the metal frame desperately, her head hanging over the edge, ready to fall at any moment.

"Help!" Nora screamed, her voice hoarse with terror. "Please, let me go!"

Victoria, frantic, rushed to the edge and wrapped her arms around Nora's waist, locking her in place.

"What are you doing? William, stop this!"

William glanced at her coldly, his grip on Nora unrelenting. Nora dangled precariously, ready to drop at any second.

"This has nothing to do with you! Get back!" William's face was twisted with rage. 

He no longer cared about the law or principles. To him, Nora was no better than a cockroach. How could someone so selfish and vile be worth Victoria sacrificing her health?

If it meant keeping Victoria safe, he would make Nora disappear.

He couldn't allow anything that threatened Victoria's life, including Nora.

Victoria gritted her teeth, stubbornly holding onto Nora. "William, pull her up! Are you out of your mind?"

William's eyes were bloodshot, and he barked, "Let go!"

"No!" Victoria's eyes reddened with desperation, her voice breaking. "William, I'm begging you. I'm scared, really scared."

She cried and pleaded, clinging to him like a drowning person grasping at a lifeline.

William stared at her face for a long time before finally loosening his grip.

Victoria, overjoyed, quickly pulled Nora back to safety.

Nora collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath, her voice trembling with fear. "William! I swear, I won't let this go. I'm calling the police. You'll go to jail!"

William looked down at her coldly, squatting beside her, and said slowly, "You can try. Let's see if I go to jail or if your precious son dies first."

Nora's body shook, her eyes wide with shock and fear. She knew William wasn't just making empty threats.

If she dared to call the police, William would definitely take her and Bobby out.

He was a man who meant what he said.

Nora's face twisted with hatred as she glared at William. "Fine, I give up!"

With that, she shakily crawled away from the rooftop.

Victoria sat on the ground, still trembling with fear.

William knelt beside her, pulling her into a tight embrace, as if trying to merge her with his body. "I'm sorry I scared you."

His warm breath brushed her ear, and Victoria's tense body gradually relaxed. She looked up, tears streaming down her face. "William, I'm not worth you risking yourself."

"You are worth it," he said, his voice hoarse, hiding a deep emotion.

Victoria stared at him, then suddenly hugged his neck tightly. "You scared me so much! I was so afraid you'd become a murderer because of me. I was so afraid you'd end up in jail like my dad."

"Who asked you to do this for me?" Victoria sobbed against his chest. "I don't want anything to happen to you. Do you understand?"

William's pupils contracted, swallowing her salty tears.

The wind blew across the rooftop, and Victoria felt as fragile as glass in his arms.

William's gaze changed, a fiery emotion welling up inside him, suppressed for too long, now bursting forth.

He held her close, his chin resting on her soft hair, gently caressing her pale cheek. "Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to me."

Victoria looked at him, stunned.

William cupped her face and kissed her deeply.

She closed her eyes, wrapping her arms around his waist, responding to his kiss.

They kissed passionately, neither willing to let go, until the door opened.

Harry saw the scene on the rooftop, paused, and quickly retreated.

William noticed Victoria's bare feet and sighed, picking her up and carrying her back to the room.

As he walked, he gently reminded her, "Listen to me, give up the idea of donating your kidney to her, okay?"

###chapter 140 You're in Love with Him

Victoria looked up at him, her eyes filled with hesitation. Finally, she softly pleaded, "William, can you just leave me alone?"

William's head snapped down to look at her, his eyes wide with disbelief.

Victoria jumped off him, her face earnest as she continued, "Aren't you getting married soon? Stop worrying about me and focus on your big day. My life is my own to handle. You can't protect me forever."

William's brows furrowed as he watched her walk past him with her head down.

He quickly stepped forward, blocking her path, his voice tinged with obvious anger, "What if I insist on being involved?"

"It's my body, my choice. No one gets to decide for me unless you lock me up like those people."

Victoria gently lowered his hand, pushed open the hospital room door, and walked in without looking back.

William stared at the closed door, knowing full well how stubborn Victoria was. Once she made up her mind, no one could change it.

For the first time in his life, William felt powerless. This feeling left him frustrated and without an outlet for his emotions.

Nora was nearly scared to death by William.

She could feel that he genuinely wanted to strangle her at that moment.

When had Nora ever suffered such a fate?

But that damn William threatened her with Bobby!

She couldn't just let it go. She was unwilling to accept it!

She thought to herself, even if she couldn't say anything directly, what if someone else spread the word? Then it wouldn't be her fault, right?

When the nurse came to draw her blood for tests, she deliberately cried out in distress, "I'm as old as his parents, and he bullies me like this. Just because they have money, they think they can do anything! My life is so miserable!"

The doctors and nurses didn't want to get involved, treating her words like a joke, offering a few perfunctory responses before preparing to leave.

It was a joke, really. Not to mention that William was a major shareholder in this hospital, everyone knew how Nora treated her biological daughter, Victoria. They had all seen it.

She constantly exploited and demanded from Victoria, and now that Victoria was going to give her a kidney, she didn't feel any remorse. Instead, she kept badmouthing Victoria.

If it were any other mother, even a foster mother, she wouldn't accept her child's donation, right?

So, even though Nora cried her eyes out, the medical staff ignored her, pretending not to hear, completely disregarding her.

"You don't understand, he even threatened me! I used to be a respected lady, and he..."

The door suddenly opened.

Victoria walked in with a dark expression.

Seeing this, the others quickly finished their tasks and left the room.

With no one else around, Nora immediately dropped her pitiful act, replacing it with a look of disdain.

Victoria closed the door, turned around, and stared at her sharply, "Shut your mouth! This has nothing to do with William. Don't let me hear you mention him again!"

Nora squinted her eyes, a mocking smile on her lips, "You're in love with him."

Victoria's eyelashes trembled slightly as she lowered her gaze, speaking softly, "That's my business."

"What a joke. He's got a fiancée and is getting married. Are you planning to keep being his side chick after he ties the knot? How could I have such a shameless daughter? You bring shame to me!"

Nora's insults grew harsher, her eyes filled with resentment.

Victoria's face showed a hint of sarcasm as she quietly stared at her, "You're right. You cheated during marriage and I become a mistress. We truly are mother and daughter."

Nora was momentarily speechless.

"You!" Nora gritted her teeth, glaring at her, wishing she could tear her apart.

Victoria gave her a cold look, "And don't forget your current situation!"

Nora's face changed abruptly, glaring at her viciously, "What, you don't want to donate your kidney anymore? I'll tell your father about you being a mistress. Let's see how you face him then!"

She pointed at Victoria, her emotions out of control, "William is backing you up, huh? Unless he can protect you for life, you'll never escape my grasp! If you don't donate your kidney today, I'll make your life miserable tomorrow! You hurt my son, I'll destroy you!"

She laughed maniacally, but Victoria's heart was already calm. She turned and walked out.

That night, Dr. Myers brought a stack of documents for her to sign, mostly disclaimers about the risks of the surgery, meaning that if anything went wrong, she would bear all the consequences.

Victoria wasn't a medical professional, but she understood the gist of these terms.

After she signed everything, Dr. Myers sighed and said, "As a doctor, I have to fulfill my duties, but I sincerely advise you to reconsider. If something goes wrong, who will take care of you? Who can you rely on?" 

Victoria tightly gripped the papers in her hand, momentarily speechless, unsure of how to respond.

She returned to her room, the surgery scheduled for the next morning. Victoria tried to study for her University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam, but she couldn't focus.

At a nightclub, William sat in a corner booth, the table in front of him littered with empty glasses. He had lost count of how much he had drunk.

Despite the alcohol coursing through his veins, his eyes remained cold, with a hint of fierceness.

A girl dressed provocatively approached him. "Hey there, you look like you're having a rough night."

William glanced at her. She wore a tight, short dress that accentuated her curves, her ample chest and slim waist drawing attention.

Victoria had a similarly graceful figure, but she always wore loose clothing, hiding her body. Only up close could one appreciate the allure beneath her clothes.

Men naturally have a desire to explore, and William often imagined gently unbuttoning her shirt.

As the thought crossed his mind, his eyes turned icy.

What was he thinking?

William tilted his head back, downing his drink in one gulp. His collar was slightly open, his Adam's apple moving, giving him a rebellious look.

This slightly tipsy appearance, with a touch of wildness, was incredibly attractive to the girl.

Seeing that he didn't respond, she took it as a sign of consent and eagerly sat next to him, her hand reaching for his shoulder.

###chapter 141 Do You Love Her?

"Get lost." William's voice dripped with irritation.

The girl turned beet red, spat out, "Jerk, no wonder you got dumped," and stormed off in her high heels.

Dumped.

That word hit William like a punch to the gut, his face darkening instantly.

His buddy, Eugene Bailey, who had tagged along, glanced at him, silently ordered a drink, and slid it over. "Man, it's rare to see you like this."

William didn't respond, just grabbed the drink and downed it in one go.

Eugene chuckled, "That's not how you drink, dude. If you really wanna get wasted, go for vodka. One shot and you're out."

William slowly lifted his gaze, giving him a cold stare, "I came here for some peace and quiet. Why are you yapping so much?"

Eugene, intrigued, leaned in closer, "Did you really get dumped? By who? Alice?"

He shook his head, "Nah, you two seemed solid. Even when you fought before, you never looked this down."

William gave a bitter smile, pushing the glass back towards Eugene.

Eugene raised an eyebrow, "Now I'm really curious about the woman who could do this to you. Who is she, making you drown your sorrows in booze?"

William shot him a look, "Drop it, can we talk about something else?"

Eugene paused, then burst into laughter, "I never thought I'd see the day!"

As his laughter died down, he looked past William and raised a hand in greeting, "Alice!"

William glanced over, his tone indifferent, "What are you doing here?"

Alice, dressed in a pink dress with a light pink cardigan, looked sweet and delicate, the kind of girl who easily evoked a protective instinct in men.

She didn't respond, just quietly sat down next to William, gently wrapping her arm around his and resting her head on his shoulder.

Eugene couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, glancing at William with a knowing smile.

Alice had wrapped her arm around the very spot the other girl had almost touched earlier.

Everyone in their circle knew about Alice's possessiveness over William.

On the surface, she was gentle and harmless, but in reality, her possessiveness was intense. If William so much as spoke to another woman, she'd go crazy, sometimes even doing something drastic.

Just a few days ago, when she heard that Lyanna had gone to Harborview City with William, she had someone beat Lyanna up and accused her of being a mistress.

If William hadn't stepped in to smooth things over, Lyanna's family wouldn't have let it go.

But when it didn't involve William, Alice would instantly revert to being the sweet, gentle girl.

This stark contrast made everyone marvel at William's charm, that he could make a woman act like this.

So, Eugene immediately saw through it. She must have been here the whole time, watching the other girl's every move.

Eugene smartly moved to the other side, not wanting to interrupt the couple.

William didn't move, letting Alice hold his arm, as he picked up his drink and downed most of it.

"William!" Alice's voice was soft and sweet, "Have you decided where to go for our honeymoon?"

William squinted slightly, slowly turning to look at her.

She said, "I want to go to the beach and see the fireflies."

William finished the rest of his drink in one gulp.

Eugene, sipping his drink, listened intently to the gossip.

Putting down his glass, William turned, his expression calm, "I can't make love with you."

Eugene nearly spat out his drink, thinking to himself, 'That's blunt. Do I just hear something I shouldn't have?'

Alice, still leaning on William's arm, stiffened, staying in that position for a long time without moving.

William's tone was flat and emotionless, "We've tried, and you know it didn't work."

Alice's face turned pale.

She was already delicate, and now she looked even more pitiful, turning to William with a hurt expression that could break anyone's heart.

But in William's mind, it was Victoria's face that appeared.

Victoria, who was always stubborn and strong in the face of adversity, but would cry her heart out because of him when he acted impulsively.

At that moment, William felt that he wouldn't have refused if she had asked for his life.

Alice, her voice trembling, called out softly, "William!"

William looked up at the sound, his gaze falling on her face.

Alice's eyes were filled with tears, her voice shaking as she reached out and tightly held William's hand, "I know about you and Victoria. I don't want to hold it against you anymore, and I won't be jealous. Let's just pretend nothing happened and be good to each other, okay?"

Eugene, watching from the side, couldn't help but frown.

They had known each other for years, growing up together. Their bond was deep.

Seeing Alice so humble and pleading, Eugene felt uncomfortable.

So, he stepped forward, casually leaning on the back of the sofa, looking at William, "William, what's wrong with you today? Can't you talk nicely? Look at how scared Alice is!"

William leaned back slightly, lounging on the sofa with an air of lazy elegance, but his eyes were as cold as a winter night, devoid of any warmth.

"Because Alice isn't an outsider, I don't want to beat around the bush. It's better for everyone if I'm straightforward." William looked up at her.

Her eyes were red, biting her lip, and after a long pause, she asked, "Do you love her?"

William stared at her for a moment, then suddenly laughed, "Alice, if I said I love her, would you believe me?"

Alice's whole body shook, her face draining of color.

"I don't believe you." Her voice was filled with deep sorrow, "You're lying to me!"

William dropped his playful attitude, looking at her seriously, "I'm not lying. I said I love her."

Alice suddenly started laughing softly, her eyes welling up with tears as she wiped them away with a tissue, her voice choked with emotion, "William, what do all these years of waiting mean then? What about the suffering and depression I endured for you?"

William lowered his gaze, staying silent.

Eugene, seeing her like this, felt a bit scared, quickly stepping forward to comfort her, "Alice, don't get upset. Let's talk this through. William must be joking. Don't take it to heart."

Alice seemed not to hear, her eyes fixed on William, red and seemingly about to bleed, "I don't care if you're telling the truth or not. I want you to promise me you'll never see her again!"

###chapter 142 Of Course It's Your Fault

William furrowed his brows slightly, glancing sideways at her with a detached tone, "Are you giving me orders?"

Alice looked at him, tears welling up in her eyes, then suddenly gave a sorrowful smile, "Why not? William, don't forget, if it weren't for me, you'd be dead by now!"

Eugene's brow furrowed deeply.

That incident was an unspoken taboo between them.

Although their friends knew the details, no one ever mentioned it in front of them. Alice and William acted as if it had never happened.

This was the first time Alice had brought it up.

As expected, William pressed his lips tightly together and slowly lowered his gaze.

Alice laughed, but her laughter was trembling, "To save you, I was tortured by those bastards for hours!"

Eugene quickly intervened, "Alice, stop it, that's enough."

William's eyes began to change, his fists slowly clenching.

Alice, seemingly unaware, continued, "Do you know how many times I was violated during those hours?"

"Stop it!"

William abruptly cut her off, his knuckles turning white as his fists clenched, veins bulging on the back of his hands.

"Why can't I say it?"

Alice, having revealed her deepest secret, seemed to relax, a hint of calmness in her expression.

"I know you despise me, that's why you won't get close to me. But William, who made me like this? Where's your basic human decency?"

William gritted his teeth, his voice squeezed out from between them, "I never despised you! To me, chastity means nothing!"

Alice's laugh was filled with sarcasm, "Then tell me, why haven't you touched me all these years?"

By the end, her voice was hoarse, almost screaming.

Her eyes were bloodshot, like a doll that had been cruelly mistreated, pitiful and heart-wrenching.

William looked at her, his throat tightening, but he couldn't find the words to defend himself.

Eugene, seeing this, became anxious, "William, say something!"

Fortunately, the bar's music was deafening, and no one noticed the commotion, thinking it was just a couple having a spat.

Eugene felt stifled listening to it all.

"I tried, more than once." William had regained his composure, his tone almost indifferent, "But I just don't feel any sexual desire when I'm with you."

Eugene couldn't bear to listen any longer.

This situation was beyond help.

Alice stared at William, devastated. When a man tells you he has no sexual interest in you, it's a hundred times more hurtful than saying "I don't love you anymore."

Alice felt as if her heart was being torn apart, the pain unbearable.

The suffocating feeling made her almost faint, unable to breathe.

Her eyes filled with tears, she used all her strength to keep them from falling.

Overwhelmed with resentment and grievance, she just wanted to vent all her emotions.

She walked into the nightclub's dance floor.

Unlike Victoria's casual sexiness, Alice's allure, beneath her fragile exterior, was enough to captivate men, stirring their protective and conquering instincts.

She shrugged off her cardigan, flaunting her delicate beauty, quickly attracting a group of men. Gradually, their bodies pressed closer, their hands wandering.

William kept his back to her.

Eugene frowned, walked over, and nodded towards her, lowering his voice, "Are you really going to do nothing?"

William's brows furrowed, his tone indifferent, "She's an adult, she should be responsible for herself."

Eugene understood, but William's earlier words were too hurtful, especially considering Alice's traumatic past. Leaving her like this could lead to trouble.

"You should take her home."

William remained silent for a moment, then downed his last drink, set the glass down, and stood up.

He walked straight into the dance floor, coldly pushing away the man who was half-holding Alice, and without a word, dragged her out.

Alice didn't speak, just looked at William with a mix of longing and sorrow.

But the others weren't happy!

"Hey! Who said you could leave?"

William immediately turned and punched him in the face!

The man staggered back, clutching his mouth, cursing, "Bastard! How dare you hit me! I'll destroy you!"

He swung at William.

William kicked him in the stomach, sending him and his friend crashing to the ground, crying out in pain.

The crowd scattered in panic.

"Are you looking for trouble?" The other men grabbed weapons.

The scene was chaotic.

Luckily, the bar belonged to Eugene, who quickly called security to control the situation.

Outside the bar, Daisy stood with her arms crossed, her gaze icy.

"Causing trouble in a bar, really? William, do you still think you're a kid?"

William sat on the steps, a cigarette between his fingers, looking as gloomy as a storm cloud.

Alice tried to explain, "It's not his fault, it's mine."

"Of course it's your fault!" Daisy turned, her sharp gaze piercing Alice, "Alice, sometimes I wonder, do you love him, or are you trying to get back at him for what happened?"

"It's not like that, I don't," Alice defended herself.

"How many fights has William gotten into because of you? Can you honestly say you had no part in it? There are plenty of women in the world, why did those thugs target you, the Garcia family's princess?"

"I didn't, Aunt Daisy, let me explain." Alice lowered her head, tears welling up again.

"Don't call me Aunt! I don't have a niece like you!" Daisy's face was full of disdain, "Don't play the victim with me. I've seen enough over the years! You might fool William, but not me. Get out of here, and if William gets hurt because of you again, I won't let you off!"

"Aunt Daisy!"

"Get out!"

###chapter 143 Preoperative Preparations

Daisy cut her off without hesitation.

Alice was stunned for a moment, and when she looked up, her face was already streaked with tears.

She knew Daisy disliked her and was always harsh, but today she was especially severe and resolute.

But Daisy was William's aunt, and as a junior, Alice felt it was inappropriate to defy her.

"Enough."

William stubbed out his cigarette and looked up at Daisy. "I'm tired. Can I go home now?"

Daisy glanced at Alice, then turned and opened the car door.

William stood up and gave Alice a look. "Harry will take you home."

"Okay!" Alice, as obedient as a kitten, acted as if nothing had happened.

She stepped forward and took his hand, noticing the scrapes on his knuckles. She leaned in and gently kissed them. "We still have to prepare for the wedding in a few days. Go home and get some rest."

William looked at her and nodded. "Okay."

In the car, Daisy turned her face away, thinking 'out of sight, out of mind.'

Once William got in, Daisy floored the gas pedal, and the car sped off.

Daisy's voice was cold and hard as she drove. "Are you really going to marry her?"

"Yes."

"What about Victoria?"

William turned his head to look out the window. "What does she have to do with this?"

"How long are you going to keep pretending?" Daisy was tired of his games and got straight to the point. "Don't tell me you don't like her. If you didn't, why would you drag me all the way here? Why would you make me save the person you hate the most?"

William frowned, clearly annoyed. "Why are you saying so much? Did you get it done or not?"

Daisy didn't respond immediately. She turned the steering wheel and parked the car under a streetlight. Then she turned and smacked him on the head. "What kind of attitude is that? Who do you think I am? You're getting pretty bold. Are you looking for trouble?"

William was both angry and helpless. Daisy hit hard, and his head throbbed with pain, but he couldn't fight back. He could only grab her wrist and say, "Alright, alright, I was wrong. It's my fault."

Daisy finally let him go, leaned back in her seat, and lit a cigarette. The smoke blurred her features as she narrowed her beautiful eyes and said slowly, "It's all taken care of."

Hearing this, William sighed in relief. "Thank you, Aunt Daisy."

Daisy gave him a sidelong glance, half-smiling. "Don't thank me just yet. I'm warning you, figure out what you really want. Don't wait until it's too late to regret it."

"I know what I'm doing," William said.

Daisy snorted. "If you really knew, you wouldn't have done something so stupid tonight!"

William pressed his lips together and said nothing.

"Forget it. Talking to you is pointless. You never listen anyway." Daisy put out her cigarette and started the car again.

Elara arrived at the hospital at the crack of dawn.

She carried a bulging bag filled with various essentials for Victoria.

Seeing Elara's worried expression, Victoria tried to cheer her up with a smile. "Elara, look on the bright side. Now I can finally take a break! No need to rush to work, no deadlines for my design drafts, and no dealing with difficult clients. Plus, I can study for the University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam!"

With a loud thud, Elara slammed her thermos on the table and turned to glare at Victoria. "There's nothing good about it! You shouldn't do this surgery, giving your kidney to that heartless mother!"

The more Elara thought about it, the more upset she became. She tried to reason with Victoria. "Victoria, you're only twenty. Your life is just beginning. Without a healthy body, how will you work and strive for your future? And what if you meet someone you truly love? You can't expect them to deal with your health issues. They deserve a healthy partner. What if something happens to you? What will your loved one do then?"

Victoria listened quietly. She understood Elara's points, but she couldn't give up on what she believed to be right because of uncertain future concerns.

She knew it might not be the wisest choice, but to her, it was the only choice.

"Elara, I can't think that far ahead. I just believe that there are many ways to live, and there's no absolute right way. The best way is the one that feels right to you."

Hearing this, Elara realized that no matter how much she tried to persuade her, Victoria wouldn't change her mind.

She could only sigh and wipe away her tears.

Soon, Dr. Myers came in for the final pre-surgery check.

"Are you ready? It's almost time to go to the operating room."

"Yes." Victoria's expression was calm.

"Don't worry. The risk for you is relatively low. Just trust us." Dr. Myers gave a few more routine instructions before leaving.

At that moment, there was a soft knock on the door.

Victoria was half-leaning on the bed, clutching her phone, deep in thought.

She knew she would soon be wheeled into the operating room. Despite the doctors' reassurances, she was well aware that surgery always carried risks, and she felt a bit anxious.

Right now, she just wanted to talk to someone, to say some final words.

But she didn't know who to contact or where to start.

Her fingers hovered over a name in her contacts, unable to move.

Suddenly, she snapped out of it, as if burned, and quickly tossed her phone aside.

Just then, the door to the room opened, and a figure appeared in the doorway.

"Sir, who are you looking for?" Elara asked, stepping forward. Victoria instinctively looked up.

But before she could speak, she froze.

She stared in shock at the man who walked in, her mouth slightly open, eyes wide as if she had seen something unbelievable.

Elara was about to stop the man, but seeing Victoria's reaction, she realized they must know each other. She asked softly, "Victoria, who is he?"

Victoria's eyes filled with tears instantly.

Ignoring everything, she threw off the covers, stepped barefoot onto the floor, and stumbled forward with open arms, her voice trembling as she cried out, "Dad!"

###chapter 144 Father

Alvin stood still, letting Victoria collapse into his arms.

Victoria was trembling with sobs, clutching Alvin's waist and burying her head in his chest. "Dad, is it really you? Am I dreaming?" she choked out.

She was terrified that everything in front of her was just an illusion.

Her emotions were a whirlwind, and tears streamed down her face like a broken string of pearls.

Alvin gently patted Victoria's back, soothing her in a low voice, "Silly girl. I'm here. This isn't a dream. I'm back. Don't cry."

"Dad! Dad!" Victoria cried even harder, gripping Alvin's shirt tightly, filled with deep-seated grievance and dependence. "Dad, I missed you so much. I've been waiting for you to come back every single day, for so long."

Victoria was a mess of tears, and Alvin's heart ached for her. He could only keep comforting her, "I'm so sorry, Victoria. It's all my fault. You've been through so much."

Elara stood nearby, her mouth agape in shock. She never expected that the man in front of her was actually Victoria's father-the one who was supposed to be in prison.

Outside the hospital room, Daisy paused, glancing back down the empty hallway.

Around the corner, William leaned against the wall, a lit cigarette between his fingers.

He looked down, watching the smoke curl around his fingers, his handsome, aloof face partially hidden in the haze.

He had never heard Victoria cry so heartbreakingly before. Her sobs were filled with endless grievance, like a lost child, stubborn yet full of despair.

It was as if she had been struggling alone for so long, and only now, seeing her family, could she finally let down her guard and cry her heart out.

William's heart twisted painfully.

Inside the room, Victoria's emotions were completely out of control.

All the grievances and sadness she had suppressed for so long burst forth like a flood.

She clung to Alvin's shoulder, sobbing uncontrollably.

Alvin held Victoria's thin, frail body, his heart aching. "Victoria, it's all my fault. I've made you suffer so much. I'm sorry."

"No, Dad, don't say that. It's not your fault. You had no choice," Victoria shook her head, her voice hoarse.

"Victoria!" Alvin reached out a trembling hand, gently stroking her soft, short hair.

"Dad, tell me, you won't leave me again, right?"

Victoria suddenly looked up, her tear-filled eyes gazing at Alvin.

"Don't worry. He's been released on parole. As long as he behaves, he won't have to go back," Daisy said calmly as she entered the room.

Alvin turned his head, looking at Daisy with gratitude in his eyes.

Daisy, however, didn't spare him a glance, walking straight to Victoria.

Victoria quickly wiped the tears from her cheeks and stood up. "Thank you, Ms. Scott. Thank you for saving my dad."

Daisy smiled and shook her head. "Don't thank me. You should know who helped you and why he got your dad out."

Victoria fell silent, her heart pounding.

She knew exactly who had helped her get Alvin out.

She never expected he would go this far for her.

Alvin's face darkened at Daisy's words.

He grabbed Victoria's wrist. "Let's go home."

That simple phrase, "Let's go home," was like a key, unlocking the softest part of Victoria's heart.

Victoria couldn't hold back any longer. Tears streamed down her face as she clutched Alvin's hand, nodding vigorously. "Yeah, let's go home."

That word "home" carried all her hopes and dreams for so many days and nights.

Of all the words in the world, only "home" could touch the deepest part of her soul and warm her heart.

Alvin smiled with relief, pulling Victoria towards the door.

Before Victoria could respond, they heard hurried footsteps outside, and then Nora burst in.

"Why are you crying so miserably before surgery? Are you that eager for me to die?" She pushed the door open and froze when she saw the people inside.

Hearing her voice, Alvin's brow furrowed, his expression growing darker.

He pulled Victoria towards the door.

Nora was too shocked to speak, shaking her head in disbelief. "Alvin, how did you get out? What's going on?"

The Alvin in front of her, after two years in prison, looked much more rugged but still had those sharp features. The resilience in his eyes was even stronger, and he looked spirited, not at all like a worn-out prisoner.

In fact, he looked even more rugged and strong, making it hard to look away.

Maybe it was because they had been apart for two years, but at that moment, Nora felt a strange flutter for the man she once despised.

Nora smoothed her disheveled hair and straightened her hospital gown, trying to present herself better. "Alvin, now that you're here, don't you have anything to say to me?"

Alvin's eyes flashed, and he tightened his grip on Victoria's hand. "I have nothing to say to you."

With that, he pulled Victoria and walked quickly towards the door.

Nora panicked and rushed to block their way. "Wait! Victoria can't leave!"

Alvin stopped and turned to her. "What, do I need your permission to take my daughter home? Move!"

"No!" Nora, standing in front of him, still had a hint of coquettishness, as if she still lived in the past, thinking Alvin was the man who would do anything for her.

She pointed at Victoria, her arrogance returning. "Victoria, what's wrong with you? Are you going to let me die here?"

Alvin's long-suppressed anger exploded. He let go of Victoria's hand and grabbed Nora by the throat.

Nora was completely caught off guard, both shocked and furious, glaring at him. "Are you crazy?"

Just days ago, she had clashed with William, and the bruises on her neck hadn't even faded. Now, Alvin's grip made her cry out in pain.

Elara and Daisy rushed over to pull Alvin away.

Alvin's eyes were bloodshot, his voice low and hoarse. "The biggest regret of my life is not divorcing you when I found out you were cheating, letting Victoria suffer under your hands for so many years. When I was home, you at least held back a little. But once I was in prison, what did you do to her!"

Thinking about what Daisy had told him, about the things Bobby and Nora had done to Victoria over the past two years, Alvin wanted to tear them apart.

His precious Victoria, so well-behaved and sensible, had been bullied by Bobby and Nora.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. His eyes were bloodshot, and he tightened his grip on Nora's neck. "And you want her to donate a kidney to you? No way! I won't let you harm my daughter anymore!"

###chapter 145 No Donation

Nora struggled to pry Alvin's large hands off her neck, desperately slapping his chest, her face turning purple. "Let go, let go!"

Victoria, terrified by Alvin's demeanor, rushed over and hugged his waist, shouting, "Dad! Let go! Please, let go!"

Daisy, standing nearby, tried to reason with him. "Alvin, calm down. I worked so hard to get you out. Do you want to be locked up again and leave Victoria without her father's protection?"

Hearing this, Alvin's arms stiffened.

He slowly released his grip.

Nora collapsed to the floor, clutching her throat and gasping for air, trembling all over.

She could feel that Alvin had genuinely wanted to kill her just now.

She used to think Alvin was weak and easy to manipulate, but now she realized he could be more ruthless than anyone.

Alvin was completely different now.

Nora looked at Alvin's more rugged and masculine face, her heart pounding.

Despite her fear, an inexplicable thrill crept into her heart.

The commotion was so loud that doctors and nurses rushed over.

"What happened?"

Dr. Myers asked as he approached, but Alvin stepped forward, his tone somewhat restrained. "I'm Victoria's father."

Dr. Myers was slightly taken aback, having heard a bit about Alvin's situation.

He hadn't expected Alvin to be released.

"My daughter won't be having this surgery."

Dr. Myers looked troubled and turned to Victoria, speaking gently. "Ms. Carter is an adult. The final decision about the surgery is hers."

Nora panicked upon hearing this. If Victoria didn't donate her kidney, she would be left to die.

That couldn't happen.

But having just been threatened by Alvin, she didn't dare act out again. Instead, she pitifully pleaded with Victoria, "Victoria, you're the kindest child. If you don't help me, I'll die."

She cried as she spoke, looking pitiful.

Elara, seeing this, grew increasingly agitated. As an outsider, she shouldn't have said anything. But she had seen how much Victoria had suffered over the past two years.

She knew how harsh Nora had been to Victoria, so she couldn't help but speak up for her. "Nora, we're both mothers. Can you honestly say you deserve to be called a mother?"

Nora glared at her angrily. "Who do you think you are to lecture me?"

Elara scoffed, not backing down. "Do you think I want to waste my breath on someone like you? I may not be related to Victoria by blood, but I've seen how hard she's worked. She scrimps and saves, working long hours to support herself and you and your son, while you live comfortably. And what do you do? You only care about your son and treat Victoria like a cash cow. Do you think no one knows what you've done?"

Elara paused, then continued, "The things you and your son have done are shameful. How could a mother and brother do such things?"

"That's nonsense!" Nora was furious. "You wretch, stop slandering me! I've never wronged Victoria!"

"Never wronged her? Who falsely accused Victoria of plagiarism? Who claimed she used unethical means to get into Starry Studio Gallery? Who lured her to an abandoned factory for money, nearly getting her killed?" Elara's anger grew. "And now, you and your illegitimate son have imprisoned and beaten Victoria for money! And you still dare to ask her for a kidney? You're shameless! People like you don't deserve to live!"

"Shut up!" Nora screamed. "You wretch, I'll tear your mouth apart!"

"Bring it on, I'm not afraid of you!" Elara rolled up her sleeves, ready to fight.

She had long been fed up with Nora.

Victoria was such a good, obedient child. But she had the misfortune of having an unreliable mother, suffering for years.

Elara had been waiting for a chance to deal with Nora.

Today was the perfect opportunity!

She was determined to teach Nora a lesson!

Victoria watched in shock as the usually gentle Elara grabbed Nora's clothes, ready to fight.

She was stunned for a moment, then quickly ran over to break it up.

"Elara, Elara, don't do this. It's not worth it." Victoria hugged Elara's waist, stopping her from acting impulsively.

Elara struggled. "Victoria, let go. I need to teach her a lesson! This vile woman deserves to be cut to pieces!"

Victoria was deeply moved.

She knew Elara cared for her.

But she hadn't realized Elara remembered all her suffering and pain so clearly.

Not her biological mother, but better than one.

Victoria's eyes welled up with tears. She hugged Elara tightly, choking up. "Elara, calm down. Don't hurt yourself over someone not worth it."

Elara felt a warm surge in her heart. She patted Victoria's head. "Good girl, I'm fine. This wicked woman will get her comeuppance eventually."

Alvin had only heard a bit from Daisy, but he hadn't realized Nora had done so much to abuse Victoria. He was furious.

He gritted his teeth, yanked Nora away, and slapped her hard.

The slap echoed loudly.

Nora was stunned, unable to react for a moment.

"You... you hit me?" She stared at Alvin in shock, unable to believe her eyes.

One slap wasn't enough for Alvin. He raised his leg, ready to kick her.

He wanted to kill this vile Nora!

Daisy quickly intervened, stopping Alvin.

She frowned and scolded him softly. "Enough, calm down."

Victoria also hurried to calm him. "Dad, I'm fine, really."

"Fine? You call this fine?"

Alvin looked at Victoria with a trembling voice, full of pain.

He glared at Nora, pointing at her. "If you dare ask for Victoria's kidney, I'll kill you. An eye for an eye."

Nora, pale with fear, tried to call out sweetly, "Alvin!"

Daisy snapped impatiently, "Shut up!"

Victoria's heart tightened. She had finally gotten Alvin back and didn't want to lose him again. She quickly said, "No donation, no surgery. I'm not doing it!"

###chapter 146 Stay Away from My Daughter

Nora didn't dare make a sound. After living with Alvin for so many years, she knew his temperament well. He might seem gentle and polite on the surface, but deep down, he was incredibly stubborn. Once he made up his mind, no one could change it.

But Nora was quick-witted. She desperately needed Victoria's kidney to save her life and couldn't afford to mess things up now. She couldn't anger Victoria, nor could she offend Alvin.

"Alright, we won't do it. I know it's unfair to Victoria. She's still young and shouldn't have to make such a big sacrifice for me."

She even bowed slightly to Dr. Myers, apologizing proactively, "Dr. Myers, I'm really sorry for all the trouble I've caused you and the hospital."

Dr. Myers visibly relaxed, and perhaps it was just her imagination, but it seemed like the corners of his mouth lifted slightly.

He responded kindly, "It's alright. We always follow the patient's wishes. Your decision is respected."

Daisy glanced at Nora with a look full of mockery and stepped forward, "Dr. Myers, I'll go handle the paperwork with you. I'll cover all the costs."

"Alright."

After the two left, Elara happily started packing up. "Victoria, go home and rest with your dad. I'll take care of things here."

"Elara, thank you!"

"Don't mention it! Just go home already!"

Victoria was eager to spend some time alone with Alvin. She had so many questions and wanted to know how he had been all these years in prison.

"Dad, wait for me. I'll change my clothes."

"Okay." Alvin walked outside the ward to wait.

Nora stood to the side, looking as if she had been wronged.

Alvin, now in his prime, stood tall and strong, with broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and straight, powerful legs.

Nora's heart suddenly raced, especially realizing that this was the man who had been by her side for so many years.

Her feelings for Alvin had been like still water, lifeless and unmoving. But now, it was as if a pebble had been tossed in, sending ripples across the surface.

"Alvin," she called softly, her voice gentle and melodious, reminiscent of the times they were intimate, her whispers filled with emotion.

Alvin stood still, not even sparing her a glance.

The love he once felt so strongly for this woman had been chipped away by too many disappointments and hurts.

During his days of imprisonment, he had reflected deeply on the past.

Nora had never truly loved him, and Alvin had known this for a long time.

Through the years they had spent together, Alvin had gone from being full of hope and naivety to feeling utterly exhausted and scarred. 

He had given his all to this relationship and this family, with a clear conscience. He had offered his most passionate and pure feelings without reservation. 

But unfortunately, Nora had never cherished them, treating them like trash.

"Alvin?" Nora cautiously approached. Without the boost of high heels, the height difference between them was even more pronounced, making her look more fragile.

She looked up, her eyes greedily scanning Alvin's chiseled face, then slowly moving down to his firm chest. Her heartbeat quickened, as if she were a young girl again, experiencing her first crush.

Realizing her loss of composure, she shyly lowered her head, her voice becoming even softer, "Please don't be mad at me about Victoria, okay? I know I've been a terrible mother, not fulfilling my responsibilities. But you have to understand. Ever since you were taken in, I've been living in constant depression."

"Yet you seem to be taking care of Bobby just fine." Alvin's eyes were cold, devoid of any warmth.

Nora's face turned awkward, and she mumbled softly, "Don't listen to others. It's not like that. Bobby has been taking care of me."

"In that case, let him donate his kidney to you."

"That's impossible!" Nora's reaction was intense, blurting out without thinking.

Alvin didn't argue, just continued to look at her coldly, his gaze seemingly able to pierce through her.

"Alvin, please don't misunderstand. Bobby's kidney isn't a match for me. He wants to help, but he can't."

At that moment, Daisy walked in. Seeing her, Nora immediately fell silent.

She recognized Daisy. Back then, Daisy was only twenty, with a cold and aloof personality, always sitting alone at gatherings, not getting close to anyone.

Now, Daisy exuded the charm of a mature woman in her forties, showcasing her feminine allure to the fullest.

Nora couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy.

Daisy walked past her and directly asked Alvin, "Where's Victoria?"

"She's changing inside."

Daisy walked in, "Victoria, are you ready to go?"

"Yes, I'm ready." Victoria came out, gave Elara a few instructions, then, like when she was a child, affectionately linked her arm with Alvin's, her face beaming with happiness.

"Let's go." Alvin's eyes were full of love as he led Victoria out of the room.

Neither of them looked at Nora even once.

"Alvin, Victoria." Nora tried to catch up, but Daisy quickly blocked her path, and said calmly, "Nora, Dr. Myers mentioned that you still need to stay in the hospital for observation."

"But..."

Daisy cut her off, "If you can ask Victoria to donate a kidney to you, then you must know better than I do that nothing beats your own health, right?"

Nora was full of displeasure but had to hold it in, saying nothing.

Daisy was right. At the moment, nothing was more important than getting her health back on track.

Alvin stood in front of the villa, lost in thought.

He turned his head to look at Daisy, "Did he help you get this place?"

Daisy nodded slightly, not saying much.

Alvin understood that some topics, once opened, would only complicate things further, benefiting no one, especially regarding why William went to such lengths.

Daisy turned to leave.

"I'll walk you out." Alvin grabbed his coat and led the way.

Daisy watched his back and slowly followed.

They walked out the gate, strolling along the path in the neighborhood.

This villa area, though not as luxurious as the top-tier neighborhoods the Carter family used to live in, was still home to many elites. The location was excellent, and the environment was serene and peaceful.

Daisy broke the silence first, "Remember the last time you walked me home? I was about Victoria's age."

At twenty, a girl harbors so many innocent secrets.

Alvin kept his hands in his pockets, not responding, his head slightly lowered, lost in thought.

Daisy wasn't one to dwell on the past for long. She quickly set aside those memories and asked, "What are your plans now that you're back?"

Alvin lifted his head, his gaze firm, "Find a job and make money to support Victoria."

He vowed never to let Victoria suffer any more.

Daisy nodded, "If you need any help, just let me know."

"You've already helped me a lot. Now that I'm back, I need to walk my own path."

Daisy stopped, looking at him with a cold expression, "Do you have to be so distant with me?"

Alvin looked at her deeply, "I know you've helped me a lot, and I remember it all. I'll repay you someday."

"Do you think I helped you to get something in return?"

Alvin was silent for a moment, then said, "Can you pass a message to William for me?"

Daisy was slightly taken aback, having a vague idea of what he wanted to say.

"If he has any grudges, he can come after me. Even if he wants my life, I won't flinch. But please, stay away from Victoria. It's best if he never appears in her life again."

###chapter 147 Do Not See Him Anymore

Alvin's eyes were cold and determined. "I'd do anything for Victoria."

Daisy pursed her lips and spoke slowly, "Have you ever thought that maybe he..."

"It doesn't matter. Victoria doesn't need it. Your family are too complicated. I've been through enough, and I can't let Victoria be in danger again."

Daisy stared at him for a long time, sighed, and then turned to leave.

Alvin watched her disappear through the front door before turning back inside.

When he got home, Victoria was sitting on the living room couch, hugging her knees and staring off into space. Hearing the door open, she turned her head towards the stairs.

Seeing it was him, her previously dull expression instantly brightened.

"Dad!" she exclaimed, rushing over to hug Alvin's arm.

Alvin affectionately ruffled her hair. "What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you."

"I want your fried fish and fried chicken."

"Alright, I'll go get the groceries now," Alvin agreed with a smile.

Even though he used to be very busy with work, whenever he had free time, he would dive into the kitchen to cook for the family.

Alvin and Victoria chatted and laughed as they wandered through the supermarket, picking out the freshest ingredients.

Back home, Victoria eagerly helped wash and chop the vegetables.

Seeing how skilled she had become, Alvin realized that his once-cherished daughter must have endured a lot over the past two years.

The thought made his heart ache.

He reached out and gently touched Victoria's forehead, speaking softly, "I promise, I won't let anyone hurt you again."

Victoria's nose tingled, and she choked up, "It's okay, Dad. I've grown up. I can take care of myself."

Alvin patted her shoulder lovingly. "Silly girl, you'll always be my little girl."

Victoria sniffled and lowered her head to continue washing the vegetables.

Only in front of Alvin could she be the carefree little princess she once was.

By the time dinner was ready, it was dusk. The setting sun cast a golden glow inside the house, warm and peaceful.

Alvin and Victoria chatted as they ate.

Victoria excitedly shared stories about her job at Starry Studio Gallery and her upcoming entrance exam for the University of Aesthetics Shine.

Alvin listened quietly, occasionally chiming in, his eyes full of love.

But soon, Alvin's expression turned serious as he remembered something.

He didn't want to spoil the moment with harsh words, but he had to remind her, "Victoria, you need to stop seeing William."

Victoria paused, looking up at Alvin. "Why bring him up now?"

Alvin frowned slightly, noticing her mood drop, and felt a pang of worry. "Victoria, I'm not trying to ruin your mood, but William's family is too complicated. We can't afford to get involved with them, do you understand?"

Victoria's face fell, and she lowered her head, speaking softly, "Dad, you don't need to worry. William is getting married soon. There's nothing between us. Besides, I have a boyfriend now. His name is Samuel. I'll bring him to meet you someday."

Alvin sighed and patted her shoulder. "Alright, I trust you. When you have time, bring him over so I can meet him."

Victoria nodded and started clearing the table. As she turned away from Alvin, a tear fell silently.

Alvin had started his own business again. He was once the most renowned architect in Crystalia, but after two years in prison, his old connections were gone.

He needed to readjust to society after being away for over two years.

But he had built his career from scratch before and had real talent. He believed that with time, he could succeed again.

Despite his busy schedule, Alvin still made sure to cook three meals a day for Victoria.

Victoria felt sorry for Alvin but couldn't stop him. She knew that if he didn't get out there and try, he would be even more miserable.

Victoria was very considerate and never disturbed Alvin unnecessarily. She returned to Starry Studio Gallery and quickly got back into the swing of things. She diligently organized artwork, greeted clients, and tried to keep her life busy.

Whenever she had time, she visited Samuel in the hospital. Samuel was happy for Victoria when he heard Alvin had been released on bail. Victoria occasionally talked to him about Alvin. Samuel always listened patiently and offered advice and encouragement.

"Your dad's amazing. With his determination and courage, he'll definitely succeed. If he doesn't mind, I can introduce him to some resources."

Samuel was a respected figure in the art world, and his connections could greatly help Alvin. Although Victoria was tempted, she shook her head and declined his offer.

"Thanks, but I think my dad would prefer to achieve his goals on his own. I believe in him."

Besides, Victoria didn't want to trouble Samuel too much. 

Samuel was momentarily surprised but then smiled. "Too bad, I won't get a chance to impress my future father-in-law."

Victoria blushed and glared at him. "Stop talking nonsense."

"Alright, alright, my bad," Samuel surrendered with a smile. "I'll be discharged in a few days. You should introduce me to your dad then, right?"

Victoria paused while cutting an apple for him. She hesitated for a moment but finally nodded. "Okay, once my dad is less busy, I'll bring you home to meet him."

Samuel beamed. "Great, I'll be waiting for your call."

After leaving the hospital, Victoria went back to her old apartment. She still had some things to pack up. Today, she had some free time to go and get them.

When she unlocked the familiar door, a strong smell of alcohol hit her. The room was dim, with the curtains tightly closed. Only a few slivers of light seeped through the gaps, casting shadows on the messy room. Empty bottles were scattered all over the floor, and there were many unopened ones too. The ashtray was overflowing with cigarette butts.

William was passed out drunk on the cold tile floor, muttering "Victoria" in his sleep. His eyes were half-closed, his long lashes casting shadows on his cheeks. His flushed face made his handsome features even more striking.

Victoria stood at the door, staring for a long time, her heart aching. She slowly walked over, knelt down, and with trembling fingers, gently touched William's face. Her fingertips brushed his lips, feeling the warmth and moisture. She lightly touched his throat but quickly pulled back, as if scared, her breathing quickening.

They hadn't seen each other for over two weeks since their last meeting on the hospital rooftop. But she knew he had been silently protecting her all along. Including Alvin's release on bail, which must have cost William a lot.

Victoria's eyes reddened. She didn't want to hurt him. But she had no other choice but to push him away. There were too many obstacles between them, too deep to overcome.

Her eyes suddenly stung, as if pricked by needles. She blinked rapidly to push back the tears. Then she bent down, trying to lift William onto the couch. 

It was still early spring, and the floor was cold. Lying there all night would make him sick.

But as soon as she exerted force, William rolled over and pinned her down!

###chapter 148 Drunkenness

Victoria was startled and instinctively tried to break free.

But William held her tightly, pressing her head against his chest.

"Victoria, don't leave me, please don't leave me," he murmured.

Victoria froze, her eyes stinging with unshed tears, and all her struggles ceased.

For the past while, she had been trying desperately to forget him.

But now, his murmured pleas and the weight of his strong, unyielding body pressing down on her made her heart pound wildly, as if it would burst out of her chest!

"William, let go of me," she said, her voice hoarse and strained.

William seemed not to hear her, burying his head in her soft bosom, inhaling her unique scent greedily.

"Victoria, I was wrong, don't leave me." His voice was hoarse, like a dying man in his final struggle, evoking a sense of pity.

Victoria's nose tingled, and her heart felt even heavier, as if someone had punched her hard.

She took a deep breath, barely holding back her tears, and continued to persuade him, "William, you're drunk, let go."

But William only held her tighter, as if trying to merge her into his body.

"I'm not drunk," he mumbled indistinctly.

Victoria's eyelids twitched violently. She tried to push him away again, but William was like a block of iron, completely immovable.

"You really are drunk, let go of me," Victoria was at a loss, "I'll take you to the hospital, do you have any sobering medicine?"

William didn't respond but suddenly leaned in to kiss her.

Victoria was caught off guard, her whole body stiffening.

William's tongue forcefully pried open her lips, greedily plundering the sweetness of her mouth.

Victoria pushed him with all her might, but he only held her tighter.

William's body was heavy, and she used all her strength just to support him.

His lips were hot, scorching, and searing, attacking her with a storm-like intensity.

Victoria was kissed breathless, struggling desperately, but William gave her no chance to escape.

William's breathing grew heavier.

His large hand gripped her slender waist, holding her tightly, his warm hand caressing her smooth skin, making her shiver uncontrollably.

His hand moved upward, covering her full, soft breast.

Victoria felt a jolt of electricity run through her body, making her feel incredibly tingly.

She used the last of her rationality to resist the surging sensation.

"William, wake up, please wake up, don't do this to me," her voice quickened, almost pleading.

But William ignored her.

The alcohol had numbed his senses, he couldn't remember anything, the only thing he knew was that the woman beneath him was Victoria, the woman he loved most.

He grabbed Victoria's neck, forcing her disheveled self to look at him.

Victoria's makeup was half-smeared, her lipstick smudged on William's hand, which he slowly licked off.

A bit of red stained his tongue, like blood that hadn't fully faded.

"Victoria, I love you, you are mine," William suddenly said, flipping Victoria over so she was lying face down on the couch.

Then he tore off her silk panties, and without any foreplay, he thrust into her.

William let out a satisfied groan, grabbing Victoria's chin to force her to turn her head and kiss him, filling her mouth with his.

Victoria could clearly feel William's hot, hard presence moving inside her, pushing slowly but irresistibly.

"William, you can't!" Victoria screamed, but how could she push away a drunk man?

William's penis was thick and long, reaching her cervix, the pleasure too intense for her to focus.

William paused, then lightened his movements.

Even so, Victoria couldn't take it, biting her lip and gripping his arms tightly to suppress the pleasure coursing through her body.

Victoria's soft moans, mixed with William's low growls, filled the large room with an intimate, charged atmosphere.

Pinned beneath him, her legs raised and pressed tightly against William's hips, every inch of her skin, every sensitive spot, even every cell was teased by William, making her moan uncontrollably.

Her body trembled involuntarily, her cheeks flushed with a thin layer of sweat, her forehead beaded with perspiration.

Her breathing grew more erratic, her chest heaving, her body trembling with emotion.

The places where they were tightly connected grew hotter, like being roasted over a fire, pushing Victoria to the brink of collapse.

She moaned softly, the position making her feel especially embarrassed, her dress hanging loosely, and William's thrusts going deeper because of it.

She could feel the deepest part of her being repeatedly hit, a thin membrane that William surely knew how to break through.

She endured the intense pleasure, digging her fingers into his shoulders.

"Victoria, be good, bear with it, it'll be over soon," William whispered in her ear, soothing her anxiety and fear like a child.

Then, without warning, he pushed through the membrane, like an unstoppable blade, piercing the deepest softness in Victoria.

Victoria screamed, her body convulsing as if electrocuted, her vaginal walls contracting, muscles tightening. William closed his eyes and groaned, pressing Victoria's head down to kiss her.

He came!

William lay on top of Victoria, motionless.

Victoria, however, was breathing heavily, her chest heaving from the exertion. She wanted to push him away, but he was too heavy, and she had no strength left.

William opened his eyes, his deep gaze fixed on Victoria, filled with an overwhelming affection and adoration.

Victoria's face turned bright red, too embarrassed to look at William.

William smiled and kissed her, savoring her like the most delicious food.

His kisses trailed from her lips to her cheeks and neck, leaving a trail of wet marks.

"William, stop pretending. I know you're sober," Victoria huffed, her voice soft and sweet.

William stopped all his actions.

Victoria seized the moment, sitting up and hurriedly picking up her clothes to put them on.

After being tormented by William for so long, her whole body ached, and she could barely stand, leaning against the couch for support.

Seeing this, William quickly reached out to help her.

"What are you doing!" Victoria glared at him.

"Victoria, let me help you dress," William's voice was hoarse, his gaze fixed on her chest.

"Who needs your help? Get away, I'll do it myself." Victoria swatted his hand away and started dressing herself.

William didn't stop her, his eyes still locked on her chest.

Victoria kept her head down, tying her belt, feeling William's unwavering gaze on her.

Her heart started racing again.

Victoria didn't dare look up. Once she was dressed and ready to head to the door, she was pulled back by a strong force.

William held her, leaning in to kiss her.

Their lips intertwined, moving together.

Victoria's heart pounded like a drum, and she tried to push him away.

But William only held her tighter.

"Victoria, stay a little longer." His breath brushed her cheek, whispering softly.

Victoria was stunned for a moment, about to speak when a knock sounded at the door.

###chapter 149 I'll Pay It Back!

Victoria's heart skipped a beat. Who could it be? She quickly tidied her messy hair before slowly opening the door.

The moment the door opened, she felt like she had fallen into an ice-cold abyss. Standing there were her father, Alvin, and Alice, whose eyes were filled with venom.

Victoria's mind buzzed. How did they find this place?

"Dad!" Victoria called out, and at the same time, William heard her. His movements froze for a second.

Alvin shot Victoria a cold glance and walked straight into the room.

His eyes scanned the room, taking in William's disheveled appearance and Victoria's flushed cheeks. He instantly understood what had happened.

His face darkened with rage, and without a word, he swung his fist at William.

William didn't dodge, taking the punch squarely. Blood immediately trickled from the corner of his mouth.

"Dad!" Victoria screamed, rushing to shield William.

Alvin, as if he hadn't heard her, continued his assault, delivering a brutal kick to William's stomach.

William clutched his stomach and fell to his knees.

Victoria burst into tears. "Dad, please stop! Don't hit him anymore. It's my fault. If you want to blame someone, blame me. It has nothing to do with him."

Alice, seeing William being beaten, hurried over to help him.

"William, are you okay?" Alice asked worriedly.

"Get lost," William snapped coldly. "I don't need your fake concern."

"How can you say that? How is my concern fake? I'm your fiancée, and you two cheated on me behind my back. How is that my fault?" Alice's eyes welled up with tears.

William looked at her coldly, seeing through her act.

Alvin had found them because of Alice's scheming.

Alvin's eyes blazed with fury as he pointed at William and shouted, "You bastard! How dare you take advantage of my daughter! I told you, if you have a grudge, take it out on me! Do you think I don't know that you were behind the bridge collapse ten years ago that killed your parents? 

"And two years ago, you framed me for the sports arena collapse, sending me to prison. You did all this to bankrupt the Carter family and put me behind bars. Fine, I went to prison as you wished, but why do you still torment my daughter? You're relentless in your revenge!" As Alvin spoke, he threw another punch at William.

William gritted his teeth and took the hit without a sound.

Victoria stood there, stunned by Alvin's words, her body trembling and her eyes filling with tears.

No wonder William had initially paid her to be his mistress, and for the past two years, he had humiliated and abused her, allowing Ella and Alice to torment her, leading to online harassment, imprisonment, and near-death experiences.

The times he had saved her life were only because he hadn't finished his revenge, not out of any genuine care.

And she had foolishly believed he cared for her.

She had even fallen in love with him!

Victoria felt a cold chill wash over her, and tears streamed down her face.

"Victoria, it's not what you think," William tried to explain, his voice hoarse and urgent.

Victoria suddenly pushed him away, shouting angrily, "It's all a lie! William, you're despicable! I was stupid enough to believe you would help me investigate my dad's case, but it was all part of your plan! No wonder you never found the kidnappers when I was abducted. You were in on it with them! William, you're vile!"

Victoria screamed hysterically.

She hated William. She had trusted him, seen him as her support and safe haven, but he had cruelly shattered her dreams.

"Victoria, no, I could never be in league with your kidnappers," William pleaded desperately.

The more urgent his tone, the more guilty he seemed.

"Swear on your parents' names that those kidnappers weren't from the Scott family," Victoria demanded, her eyes filled with hatred.

William fell silent.

Though the kidnappers weren't his people, they could have been Wayne's.

But he couldn't explain that now.

Seeing William's silence, Victoria lost control.

She lunged at him, grabbing his collar and slapping him hard across the face.

A loud smack echoed, and red marks appeared on William's cheek.

"William, you bastard! You've been using and hurting me all along! I was heartbroken over you, and I was so stupid to believe you cared for me!"

"Victoria!" William grabbed her slender shoulders, his voice filled with pain. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."

"Shut up!" Victoria struggled wildly, shoving William away. "I'll never trust you again."

Victoria stumbled out of the room, and Alvin shot William a fierce glare before chasing after her.

Victoria ran, crying uncontrollably. Her mind was blank, as if she were lost in a fog, unable to see the way forward.

She ran aimlessly, tirelessly.

One thought echoed in her mind: "William, I hate you."

Alice hadn't expected things to escalate so dramatically.

She was secretly delighted by the outcome but kept her composure.

Seeing the slap mark on William's face, she put on a worried expression and approached him. "William, does it hurt? Let me..."

Before she could finish, William suddenly raised his hand and slapped her hard.

"Are you happy now?" William's voice was icy, his teeth clenched.

Alice clutched her stinging cheek, tears welling up. "William!"

William sneered, mocking her. "Alice, your acting has always been terrible."

Alice was stunned.

William calmly wiped the blood from his lips, taunting, "You think that with Victoria out of the picture, I'd be with you? You're delusional. Even without Victoria, I'd never be with you."

"William!" Alice dropped her pretense, her voice sharp. "Have you forgotten that I was gang-raped because I saved you? You owe me your life! You have to take responsibility! You can't leave me!"

"I owe you my life?" William repeated softly, a look of sorrow and despair in his eyes. "Fine, I'll pay it back!"

As he spoke, William picked up a nearby fruit knife and plunged it into his own abdomen.

###chapter 150 Suicide

The sharp sound of a knife piercing flesh echoed through the room.

William let out a muffled groan, and bright red blood trickled down the handle, pooling on the pristine white floor.

"William!" Alice screamed, her face pale with fear.

William clutched his abdomen, panting heavily, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Seeing him in such pain, Alice quickly helped him sit down.

"Call an ambulance, now!" she urgently instructed the bodyguard standing outside the door.

Alvin hadn't expected Victoria to be in so much pain, and he felt a pang of regret.

If he had known it would turn out like this, he wouldn't have gone along with Alice's plan to find them. He just wanted Victoria to break up with William for good.

The Scott family's situation was too complicated, and Victoria was too kind-hearted and naive. William was not right for her.

But who could have predicted this outcome?

He had chased Victoria all the way back home.

As soon as Victoria got home, she slammed the door shut.

Alvin knew she was in a state of emotional collapse, and it wasn't the right time to talk. He could only wait outside for her to process everything.

Victoria curled up on her bed, hugging herself, silent tears streaming down her cheeks.

William, William, how could you be so cruel?

Her vision blurred, and her tears soaked the pillow.

She had never doubted William's feelings for her, but at this moment, she realized how wrong she had been.

She had foolishly fallen in love with an enemy!

Victoria lay on the bed in a daze, memories of William's handsome, gentle face, his affectionate smiles, and his kisses flashing before her eyes, as if it all happened just yesterday.

It was all a lie.

******

The next morning, Victoria opened her eyes to find the room filled with daylight.

She stared blankly at the light seeping through the curtains for a long time.

She groggily opened the door to go to the bathroom, but stopped in her tracks.

Alvin was curled up by the door, leaning against the wall, his head drooping wearily. It was clear he had been sitting there all night.

His hair was disheveled, streaked with gray, and the morning light made it look even more striking.

His face was etched with exhaustion and weariness, and his usually straight back was slightly hunched, as if he had aged ten years overnight.

Victoria's heart tightened, and her eyes instantly welled up with tears.

She never expected Alvin to stay by the door all night.

Last night, she had been heartbroken, crying her eyes out in her room, completely oblivious to Alvin's feelings. Now, thinking back, Alvin must have been in just as much pain.

"Dad," she called softly, her voice thick with tears.

Alvin's body trembled, and he slowly lifted his head, his bloodshot eyes filled with worry and affection as he looked at Victoria. "Victoria, you're awake."

He tried to stand up, but his legs were numb from sitting too long, and he almost fell.

Victoria quickly supported Alvin, her hand touching his cold arm, and she couldn't hold back her tears any longer. "Dad, why did you sit here all night? You didn't have to."

Alvin steadied himself and gently patted Victoria's hand, forcing a smile. "I was worried about you. Hearing you cry in your room last night broke my heart. I know you're hurting, but I don't want to see you give up. The Carter family has been through so much, but as long as we have each other, we can get through anything."

Victoria threw herself into Alvin's arms, sobbing uncontrollably. "Dad, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been so impulsive and made you worry."

She thought about her attitude towards Alvin last night and felt a deep sense of regret. Alvin had already sacrificed so much for the family and endured so much suffering. How could she continue to be so reckless?

Alvin held Victoria, gently stroking her hair. "Hey, it's not your fault. I should have protected you better. I promise you, I won't let you suffer like this again."

They held each other for a long time until Victoria's emotions gradually calmed down.

She sniffled and said, "Dad, don't worry. I'm okay now."

Alvin released her and looked at her kindly. "Really?"

Victoria nodded firmly, forcing a smile. "It's just a guy. Besides, it was never going to work out between us. I won't waste my tears on someone like him."

Alvin was relieved to hear her words. "That's the spirit. As long as you can move on, I'll be at ease. Now go freshen up, and I'll make you breakfast."

******

When Daisy arrived at the hospital, William was in surgery.

She walked up to Alice and suddenly slapped her across the face.

Alice was caught off guard and stunned by the blow.

"Alice, if anything happens to William, I'll kill you!" Daisy roared.

Her eyes were filled with a chilling fury, and she looked like she wanted to tear Alice apart.

Alice clutched her reddened cheek, her eyes dim. "I'm sorry, Ms. Scott. I never thought things would turn out this way."

Daisy laughed bitterly. "Alice, I thought you were a bit crazy, but I believed you genuinely loved William, so I didn't oppose your relationship or even your marriage. But look at what you've done. Do you know how many times he's been hurt because of you?"

Alice gritted her teeth, saying nothing.

Daisy sneered. "I'm warning you, stay away from William from now on. Stop bringing him trouble!"

Alice's eyes reddened, and she shook her head. "I can't leave William. Without him, I'd die."

Daisy gave her a look of disgust. "Enough. Whether you live or die is none of my business. You better pray William is okay, or else..."

Before she could finish, the door to the operating room opened, and the doctor wheeled William out.

Daisy and Alice rushed over. "Doctor, how is he?"

The doctor removed his mask, revealing a face that was both unfamiliar and familiar. "William lost a lot of blood and is out of immediate danger, but..."

Daisy and Alice's faces paled.

The doctor sighed. "He needs to stay in the hospital for observation. If his recovery doesn't go well, he might need to be moved to the ICU."

"Thank you," Daisy said politely, nodding in gratitude.

Alice stood in a daze for a moment, then hurried to William's bedside, leaning over him and whispering, "William, wake up."

Daisy stared at William's pale face, her brows furrowed.

Seeing Alice so worried, she knew it would be impossible to make her leave.

This was a hospital, and forcibly dragging Alice out could cause a scene. If things got out of hand and affected the Scott family's reputation, it would be bad.

After much consideration, Daisy finally decided to hold back her anger and wait until William woke up to deal with it.

###chapter 151 Surprise

After breakfast, Victoria put an ice pack on her swollen eyes and applied a bit more makeup than usual before heading to work.

Before she left, Alvin noticed how tired she looked and suggested, "Why don't you take the day off?"

Victoria shook her head and gave a small, wry smile. "I've already taken a lot of time off. Ms. Simpson's been really understanding, but I don't want to push it."

Alvin sighed and said, "Why not just quit? You need to focus on your University of Aesthetics Shine exams. I can support you."

Victoria smiled softly. "Dad, Starry Studio Gallery is one of the top galleries in the country. I worked really hard to get in, and I'm learning things there that I can't learn in school. I need to seize this opportunity."

Alvin frowned, hesitated for a moment, and then said, "I won't force you, but don't overdo it. If you get too tired, let me know."

"Don't worry, Dad. I know my limits." Victoria took a deep breath, clenched her fists, and resolutely walked out the door.

Alvin watched her slender figure disappear, feeling a mix of pride and concern.

Victoria was so determined!

Just as he turned to go back inside, his phone rang. It was Daisy.

******

Victoria mustered her energy and arrived at Starry Studio Gallery. As soon as she stepped inside, Wendy noticed something was off.

Victoria's usually bright eyes were dull, and her face was pale, as if she'd been through something tough.

"Victoria, are you okay?" Wendy put down the frame she was organizing and asked with concern.

Not wanting to worry her, Victoria forced a smile and said with a slight nasal tone, "Just a bit of a cold. I might not be at my best, but don't worry."

Wendy looked at her skeptically. "Are you sure?"

Victoria nodded. "Yeah, I'm fine."

She went to her workstation and buried herself in her tasks, avoiding further conversation.

Seeing Victoria's preoccupied look, Wendy didn't press further. She gently patted Victoria's shoulder and quietly made her a steaming cup of coffee.

Victoria looked up and smiled gratefully.

After finishing the coffee, Victoria felt more energized and pushed her worries aside, focusing entirely on her work.

She meticulously cleaned the glass displays, making sure every corner was spotless, which helped lift her spirits a bit.

When interacting with customers, she maintained her professionalism and enthusiasm, patiently explaining the features and background of each artwork.

Her dedication and knowledge impressed the customers, who left satisfied and praised her expertise.

The compliments from the customers significantly improved Victoria's mood.

Indeed, work was the best remedy for her troubles.

Victoria managed to get through the day with renewed vigor.

As she was packing up to leave, she heard a commotion outside.

She paused and looked out to see a handsome man in a light gray cashmere coat and gold-rimmed glasses standing at the gallery entrance with a bouquet of roses.

He was tall and well-built, with striking features and an air of refined elegance, like a noble from a bygone era.

Not only was he familiar to Victoria, but many of her colleagues recognized him too.

"Isn't that Professor Brown from the University of Aesthetics Shine? What's he doing here?" one colleague exclaimed.

Another chimed in, "He's holding flowers. Is he here to confess to someone?"

"Who could be so lucky to catch Professor Brown's eye?"

"Professor Brown is known for being aloof and distant. Could he be interested in someone from our gallery?"

The staff buzzed with speculation.

Samuel stood quietly, a gentle smile on his lips.

His gaze cut through the crowd, landing directly on Victoria.

Victoria was momentarily stunned.

Wasn't he supposed to be discharged the day after tomorrow?

Why was he here early?

A wave of inexplicable guilt washed over her, but she quickly suppressed it.

She hurriedly gathered her things and walked out.

As soon as Samuel saw her, his smile deepened. He handed her the roses and said softly, "Victoria, I'm here to pick you up."

Her colleagues' eyes widened in shock.

"Oh my God! Professor Brown is really pursuing Victoria! Am I seeing this right?"

"Victoria is so lucky! She's both Joshua's student and Professor Brown's love interest."

"I'm so jealous!"

Wendy watched the scene unfold, feeling happy for Victoria.

Samuel was much more reliable than William. Victoria would surely be happy with him.

Victoria looked at the vibrant roses in her hand, feeling a mix of emotions.

"Samuel, weren't you supposed to be discharged the day after tomorrow? Why are you out early?" she asked quietly.

"I wanted to surprise you," Samuel replied with a warm smile, his eyes full of affection. "Are you happy?"

Victoria lowered her gaze, contemplating for a moment. "I'm very happy."

Samuel's eyes darkened slightly as he gazed at her.

He reached out and gently tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his tone indulgent. "What's wrong? You seem a bit down."

Victoria bit her lip and said softly, "Nothing, just a bit hungry."

Samuel chuckled. "Then let me take you to get something good to eat."

He took her hand and led her to a black Bentley parked nearby.

They arrived at a quiet restaurant and chose a window seat.

Samuel thoughtfully pulled out her chair and ordered her favorite dishes.

While waiting for their food, Samuel rested his chin on his hands and quietly watched Victoria. Suddenly, he spoke, "Victoria, I know something's on your mind. If you want, you can talk to me. Even if I can't help, at least let me share your burden."

Victoria looked out at the bustling street, silent for a long time.

Finally, she seemed to make a decision. She turned to Samuel and said slowly, "Samuel, let's go public."

"Go public?" Samuel raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise in his eyes.

He hadn't expected Victoria to suggest it, but he was delighted by her initiative.

"Yes, let's post on social media and announce our relationship. Is that okay?" Victoria's voice was soft.

###chapter 152 Relationship Goes Public

"Of course, I'd love to," he said without a second thought.

He knew she had other reasons for wanting to go public, but for him, becoming her official boyfriend was something he had longed for.

Victoria let out a sigh of relief, a faint smile appearing on her face. She took out her phone, gently wrapped her arm around Samuel's, and rested her head on his shoulder, finding the perfect angle to take a selfie of the two of them.

In the photo, Samuel had a gentle smile on his lips, his eyes full of affection, while Victoria leaned on his shoulder, looking delicate and sweet.

They made a striking couple, handsome and beautiful, perfectly matched.

A simple photo, yet it captured a sense of timeless tranquility.

Victoria typed a simple caption: [Boyfriend.]

She attached the photo and hit send.

Almost instantly, her phone started buzzing non-stop with notifications.

Elara sent a heart emoji along with a voice message: "Victoria, I'm so happy to see you find happiness!"

Wendy sent a string of exclamation marks: [I knew you two were perfect for each other, so sweet!]

Diana commented: [Congrats on finding love! Stay happy forever!]

Alvin even called, his voice filled with relief. "Victoria, I saw your post. As long as you're happy, I'm at ease. This guy looks good; bring him home sometime so I can officially meet him.

"I have to go to the neighboring city for something today. Stay safe at home, and I'll make you something delicious when I get back tomorrow."

Looking at all the well-wishes, Victoria's initial hesitation slowly turned into determination.

Forget about those who aren't worth it and the unpleasant things. The world is so beautiful, she should cherish the happiness in front of her.

Samuel sat beside Victoria, quietly listening to her phone conversations, the warmth in his eyes growing deeper.

He also posted on his feed.

But he didn't have many friends.

Just a few colleagues and students from school sending their blessings.

And then there was Ryan's message: [Way to go, Samuel! Finally made it, huh? You gotta treat us to a meal now that you've won the beauty!]

Samuel chuckled and agreed.

He knew Victoria still had many ties to William.

But so what? Someone who doesn't know how to cherish her doesn't deserve her.

Samuel thought, gripping his phone, looking at Victoria's serene profile, his gaze growing more intense.

After dinner, Samuel drove Victoria home.

The car slowly came to a stop in front of her house. Victoria sat in the passenger seat, her fingers unconsciously tracing the door handle, her eyes looking out at her front door.

Samuel seemed to sense her hesitation and asked, "What's wrong?"

Victoria hesitated for a long moment before turning to Samuel and softly saying, "Come up for a bit."

Her voice had a slight tremor, which Samuel keenly noticed.

Samuel's eyes darkened instantly, his voice hoarse as he asked, "Victoria, you know what this means, right?"

Victoria bit her lip and softly replied, "Yes, I know. You're my boyfriend."

"Yes." Samuel responded in a low, deep voice, "Alright, baby."

With that, he leaned in and kissed Victoria's lips, deeply and passionately.

Victoria closed her eyes, letting Samuel kiss her, her heart racing.

Samuel's kiss was intense and passionate, claiming every inch of her, as if he wanted to devour her whole. She had never imagined that someone as gentle and refined as Samuel could have such a side.

Victoria was breathless from his kiss, her hands pressed against his strong chest.

After a long while, he reluctantly pulled away from her lips.

Looking at her flushed face, Samuel's throat moved, his voice hoarse, "Victoria, let's go upstairs. I feel like I'm about to explode."

Victoria lowered her eyes, not daring to look at Samuel's eyes filled with desire.

She didn't know if this decision was a mistake, but she knew that only by doing this could she truly rid herself of William's influence.

Though it was unfair to Samuel, she had no other choice.

Victoria nodded slightly, opened the car door, and led Samuel into her house.

*****

VIP ward at the hospital

William lay in bed, an IV in his hand, his handsome face pale and bloodless.

He opened his eyes, staring blankly at the white ceiling.

Upon waking, the first thing that came to his mind was Victoria's face-her shyness, fear, stubbornness, and the look of terror and disgust when she left him yesterday.

All her emotions flashed through his mind, disrupting his thoughts, almost shattering his soul.

He reached out to touch his chest, as if he could still feel the tearing pain there.

William closed his eyes, his long lashes casting shadows over his sharp nose.

He had never regretted anything as much as he did now, regretting how he had hurt her.

"William, you're awake?"

Alice pushed the door open, seeing William's clenched fist and the IV tube half-filled with backflowing blood. She was terrified and quickly called for medical staff.

Seeing this, William's cold eyes swept over everyone, finally landing on Alice's face. His voice was icy, "Who let you in? Get out!"

"William!" Alice was extremely aggrieved, tears welling up in her eyes.

William's thick brows furrowed, his tone growing colder, "Get out."

His voice was so cold it sent a chill through the room, making the medical staff shiver.

"William, please don't get agitated. Listen to me, okay? Your wounds haven't healed yet. I'm worried they'll reopen."

She choked up, stepping forward to grab William's other hand that wasn't hooked to the IV.

William pushed her away, using so much force that his abdominal wound tore open again, oozing blood.

Alice was stunned by his actions, staring at William in shock, murmuring, "William!"

William's face was as pale as paper, sweat beading on his forehead.

This fragile William was heart-wrenching.

He stared at her, his eyes filled with undisguised hatred, "Alice, let's break up. I've wasted your time, and I'll compensate you with three hundred million dollars."

"I don't need money!" Alice shouted, tears streaming down her face, "William, why do you have to be so cruel to me? You're hurt like this, and she hasn't even come to see you. I'm the only one who truly loves you. Why can't you love me?"

###chapter 153 Breakup

William's eyes suddenly turned icy as he snapped, "Enough!"

He glared at Alice with a cold expression. "You can't force feelings. I don't love you, and dragging this out won't help either of us. If you keep bugging me, don't blame me for handing you over to your stepmother, Willow. I'm sure she and Ella would love that."

Alice's whole body trembled at his words, and she stared at William in disbelief.

She shivered, knowing that once William made up his mind, he wouldn't change it.

The memory of being watched and controlled abroad still terrified her.

To get rid of her, he could be so heartless.

As Daisy pushed the door open, Alice ran out, heartbroken and in tears.

Daisy frowned, looking at the weak William on the hospital bed. "What happened to her? Why is she crying so hard?"

William furrowed his brow and said indifferently, "I broke up with her."

Daisy raised an eyebrow. "Really?"

"Yeah."

"Good." Daisy shrugged and sighed. "You two were never right for each other. Why torture yourselves by staying together?"

Then, as if remembering something, Daisy's eyes sharpened. She walked quickly to William's bedside and jabbed his shoulder angrily. "You! You never let anyone rest easy! Playing with your life like that, do you know how worried I was? If something happened to you, how would I explain it to your deceased parents?"

Her eyes reddened, and her voice choked with emotion.

William had never seen Daisy like this, and he felt a pang of guilt.

For the past ten years, Daisy had been more than a mother to him, caring for him meticulously.

But he was too stubborn, always making Daisy worry.

He pressed his lips together and softly reassured her, "Aunt Daisy, I promise I won't do anything foolish again."

Daisy snorted. "Save those promises. I don't buy it."

William fell silent.

He took a deep breath and softened his voice. "Aunt Daisy, I really know I was wrong. I know you mean well, and I've let you down."

Daisy shook her head, her eyes moist. "Silly boy, you're my nephew. I just want the best for you."

She wiped away her tears and smiled. "Alright, take care of yourself. I have to go to the company and hold down the fort for you."

She stood up, ready to leave.

"Aunt Daisy!" William called out, his tone hesitant. "Um..."

Daisy paused and looked back at William.

William seemed to want to say something but fell silent again.

Seeing his hesitation, Daisy knew what he was thinking. She said softly, "I know you want to ask about Victoria."

She paused, then added, "Don't worry. She's always been strong. She went to work as usual today."

William was taken aback, a hint of bitterness on his face. "That's good."

Daisy sighed at his expression. "William, she doesn't know you're hurt. I called her dad, and he was adamant about not letting you disrupt her life anymore. Give each other some space."

William's eyes dimmed, and he clenched the blanket tightly. After a long silence, he said in a low voice, "I understand, Aunt Daisy. I won't bother her again."

She must hate him.

If he were in her shoes, he'd want to kill the person who treated him like that.

William closed his eyes, exhausted, lying on the bed, his face even paler than before.

Daisy looked at his desolate expression, feeling a pang of sorrow. She hesitated but then advised, "William, there are too many obstacles between you and Victoria. It's not something that can be resolved quickly. If you really care about her, focus on getting better first, then think about other things."

"I get it," William replied, his voice muffled.

Daisy patted his back. "I'll head to the company now. I'll come back to see you after the afternoon meeting."

With that, she turned and left the room.

After Daisy left, the room fell into a brief silence.

Soon, hurried footsteps approached, and Harry rushed into the room.

He stopped abruptly at the door, his lips trembling as if he had something difficult to say.

William glanced at him, his gaze indifferent. Seeing Harry's hesitation, he felt a surge of impatience. "Spit it out."

Harry swallowed hard and walked to the bedside, pulling out his phone. He handed it to William, showing him Victoria's latest post. "Mr. Scott, you should see this."

William frowned and reached for the phone. As soon as he saw the screen, his expression froze.

On the screen, Victoria was leaning intimately on Samuel's shoulder, smiling sweetly, looking happy and beautiful.

The caption read: [Boyfriend.]

It felt like an invisible hand was squeezing his heart, the pain spreading through his body, making it hard to breathe.

His knuckles turned white as he gripped the phone, veins bulging from the effort.

Harry, seeing his reaction, was startled and quickly reminded him, "Mr. Scott, the doctor warned you not to get upset. If your wound reopens, it'll be trouble."

As soon as he finished speaking, there was a loud crash. The phone fell from William's hand, shattering on the floor.

Harry tried to catch it but missed, looking at the broken pieces with a pained expression.

It was his phone, and this was the umpteenth one William had broken.

William stared at the shattered phone, his gaze dark and brooding.

"Mr. Scott!" Harry called out cautiously, then hesitantly added, "The bodyguards we sent to protect Ms. Carter reported that Samuel took her out for dinner with roses and went into her house when he dropped her off."

His voice grew quieter, almost inaudible by the last few words, not daring to look at William's face.

William's face turned ashen, the light in his eyes fading, replaced by endless pain and despair.

His fists clenched tightly, knuckles white from the pressure, his body trembling uncontrollably.

A mouthful of blood spurted from his mouth, staining the white sheets with a glaring red.

"Mr. Scott!" Harry's eyes widened in horror as he scrambled to press the call button, but William stopped him.

William wiped the blood from his mouth, his eyes empty, his voice hoarse and weak. "Leave. Let me be alone."

###chapter 154 Sorry

"Mr. Scott."

"Get out!" His voice was thick with sorrow, and his eyes were clouded with despair.

Harry clenched his teeth and backed out, closing the door behind him.

The room fell silent again, with only the sound of William's heavy breathing filling the space.

He closed his eyes, and images of Victoria and Samuel together flooded his mind. The beautiful memories he had shared with Victoria now felt like the sharpest blades, cutting deep into his heart.

He never thought Victoria would leave him so ruthlessly, discarding all their love as if it never existed.

William felt a dull, unbearable pain in his chest as warm blood seeped from the wound in his abdomen.

Ignoring it, he slowly pulled the blanket up over his body, curling into a ball as the warmth of the blood soaked through his clothes and spread out.

******

Samuel held Victoria's hand as they walked into the room.

The door closed softly behind them, and the atmosphere instantly became intimate and charged.

Samuel looked at Victoria's delicate face, his throat dry and his heart pounding so hard it felt like it might burst out of his chest.

Sensing his intense gaze, Victoria took a small step back, trying to avoid getting too close.

A flicker of disappointment crossed Samuel's eyes, but he quickly smiled brightly. "Victoria, I've waited so long for this day."

His voice was deep and gentle, like a fine wine, intoxicating.

Victoria looked up into his eyes, seeing her reflection and the overflowing love within them.

She parted her lips slightly but didn't know what to say.

Seeing this, a hint of hurt flashed in Samuel's eyes, but he still stepped forward gently, pulling her into his arms, resting his chin on her head as if he were holding the most precious treasure in the world.

"Victoria, if you regret this, it's not too late to stop," Samuel coaxed softly.

Victoria hesitated, then shook her head and whispered, "I don't regret it."

Her answer made Samuel's heart leap with joy.

He held her slender waist tighter, as if trying to merge her into his very being, forever part of his soul.

Samuel's lips pressed against the hair on her forehead, greedily inhaling her unique scent.

Victoria's body stiffened, not daring to move.

Samuel's kisses were hot and lingering, his hands caressing her soft skin, finally resting on her neck, gently stroking, sending shivers down her spine.

Victoria's body tensed further, her breathing deepened, and her eyes filled with a layer of warm tears.

Samuel lowered his head, taking her sensitive earlobe into his mouth, gently nibbling, causing her to tremble.

Victoria's body jolted, and she instinctively pushed against Samuel. "Samuel!"

Her voice trembled, tinged with helplessness.

Samuel ignored her, continuing to kiss and nibble on her earlobe, his tongue slowly parting her lips, seeking her warmth.

His kisses were tender and reverent, treating her like a rare treasure, not wanting to hurt her in the slightest.

But Victoria's heart was filled with conflict and unease. While she felt the intimacy, an invisible barrier kept her from fully giving in.

Her body trembled slightly in Samuel's embrace, feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of his emotions.

With a gasp, Samuel lifted her and carried her to the bed, gently laying her down on the soft, spacious mattress.

He leaned over her, kissing her moist, red lips.

His kisses were as gentle as water, lightly pecking at her lips.

The distance between them was less than an inch, their noses touching, warm breaths mingling.

Victoria lay on the bed, eyes closed, long lashes trembling, breathing uneasily.

Samuel's kisses trailed down her long neck, finally nibbling at her collarbone, causing Victoria to shiver.

Samuel chuckled softly, using his finger to playfully tap her pink nose. "Don't be afraid, sweetheart."

Victoria kept her eyes closed, silent, as if resigned to Samuel's caresses.

Seeing this, Samuel's heart ached. He gently unbuttoned her shirt, revealing her delicate, sensual body.

Samuel's breathing quickened, his large hands caressing her chest through the thin fabric, creating a wave of heat.

Victoria's body arched slightly, showing her inner turmoil.

Samuel's hand slid down her back, finally resting on her slender thigh, his fingers teasing, sparking intimate flames.

Samuel's breathing grew heavier, his gaze falling on her underwear. He swallowed hard, removing his clothes, standing naked before Victoria.

Samuel's body was lean and muscular, his chest broad, six-pack abs clearly defined, exuding male hormones, showing he worked out regularly.

But compared to William, he was still slimmer.

Victoria hesitated, biting her lip.

Hadn't she told herself repeatedly not to think about William anymore?

Why couldn't she control her heart from fluttering because of him?

"Victoria," Samuel murmured, his voice hoarse and restrained.

He slowly leaned down, turning Victoria to face him.

Samuel's eyes were bright and shining, and as he moved, Victoria felt something hard pressing against her softest spot, burning hot.

Staring at her beautiful, pure face, Samuel's lips moved, his voice raspy. "Victoria, is this okay?"

Samuel's words were like a bomb, exploding in Victoria's heart.

Her face turned pale instantly. She struggled to sit up, grabbing a towel to cover herself. "I'm sorry, Samuel, I can't do this!"

Victoria's expression was panicked, almost frantic, tears welling up in her eyes, ready to spill over.

Her reaction made Samuel's pupils contract sharply, his body tensing, throat tightening, a strong desire rising within him, making him want to tear the towel away and take her.

But he couldn't bear to hurt her.

Samuel sighed, climbing off her, struggling to control his emotions, his voice hoarse. "Sorry, I'll go to the bathroom."

###chapter 155 She Hates Me

Samuel grabbed his clothes and turned to open the bathroom door in Victoria's bedroom, closing it gently behind him.

Even now, he was still so gentle. The soft click of the door felt like a heavy blow to Victoria's heart.

She had hurt him deeply once again.

In the bathroom, Samuel's erection was painfully hard. His handsome face was etched with unbearable pain.

The woman he loved was just on the other side of the wall, but he couldn't touch her. Every second felt like torture.

"Victoria," Samuel murmured softly, looking down at his rigid member with a bitter smile.

Thinking of Victoria's seductive look just moments ago, he had no choice but to take care of himself quickly.

Victoria dressed and listened to Samuel's muffled breathing from the bathroom, feeling overwhelmed with guilt.

She had invited him up, said she had no regrets, but then stopped him at the last moment.

Covering her face, Victoria felt a wave of self-loathing. How could she be so selfish?

Samuel stayed in the bathroom for a long time, taking a cold shower to calm himself down. Once he felt more composed, he dressed and slowly opened the bathroom door.

He immediately saw Victoria curled up in the corner of the bed, her cheeks stained with tears, looking pitiful.

Samuel's heart ached. He walked over to her and gently held her shoulders.

"Victoria, why are you crying?" Samuel asked softly, wiping away her tears.

"I'm sorry," Victoria choked out, her voice breaking, her eyes red.

She knew how hard it was for a man to stop at the last moment.

But he had respected her wishes.

Samuel's heart softened. He pulled Victoria into his arms, gently patting her back, soothing her with his voice. "Silly girl, you're just not ready yet. We'll take it slow, okay?"

Samuel's voice had a calming effect, gradually easing Victoria's guilt and helping her regain her composure.

Victoria looked up at Samuel, her eyes filled with confusion.

"I won't force you," Samuel said, cupping her face and wiping away her tears with his thumb, his voice gentle.

"Thank you, Samuel," Victoria said, her voice trembling.

She was truly grateful for Samuel's patience and affection. She had never experienced such feelings before and didn't know how to reciprocate.

Victoria wrapped her arms around Samuel's strong waist, pressing her face against his warm chest, inhaling the scent of his body wash. She kept telling herself to cherish him and to forget William completely.

Samuel let Victoria lean against him for a long time before speaking softly. "Victoria, my grandfather's birthday is coming up. Will you come with me?"

Victoria was taken aback and looked up at Samuel.

He looked tired, with dark circles under his eyes.

After a moment of thought, Victoria decided to agree.

They were officially a couple now. If she didn't attend Samuel's grandfather's birthday party, it would embarrass him.

Victoria bit her lip and asked softly, "When is it?"

Samuel's eyes sparkled with a hint of a smile. "Next Saturday."

Victoria nodded. "Okay."

"Get some rest. I'll head out now."

Samuel stood up, stopping Victoria from getting up to see him out. He straightened her messy blanket and left her home.

His back was straight, but there was a hint of loneliness in his posture.

Victoria lowered her eyes, hiding the overwhelming guilt she felt.

She knew she wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.

******

The news of William and Alice's breakup spread quickly, with all sorts of rumors flying around, but both parties remained silent.

By the time Eugene heard the news and rushed to the hospital, William's injuries had mostly healed.

But he had lost a lot of weight, and his once handsome face was now gaunt and haggard.

Eugene couldn't believe how much William had changed in just a few days. "What happened to you? Did you hurt yourself because you were heartbroken over Alice?"

William glanced at him, his voice calm. "Who told you that?"

Eugene was taken aback, then scoffed. "Everyone knows you and Alice broke up."

William's eyes narrowed, and he spoke quietly. "We did break up, but I didn't hurt myself out of heartbreak. I did it to get rid of her."

Eugene was shocked. "You risked your life just to break up with her? Are you crazy?"

Eugene had known William since they were kids. He knew William wouldn't give up on Alice unless something serious had happened.

"What else could I do?" William's face was pale, his stomach still wrapped in thick bandages. "I owed her. I had to repay her."

"All for Victoria? My God, you're out of your mind!" Eugene couldn't believe it. He paced the hospital room, furious at William's reckless behavior.

"You and Alice are both insane! She was devoted to you, losing herself in the process, and you turn around and risk everything for another woman. What did I do in a past life to deserve knowing you two?"

William reached out his hand. "Lighter."

Eugene glared at him but handed over the lighter.

William lit a cigarette, taking a deep drag. His eyes were distant, lost in the smoke.

Eugene frowned. "You and Alice..."

William took another drag, then looked up at the night sky, exhaling a cloud of smoke with a bitter smile.

He didn't say a word, but Eugene seemed to understand everything.

He patted William's shoulder, then hesitated when he saw the bandages. With a sigh, he said, "Forget it. Just let it be."

Even though William had always kept his promises, feelings based on guilt and obligation could easily fade, leaving only exhaustion and mutual harm.

"So, what now? Are you going to be with Victoria?" Eugene asked suddenly.

William lowered his eyes. The proud man looked pained, as if his soul had been drained.

"She's with someone else now," he said lightly.

Eugene was stunned.

He couldn't believe someone had taken William's woman.

"That's not like you. Didn't you think about fighting for her?" Eugene couldn't help but ask. "William, I don't get you. If you like her, go after her! As long as she's not married, anything can happen."

William let out a bitter laugh, his eyes fixed on a distant point. "She hates me. She'll never forgive me."

###chapter 156 Birthday Banquet

Eugene glanced at the downcast William, suddenly unsure of what to say.

Man, love really is a killer, he thought. Even someone as proud and untouchable as William had been brought to his knees by it.

Eugene was about to offer some comforting words when his phone buzzed in his pocket.

He pulled it out, checked the screen, and answered the call.

The person on the other end spoke softly, and Eugene listened carefully before quickly agreeing.

After hanging up, he slipped his phone back into his pocket and looked up to find William's gaze fixed on him.

"William, what's wrong?" he asked, feeling a bit unnerved by the intensity.

"Is it Mr. Brown's birthday party?" William raised an eyebrow. "I'll go with you."

Eugene was caught off guard.

William flicked the ash from his cigarette, his deep eyes fixed on the horizon.

******

Saturday afternoon, sunlight filtered through thin clouds, gently illuminating the street.

Samuel's black Bentley slowly pulled up in front of Victoria's apartment building.

A moment later, Victoria stepped out, and it was as if the air around her brightened.

She wore a light blue off-shoulder gown that flowed gracefully to her ankles, perfectly accentuating her slender waist and elegant figure.

Her makeup was delicate and understated, her shiny hair loosely pinned up with a few strands falling around her long neck, adding a touch of casual allure. She looked like a fairy stepping out of a painting, breathtakingly beautiful.

Samuel got out of the car and quickly walked over to her, his eyes filled with admiration and tenderness.

He extended his hand, gently taking Victoria's arm. "You look stunning today."

Victoria blushed slightly and smiled. "You look handsome too."

Samuel was dressed in a tailored suit that highlighted his tall, lean frame, paired with a simple yet elegant white shirt. His hair was meticulously styled, and beneath his fringe, his deep eyes and high-bridged nose exuded a natural grace that was hard to ignore.

They headed straight to the hotel.

Tonight was Samuel's grandfather's 80th birthday, and the entire Brown family was present, along with many of Elmer's business associates.

Despite Victoria's attempts to keep a low profile, her status as Joshua's student and a gold medalist in an art competition had made her somewhat famous.

As soon as she arrived, a group of Brown family relatives surrounded her, scrutinizing her and bombarding her with questions.

After all, Samuel was the most outstanding and picky among the younger generation of the Brown family.

They had introduced countless girls to him, but he had never shown interest in any of them.

No one expected him to choose someone as young as Victoria as his girlfriend.

Victoria remained composed, polite, and smiling, neither ingratiating nor aloof.

However, some people just didn't know when to stop-like the plump woman sitting next to Primrose, who looked at Victoria with disdain and openly mocked her. "The Brown family has high standards for daughters-in-law. Does such an ordinary girl deserve Samuel?"

Her voice wasn't low, and nearby people turned to look.

Seeing the attention, she raised her voice even more. "This girl may look all sweet and innocent, but her private life is a mess. She broke up an engaged couple and got tangled up with Alton from the Bridges family, causing a huge scandal last year. His girlfriend ended up in jail and had to pay a ton of money. Now she's after Samuel."

"And that's not all. Her dad committed serious crimes and went to prison, leaving a mountain of debt. Like father, like daughter. With a dad like that, how good can she be?" she added.

Samuel's face darkened, and he strode over before Victoria could stop him.

"Samuel, I'm fine."

Samuel approached, causing the woman to flinch. 

"Samuel..."

"Aunt Juno, I know my girlfriend better than anyone! If anyone dares to spread rumors again, don't blame me for not considering family ties!" Samuel said coldly, his gaze icy as he looked at the middle-aged woman named Juno.

Juno stepped back, embarrassed and angry. "Samuel! How can you talk to me like that? I'm your aunt! You've been bewitched by this woman. You used to be so mature and sensible, but now you dare to defy your elders? Everyone can see that this girl is causing chaos even before she's married into the family. If she does, the Brown family will never have peace!"

She turned to Primrose, crying, "Primrose, look at your son! He's offending me for this woman. You need to set things right!"

Primrose's face was grim.

She had liked Victoria when they first met. Despite her modest background, Victoria was beautiful, well-mannered, and intelligent, with a pair of clear, innocent eyes.

Primrose had supported the relationship, but the more she learned, the more she worried about Victoria's complicated background.

She wasn't snobbish; she just feared that Samuel would face trouble if he married Victoria.

She sighed. "Samuel, how can you speak to Juno like that? She's your elder. Apologize to her!"

Samuel looked deeply at Primrose, understanding her underlying message.

Apologizing to Juno was just the surface; she also agreed with Juno's words.

He could hear it, and so could Victoria.

She lowered her eyes, her lips pressed into a thin line, saying nothing.

Samuel clenched his fists, turned, and took Victoria's hand, leading her away.

Primrose was stunned. "Samuel! Stop! Where are you taking her?"

Ignoring her, Samuel left the venue with Victoria.

He was usually polite and composed, but today he was uncharacteristically impulsive.

Elmer was in a private room with some business friends when Primrose came in. He greeted her and then stepped out.

"What happened?"

"It's Samuel..." She had barely explained when Elmer, furious, went to find Samuel. "This is outrageous! Does he know what today is? Causing a scene over a woman? He's embarrassing me!"

Apologizing to his friends, he stormed out, with Primrose following.

They found Samuel in the hotel lobby, kneeling to fix the folds in Victoria's dress, murmuring, "Wait here, I'll get the car."

Elmer was livid, and Primrose's heart ached.

"You idiot!"

###chapter 157 You Misunderstood

Elmer stormed up to Samuel, grabbing his collar and shoving him aside. Without even glancing at Victoria, who was sitting nearby, he pointed a finger at her and yelled, "Who the hell does she think she is? Is she worth you groveling like this? You're catering to a woman with such a complicated background?"

Elmer, usually a calm and composed man, was clearly beside himself with anger today, speaking without thinking.

Victoria felt a rush of blood to her head, a mix of grievance, defiance, and deep humiliation surging through her.

Samuel was furious too. "Dad! Watch your words!"

"Don't give me that! Have you never seen a woman before? Treating this troublemaker like she's some kind of treasure! Do you know what day it is? Bringing her here not only upset the elders but also brought shame on me!"

Victoria couldn't take it anymore. She bit her lip hard to keep from lashing out and turned to leave.

"Victoria!"

Samuel ignored Elmer and Primrose, rushing after her. "Victoria, don't go!"

"I'm sorry, Samuel. I didn't know it would be like this. If I had known, I wouldn't have come."

Elmer stood there, sneering. "You really shouldn't have come! Do you even know your place? Just because you've made a name for yourself in some gallery doesn't mean you can step into the Brown family! Let me tell you, I'd rather see my son single for life than let him marry you!"

"Dad!"

Samuel turned back, glaring at Elmer, but still lowered his voice, pleading, "I'm begging you, please stop."

Primrose tried to calm things down, "Elmer, just say a little less."

Victoria felt a deep ache in her heart. She had agreed to date Samuel to start a new life and leave her past behind, but it seemed like her past was always there, haunting her.

"Samuel, listen to your parents. You should go back." She tried to walk away, but Samuel held her hand tightly.

He had a feeling that if he let go, he would lose her forever.

Victoria looked down at his hand gripping hers. "Samuel, we..."

"Don't say it, Victoria, please don't." He held her hand even tighter, his eyes starting to redden.

At this moment, Primrose stepped forward and gently said, "Samuel, today is your grandfather's birthday. Don't argue with your father. How about this, I'll walk Ms. Carter out."

Samuel resisted, "If anyone's walking her out, it's me."

"Why are you being so stubborn today? It seems Juno was right..." Primrose didn't finish her sentence, but her gaze shifted to Victoria.

Victoria was silent for a moment, then softly said to Samuel, "Mrs. Brown is right. You should go back inside."

"But what about you?"

Knowing he was worried about her, Victoria leaned in and whispered, "You're only making this harder for me."

Samuel frowned, his lips dry, reluctantly letting go of her hand. "Text me when you get home."

"Okay."

Primrose led the way. "Ms. Carter, I'll walk you out."

Victoria waved to Samuel and followed Primrose.

She could tell Primrose had something to say and could guess what it was.

This was an issue she would have to face sooner or later; there was no point in avoiding it.

Once they reached the street, Primrose turned to Victoria with a look of regret. "Victoria, I actually like you. You're smart, talented, and beautiful. Anyone who marries you would be lucky. Unfortunately, Samuel isn't that lucky. He doesn't deserve you."

Even though she had expected this, Victoria still felt like a heavy stone was pressing on her chest, making it hard to breathe.

Being completely rejected like this made her feel like everything was her fault, like she was a total failure.

"We did support you and Samuel at first, but then we heard about your past with William. I'm sorry, Victoria, but the Brown family has strict values. We can't accept your past. You wouldn't want to see Samuel break away from us and still enjoy your relationship, would you?"

Even though Victoria was strong, being repeatedly reminded of her past wounds was hard to bear.

But this was Samuel's mother. Victoria didn't want to have a falling-out with her, especially since she owed Samuel so much.

So, despite feeling stiff and pale, she forced a smile.

Just as she was about to speak, a clear, deep voice interrupted, "Mrs. Brown, I think you misunderstand."

Victoria turned her head in surprise.

William was striding in from the gate.

He was dressed in a black tailored shirt and light gray trousers, looking straight and imposing, exuding an air of nobility and restraint.

She hadn't expected to see him here.

Seeing him brought back all the memories of what he had done to her.

Victoria's face went pale, her nails digging into her palms, the pain keeping her grounded.

Primrose looked at Victoria, then at William, clearly not expecting to see him here.

"William?" She forced a smile, "Are you here for my father-in-law's birthday party too?"

She remembered not sending him an invitation.

Although the Brown family and the Scott family had business dealings, they weren't close.

"He came with me," Eugene, who had been ignored for a while, chimed in. "William heard it was Mr. Brown's 80th birthday and wanted to come and congratulate him."

"Is that so? Thank you so much! William, please come in."

Primrose, all smiles, invited William to the hall.

But William didn't move. He glanced at Victoria, then looked back at Primrose, speaking coolly, "Mrs. Brown, I heard you say this Ms. Carter has some entanglement with me?"

Primrose was taken aback, then quickly explained, "It's nothing. Just that she used to..."

William cut her off coldly, "I think you misunderstand. Ms. Carter was my secretary for two years. The rumors out there are just baseless gossip. The Brown family is a respected family, surely you don't believe such unfounded stories, do you?"

Primrose's face turned sour, forcing a smile, "You're right, William. Our family values rules and etiquette. Those rumors are not to be believed. Ms. Carter, please don't take it to heart."

###chapter 158 Coffee

Victoria lowered her gaze, clutching the hem of her dress tightly.

She knew William was trying to help her.

But she didn't need it.

Taking a deep breath, she swallowed the bitterness rising in her throat, lifted her head, and forced a smile at Primrose. "Mrs. Brown, I know you mean well. You must be really busy today, so I won't keep you any longer. I'll be on my way now."

With that, Victoria picked up her dress and hurried away in her high heels.

She just wanted to get out of this suffocating place.

William watched her retreating figure, his lips pressed into a tight line.

******

Victoria wandered aimlessly down the street in her high heels.

Her phone suddenly rang from her bag, the sound grating on her nerves.

Without looking, she knew who was calling. She paused for a moment but didn't reach for the phone.

Her mind was a mess, and she had no idea what to say if she answered.

The phone rang persistently, but Victoria ignored it, walking in a daze, her eyes unfocused, oblivious to everything around her.

William sat in his car, his eyes following her petite figure through the window.

Harry drove slowly, quietly trailing behind Victoria.

Occasionally, there were honks from behind, but most people, seeing the expensive car, wisely chose to steer clear, not wanting any trouble.

"Mr. Scott, you didn't bring out this new car just to follow Ms. Carter, did you?" Harry asked tentatively.

William shot him a glance. "You're getting more talkative."

Harry pursed his lips, not daring to say more.

William's temper was getting worse; he couldn't even take a joke anymore.

Men who got dumped were always in a foul mood, it seemed.

Victoria wandered aimlessly until she found herself standing outside a mall.

The plaza outside the mall was bustling with people.

It was early spring, but the weather hadn't warmed up yet. The cold wind was biting, and people hurried along, bundled up in their coats.

The nearby coffee shop exuded a warm, inviting atmosphere. The glass door was fogged up, and the sweet aroma wafting out attracted a line of customers.

A couple stood at the entrance of the coffee shop.

The woman was slender and looked a bit worn out, wearing a thin, old coat with frayed cuffs. She rubbed her arms and softly said to the man beside her, "Honey, it's so cold. Can I get a cup of coffee to warm up?"

The man, tall and burly, looked impatient.

He frowned and gruffly replied, "Coffee? Five dollars for a drink? Let's go, stop dawdling and embarrassing us!"

The woman's eyes reddened instantly, tears welling up. Her long-suppressed grievances burst out, her voice trembling. "I work so hard every day, exhausted from my job, and then I come home to cook, clean, and take care of you and the kids. Now I just want a cup of coffee, and I can't even have that? Am I not a person?"

The crowd around them grew, and people began to cast reproachful glances at the man, whispering among themselves. "He's so stingy. It's freezing, and he won't even buy his wife a coffee. That's outrageous."

"Yeah, it's just five dollars."

The man, noticing the crowd's disapproving looks, felt embarrassed.

Furious, he threw his cigarette butt on the ground and stomped on it, then roughly grabbed the woman's wallet. "No coffee! Give it here!"

In the struggle, the woman's clothes became disheveled, and her hair fell loose, sticking to her tear-streaked face, making her look utterly miserable.

At that moment, a stylish handbag suddenly flew over, hitting the man's arm hard.

"Who did that?" The man glared around, veins bulging on his neck.

In the crowd, Victoria stood tall and graceful, her face beautiful, wearing a blue dress under her wool coat.

She stepped forward, picked up the handbag from the ground, dusted it off, and slung it over her shoulder. Then she walked to the woman's side and gently helped her up.

Looking at the man with disdain, she said slowly, "In your eyes, your wife, who shares your life, doesn't even deserve a five-dollar coffee?"

The woman trembled at these words, her despair deepening. Her lips quivered as she shouted at the man for the first time, "Divorce! I can't live like this anymore!"

The crowd chimed in, "Divorce him! A man who doesn't care for his wife isn't worth keeping!"

"Exactly, so selfish, can't even spend a little money on his wife."

The man, now enraged, directed his fury at Victoria. "You nosy woman! This is between me and my wife. Who asked for your opinion?"

He cursed and raised his hand to strike Victoria.

But before he could touch her, a dark figure blocked his way, and the next moment, the man was kicked to the ground, crying out in pain.

Victoria stared in surprise at William, who had stepped in front of her, stunned.

The man struggled to get up, pointing at William and cursing, "You bastard! How dare you hit me! I'll kill you!"

He swung his fist at William, but he was no match. William easily knocked him down again.

The man lay on the ground, groaning, spitting blood, and glaring at William.

William sneered, looking down at him. "What's wrong? Weren't you going to kill me? Go on, then!"

Victoria watched William fight, feeling no concern, only annoyance.

She walked into the coffee shop, bought a cup of coffee for the woman, and handed it to her.

The woman looked at the coffee, her eyes welling up with tears. "Thank you," she choked out.

William approached.

Harry would take care of the rest.

Victoria acted as if she didn't see him, walking past him.

As she took a step, William grabbed her arm, pulling her into a secluded corner.

Victoria struggled angrily, but she couldn't budge him.

"Mr. Scott, let go of me!"

"Did you sleep with Samuel?" William demanded through gritted teeth.

###chapter 159 Unless You Die

"Does it even matter to you?" Victoria shot him a glare, her teeth clenched.

William felt a sharp pang in his chest as she didn't deny it, his eyes instantly welling up.

It was like his heart was being sliced apart with a dull knife, the pain unbearable.

Victoria looked at him coldly, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "Didn't you always say I was a whore who'd sell herself for money? I'm just doing what you said. Why are you acting all hurt now? Isn't it ridiculous?"

William stared at her, feeling a deep, festering pain in the most hidden part of his heart.

He silently watched her.

She was clearly thinner than before, but her eyes were still clear and bright, filled with a stubbornness.

This was the girl he loved, and also the one he had hurt the most.

"Are you doing this to get back at me?" he murmured softly.

"Don't flatter yourself. Do you think I'd ruin myself for you? Samuel is a thousand times, no, ten thousand times better than you!" Victoria shot back mockingly.

William felt a mix of pain and bitterness in his heart. He clenched his fists, enduring the tearing pain inside, and asked again, "Victoria, I admit I started out to get back at your father, but later..."

"Shut up!" Victoria lost control, screaming to cut him off, her eyes cold and filled with hatred. "Haven't you bullied me enough? Why are you still bothering me?"

William fell silent immediately, staring at her in a daze. He opened his mouth, wanting to explain, but his throat was so dry he couldn't form a complete sentence.

What should he say? What could he say? Should he say he really loved her? He was afraid she would hate him even more.

After a long silence, he suddenly grabbed Victoria's shoulders tightly, almost begging, "What do I have to do for you to forgive me?"

Victoria winced in pain from his grip and desperately shook off William's hold. "William, I won't forgive you unless you die!"

With that, she turned and ran away, her eyes quickly filling with tears, but she didn't want them to fall.

William stood there in a daze, feeling as if his heart had been hollowed out, the emptiness suffocating him.

******

Victoria ran all the way home, only to find Nora squatting at the door, yelling at the house. "Victoria, I'm your mother! How dare you not let me in?"

"Victoria, are you getting too cocky? Do you think you can ignore me?"

"Get out here right now!"

"Victoria, if you don't come out, don't blame me for being rude!"

Her voice echoed through the neighborhood, and the neighbors peeked out, whispering among themselves.

Victoria walked up helplessly. "Mom, what are you doing?"

Nora stood up and slapped Victoria across the face, scolding, "How dare you ask me why? I've called you so many times, and you didn't answer once! Do you even see me as your mother?"

Victoria covered her swollen cheek, looking down. "Sorry, I didn't hear it."

Nora was about to continue scolding her, but Victoria had already taken out her keys and opened the door.

Nora didn't bother causing more trouble and immediately walked into the yard. As soon as she entered the house, she started shouting, "Where's your dad? What's he doing? He never answers my calls."

"He's out of the country," Victoria replied indifferently.

Nora's interest was piqued. "Out of the country? What's he doing, business?"

Although she had always disliked Alvin's gentle, unmanly demeanor, she had to admit he had a good business mind.

Starting from scratch, in just over a decade, he had turned a small design company into a top national enterprise. It was a miracle!

Victoria glanced at her. "How would I know what he's doing?"

Hearing this, Nora angrily twisted her ear, scolding, "You little brat, how dare you talk to me like that? Do you believe I'll beat you to death?"

Victoria winced in pain and pushed her away. "I warn you, if you touch me again, I'll have the property management kick you out. This house is mine now."

"You!" Nora pointed at her nose, her chest heaving with anger.

Though she was full of bluster, she didn't dare use violence again.

She knew that Victoria was indeed capable of doing it now.

Victoria pushed out a large suitcase and coldly said to Nora, "I've packed your clothes and other things. I'll call a car to take you to a hotel."

"I have a home. Why should I stay in a hotel?" Nora said nonchalantly, walking to the sofa and sitting down gracefully.

She patted the empty spot beside her, signaling Victoria to sit too. "Victoria, I know you have issues with me, but that's all in the past. Now that your dad is out of prison, our family can finally be together again. We should look forward, not dwell on the past."

Victoria emphasized each word, "This home is mine and Dad's!"

Nora laughed, a hint of smugness in her eyes. "Have you asked him? Did he say he doesn't want to get back together with me?"

Victoria was stunned. She hadn't actually asked Alvin about his thoughts.

Seeing her reaction, Nora became even more smug, shaking her head slightly. "It's all your assumption. How could you understand our feelings? Your dad and I have been on and off for years. This is just how we are. You have no right to decide for him."

Victoria's face turned cold, and she retorted mercilessly, "You abandoned him."

"But he doesn't care! Just wait until he comes back and ask him if he still has feelings for me. Without me, he can't live." Nora smiled, getting up to grab Victoria's hand. Victoria instinctively stepped back, her eyes full of unfamiliarity and wariness.

"Victoria, let me give you some advice. Your dad loves me very much. Don't let your selfishness keep us apart. You might face some bad karma." With that, Nora yawned, took her pajamas from the suitcase, and went to the bathroom to take a shower.

"Don't call me for dinner," Nora added.

Victoria stood there, feeling helpless and wronged.

After a while, she slowly walked to the sofa, took out her phone, and dialed Alvin's number.

The phone rang for a long time before it was answered. "Victoria."

The background noise on Alvin's end sounded very loud and chaotic; it seemed like he was in a place like a bar.

Victoria frowned and asked, "Dad, where are you now?"

Alvin's voice came nervously, "Victoria, I'm busy. You should go to bed early. I'll be back in a few days."

Victoria obediently agreed and was about to hang up when she suddenly heard Daisy's scream on the other end of the line.

###chapter 160 Missing

As soon as Alvin stepped into the bar in Xandria, he was hit by a mix of smoke, alcohol, spices, and stifling heat.

The bar was dimly lit, with flickering lights and music that had a strong exotic vibe. The heavy drumbeats seemed to sync with his heartbeat.

A few local businessmen walked ahead of him, their faces full of arrogance, heads held high. One of them said, "There are plenty of companies wanting to work with us. What makes you think we'd choose your small company?"

Alvin followed behind them, his brow furrowed, unwilling to give up. He pleaded, "Efren..."

"Enough, we'll talk about this later," the man called Efren said impatiently, waving his hand dismissively. His thick arm pushed Alvin aside with a rough shove.

The disdain on Efren's face was unmistakable, showing no respect as he turned and led his group towards a private room.

Alvin stood there alone, clutching the proposal he had poured his heart and soul into, his knuckles white from the pressure.

He slowly turned around, the weight of defeat heavy on his face.

As he looked up, he saw Daisy sitting by the bar not far away.

Daisy was wearing a tight, crimson dress that accentuated her curves.

Her makeup was meticulously done, exuding a cold, fierce beauty. In this exotic and alluring bar, she was like a blooming rose with thorns, radiating a dangerous yet captivating charm.

Daisy noticed him too, and didn't avoid his gaze. She watched him with a calm, detached look.

Just then, a tall man in a flashy shirt and a thick gold chain approached Daisy, speaking with a heavy accent, "Miss, are you alone?"

Daisy didn't respond immediately. She raised an elegant eyebrow and a faint smile played on her lips, like a lazy yet regal cat, making her even more enticing.

Before she could reply, the man was abruptly pulled aside. "She's not alone."

Daisy's smile deepened, her eyes still fixed on Alvin.

The man was about to protest, but seeing the burly bodyguards behind Daisy, he backed off and left dejectedly.

Alvin walked over and sat across from Daisy, casually picking up a drink and downing it. "What are you doing here?"

Daisy's slender fingers gently held her wine glass, swirling the red liquid inside.

She spoke softly, "Just relaxing, and maybe finding someone to spend the night with. You just scared off a decent prospect. How are you going to make it up to me?"

Alvin stared at her silently for a moment, then looked away, his voice tinged with weariness. "Xandria is too chaotic, full of all kinds of people. It's not safe for you. You should go back."

"If you can handle it, why can't I?" Daisy raised an eyebrow, a hint of defiance in her tone.

"I'm not like you," Alvin paused, then continued, "Here, they still have some fear of me."

"Perfect, with you as my 'guardian angel,' I have nothing to worry about," Daisy said, standing up and tossing her small purse to him. "I'm hungry. Take me to get something to eat."

Alvin frowned, looking troubled. "I still have business to discuss."

Daisy turned back, giving him a charming smile and a playful wink. "There are other ways to negotiate besides pestering. Come on."

******

Daisy and Alvin went missing in Xandria.

Victoria received the news while she was organizing art books in the gallery.

The shock nearly made her faint on the spot.

Thankfully, Wendy was there to catch her.

After taking leave, she was about to rush home to pack when she found William's car already parked outside.

Victoria, setting aside their past grievances, urgently asked, "What happened? Why did they suddenly disappear?"

William's lips were pressed into a thin line, his face icy. "I don't know the details, but according to Aunt Daisy's bodyguards, they went to meet someone in a private room at a bar and never came out."

Victoria's heart sank.

Seeing her pale face and red eyes, William's heart ached. He softly reassured her, "Don't worry. Aunt Daisy and Alvin will be fine. I'm heading to Xandria now to bring them back."

"I'm coming with you!" Victoria insisted.

"No way!" William refused without hesitation.

Xandria was a dangerous place, overrun by gangs. Human life there was worth nothing.

He couldn't let Victoria take that risk.

"William, please, let me go with you. I'm so scared. I'm worried something will happen to them. Please take me with you."

Seeing her pleading expression, William finally relented. "You can come, but you must stay within my sight."

Victoria nodded repeatedly.

William sighed, "Go pack. I'll arrange the tickets."

Nora was in the living room with a face mask on, a plate of fruit and a glass of fresh juice in front of her.

Her surgery had been postponed, and her health was still precarious. But she always took care of herself, and lately, she had been indulging in expensive supplements and imported fruits.

Seeing Victoria return, Nora quickly removed her mask and rushed over to block her path. "Why are you home early?"

Victoria, consumed with worry, had no time for her. She pushed past Nora and headed upstairs.

"I'm talking to you!" Nora, hands on her hips, glared after her, chest heaving with anger.

Soon, Victoria came back down.

"Stop right there!" Nora grabbed Victoria's arm, her face livid. "Is this how you treat me? Do you want me to expose your secrets?"

"Go ahead!"

Victoria shook her off angrily. "If you don't mind the shame, why should I? Expose away!"

Her shout stunned Nora, who stared at her in shock.

Nora noticed the items Victoria was packing.

She snatched them away. "What's this?"

"Give it back!" Victoria reached for it, but Nora had already stepped back onto the stairs. Seeing it was a passport, she looked suspicious. "What do you need this for?"

###chapter 161 Boarding

Victoria's eyes were sharp as she glared at Nora. "Hand it over!"

The more desperate Victoria got, the more suspicious Nora became. Her face showed increasing panic. "Are you planning to leave this family? Are you going to abandon me?"

Once this thought crossed her mind, Nora became frantic.

She knew how much Alvin adored Victoria. She had just managed to move back in, and if Victoria left, wouldn't Alvin leave too?

Suddenly, she turned and bolted for the door. "Without this, let's see where you can go!"

"Give it to me!" Victoria, both angry and anxious, hurried after her to snatch back the passport.

Nora, already frail, hadn't even reached the door before she clutched her chest, gasping for breath.

Seeing Victoria coming to grab it, she clung to the passport tightly. "No, I won't give it to you!"

Not only that, she pushed Victoria hard. "I'm telling you, no matter where you go, you can't shake me off!"

Victoria stumbled back a few steps and fell to the ground.

Suddenly, the door was kicked open!

William appeared in the doorway.

Seeing someone enter, Nora quickly scrambled up from the floor.

William, with a dark expression, strode towards her.

"Ah! You..." Nora, terrified of William, dropped the passport and ran to a corner, hiding behind the curtains, trembling.

William bent down, picked up the passport, dusted it off, and handed it to Victoria.

Victoria took it and stuffed it into her bag, quickly heading for the door. "Let's go!"

William said nothing, turned, and left.

It wasn't until she heard the car outside that Nora dared to come out.

She slowly walked to the door, suspiciously watching the direction they left.

Where were they going?

Leaving in such a hurry, and with passports?

Suddenly, Nora's eyes widened. Were they eloping?

******

The car sped down the road.

When they arrived at the airport, Harry was already there, handing William his passport and ticket. "Mr. Scott, everything is arranged."

"Good." William took them without looking and handed them to Victoria.

Victoria instinctively caught them and checked the ticket. It was for the next available flight.

He walked ahead, and Victoria quickly followed, asking Harry, "Why are there only two tickets? Aren't you coming?"

"I need to stay and handle some matters at the company. I'll join you later."

Victoria nodded slightly.

But she couldn't help feeling a bit uneasy. So, they would be spending all their time together?

Before boarding, Victoria went to a corner and called Wendy, giving her some work instructions.

Then she called Samuel.

"Xandria? That's too dangerous! I don't feel comfortable with you going alone! But I can't leave right now. Can you wait for a day? I'll go with you tomorrow."

"Samuel, I'm not going alone." Victoria hesitated but felt there was no need to hide it. "I'm going with William. His aunt and my father are involved."

She looked up, seeing William standing a respectful distance away, not too close to invade her privacy but not too far either.

Many people around were looking at him, and some girls were secretly taking pictures with their phones.

On the other end, Samuel was silent for a moment before saying, "I understand."

Victoria slowly turned around, holding her phone, and said softly, "Samuel, don't overthink it. We're just traveling together for the same purpose."

"Are you worried I'll be upset?"

"Yeah," Victoria admitted. "You're my boyfriend now. I have to consider your feelings in everything I do."

Samuel chuckled. "Don't worry about me. I won't overthink it. Just take care of yourself. Once I get permission from the school, I'll come find you."

"Okay."

In the bustling airport lounge, people hurried by.

Victoria stood by the large window, staring blankly at the planes taking off and landing, clutching her ticket so tightly her fingers turned white.

William watched her, frowning, wanting to say something but stopping himself. Finally, he just sighed softly.

The boarding announcement came over the speakers. Victoria took a deep breath and walked towards the gate, with William following closely behind.

They hadn't spoken much since the initial exchange, and the atmosphere was cold and distant.

In the first-class cabin, the spacious and comfortable environment and the attentive service did nothing to improve Victoria's mood.

When she saw the two adjacent seats, she stopped abruptly, not wanting to sit too close to William.

She bit her lip and decisively approached a busy flight attendant, softly asking, "Excuse me, could I change my seat?"

The flight attendant smiled professionally and quickly made the arrangements.

William watched her with a blank expression, his eyes darkening.

He looked at her profile for a long time before looking away and sitting in his seat.

Victoria sat in her new seat by the window, looking out at the blue sky. But her mind was filled with worry, fear, and anxiety, leaving no room to appreciate the view.

Alvin had just come back to her. What would she do if something happened to him?

The thought made her shiver, her head spinning as if the whole world was turning upside down.

She closed her eyes, forcing herself to calm down and not jump to conclusions.

But her red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands betrayed her true emotions.

William noticed every detail.

In that moment, he wanted to go over and hold her, to comfort her.

But she hated him so much now, she wouldn't accept his kindness.

William smiled bitterly and lowered his eyes.

After a while, there was movement in the seat next to Victoria.

She turned instinctively and saw a strikingly handsome man.

The man was tall and well-built, with sun-kissed skin exuding a wild charm, as if he carried the scent of sunshine and the wilderness.

His chiseled features looked like they had been meticulously sculpted, with sharp eyebrows, a high nose, and slightly upturned lips that hinted at a rebellious streak.

A silver earring in his left ear glinted coldly, and a faint scar on his brow added a touch of mystery and danger to his allure.

As soon as he sat down, his gaze fell on Victoria, a flash of admiration in his eyes.

Victoria, in a hurry, had only changed out of her work clothes into a beige dress that perfectly outlined her graceful curves.

Her smooth hair fell over her shoulders, and her clear skin, paired with her elegant attire, made her look even more delicate and radiant.

She was already beautiful, but with tears in her eyes, she looked even more pitiful and heart-wrenching.

The man raised an eyebrow, looking at her with interest, his deep voice resonating. "Miss, do you need any help?"

###chapter 162 Xandria

Victoria heard the question, lifted her gaze, and paused for a moment before slowly shaking her head.

The man, undeterred, continued with a friendly smile, "You heading to Xandria alone?"

Seeing her tear-streaked face, he wondered if she had just broken up with her boyfriend and was traveling to heal her broken heart.

Victoria shook her head lightly, her tone distant and detached, "No, I'm here on business."

She had no interest in chatting with a stranger; her only focus was to get to Xandria quickly and find the missing Daisy and Alvin.

The man noticed her cold demeanor but wasn't offended. He continued to smile warmly, "Xandria can be a bit unstable. I'm Louie Hopper, kind of known around here. When we're away from home, we're all friends. If you need any help, just ask. It's fate that we're sitting together."

As he spoke, he extended his hand, seemingly wanting to shake hands with Victoria.

Victoria's internal alarm bells rang. She subtly pulled her hand back, just about to refuse when William appeared beside her.

He crouched down in front of Victoria, looking into her eyes with a mock scolding tone, "How long are you gonna stay mad? Come on, don't be like this."

His tone was like that of a boyfriend trying to make up after a small argument, affectionate yet slightly helpless.

Victoria was about to retort, but when she met William's slightly warning gaze, the words caught in her throat.

Louie observed the interaction with a faint smile, then casually played with his phone on the table.

William wrapped his arm around Victoria's waist, gently coaxing, "Okay, I was wrong. When we land, I'll buy you a gift to make up for it, alright?"

Louie watched them with a dark, unreadable expression for a few seconds before returning to his lazy demeanor.

Victoria responded stiffly, then turned away, ignoring him.

William didn't get angry and smoothly returned to his seat.

The plane flew steadily through the clouds. Victoria sat by the window, her gaze lost in the distance, her thoughts far away.

Suddenly, the plane jolted violently without warning. Trays, magazines, and other items scattered, and passengers screamed in panic.

Victoria was thrown forward, but Louie quickly grabbed her, preventing her from hitting the seat in front.

She gasped for breath and thanked him gratefully.

William frowned, glancing over but said nothing.

Victoria took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.

Louie, sitting next to her, looked surprised.

This seemingly delicate girl had quite the courage!

Soon, the turbulence subsided, and the plane gradually stabilized.

After a long flight, the plane finally landed at Xandria's airport.

As the cabin door opened, a wave of humid heat greeted them.

Victoria stood up, straightened her slightly disheveled clothes, and prepared to disembark.

Louie also stood up, taking out his phone and smiling at Victoria, "Miss, can I get your contact info? If you run into any trouble in Xandria, feel free to reach out."

William pulled Victoria into his arms, protectively holding her.

He glared at Louie with a cold expression, "Hitting on someone else's girlfriend isn't very polite, is it?"

Louie shrugged, "Just making friends, no need to be so tense."

William was about to say more, but Victoria tugged at him, politely declining, "Thanks for the offer, but I'll manage on my own."

She didn't want to get involved with strangers in this unfamiliar and complex place.

Louie wasn't offended. He shrugged and smiled even brighter, "Alright, see you around."

With that, he turned and blended into the crowd.

Victoria and William dragged their luggage out of the airport.

A black luxury car was already waiting outside. The driver saw them and immediately approached, respectfully taking their luggage and opening the car door, "Mr. Scott, Ms. Carter, welcome."

Victoria was surprised to learn that the Scott family had a branch here, their influence far greater than she had imagined.

Once in the car, it smoothly headed towards their destination.

Through the window, Victoria saw the unfamiliar yet exotic scenery, her emotions mixed.

They remained silent until the car stopped in front of a well-known local resort.

William led Victoria into the resort, where the rich Xandria ambiance hit them instantly.

The lobby's high ceiling, with its intricate wooden beams and hanging wicker lamps, cast a warm, soft glow on the polished teak floor, creating a play of light and shadow.

William walked confidently to the front desk, conversed with the staff, and soon received a room key.

Victoria noticed he had only booked one room and frowned, about to protest.

William, anticipating her reaction, quickly stepped forward and gently pulled her into his arms.

Victoria instinctively struggled but stopped when he whispered in her ear, his warm breath tickling her, "Not here. We'll talk in the room."

Reluctantly, she stayed quiet, letting William hold her as they entered the elevator.

The elevator stopped on the eighth floor with a soft ding, and the doors opened.

William carried Victoria straight into the room.

The spacious presidential suite was a blend of luxury and local charm.

A vibrant handwoven rug covered the floor, soft to the touch. In the center stood a large carved teak bed, draped with airy, flowing curtains.

There was also a large indoor hot spring bath, its edges inlaid with colorful glass tiles, steam rising invitingly.

A set of exquisite pewter tea ware and a plate of fresh, sliced fruit sat on the coffee table.

As soon as they entered, Victoria pushed William away, her eyes cold, "Why only one room?"

He raised an eyebrow, nonchalantly asking, "What, afraid I'll eat you up?"

Victoria gritted her teeth, "Regardless, I have a boyfriend. It's inappropriate for us to stay together."

William felt a pang in his heart but quickly composed himself.

He didn't respond, instead taking a small, sophisticated device from his luggage and began scanning the room.

Victoria sat silently, watching his actions.

Soon, the device emitted a few soft beeps, and William's expression darkened.

He pointed to a potted plant in the corner, the TV frame, and the lampshade by the bed, speaking quietly to Victoria, "Look, here, and here, there are hidden cameras."

###chapter 163 How Much for a Night?

Victoria followed the direction of his finger, and a shiver ran down her spine as fear washed over her.

William walked over, his expression softening a bit, and his tone gentler. "Xandria's got its dangers, and we don't have many options right now. For the next few days, we'll have to make do. You can take the bed, and I'll crash on the couch, okay?"

Victoria pressed her lips together and stayed silent for a moment.

Finally, she nodded, agreeing to his plan.

Seeing her willingness to cooperate, William let out a sigh of relief.

He walked over to the balcony and checked his watch. "Get some rest. I'm heading out to look for clues about Aunt Daisy and your dad. If you get too restless, you can walk around the resort, but don't wander too far."

As he spoke, he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket with a phone number written on it and handed it to Victoria. "This is Quinton's number. He's the driver waiting outside the resort. If anything happens, call him right away."

Victoria hesitated for a moment before nodding lightly.

William looked at her still distant and cold expression, feeling a slight pang in his heart.

He turned to leave, but Victoria suddenly called out to him, her voice still icy but with a hint of concern if one listened closely. "Be careful."

William froze at her words.

With his back to Victoria, his eyes were deep and unreadable, but a faint smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

He turned to look at her, his gaze filled with unspoken words, but he only said softly, "Wait for me to come back."

Victoria nodded, saying nothing more.

After William left, the room fell into a heavy silence.

Alone in the room, every minute felt like an eternity, and the quiet made her increasingly anxious and restless.

Two hours later, unable to sit still any longer, she decided to take a walk around the resort to clear her mind.

The resort's wooden walkways twisted and turned, tall palm trees swayed in the breeze, and their large leaves rustled softly.

Not far away, the surface of the outdoor pool shimmered, with a few wicker lounge chairs scattered around, colorful cushions casually tossed on them, exuding a lazy, relaxed vibe.

However, Victoria was too anxious to appreciate the beautiful scenery.

She wanted to call William to ask if there was any news, but she was afraid of disturbing him.

She sighed and decided to head back to her room to wait.

In the distance, she noticed a small figure.

It was a cute girl who looked about seventeen or eighteen, struggling to push a large basket of fruit. The basket was clearly too heavy for her, and as she stumbled, the fruit spilled everywhere.

Seeing this, Victoria felt a pang of sympathy.

She hesitated for a moment before walking over to help pick up the fruit.

The girl looked up at her, her bright eyes blinking, and smiled. "Thanks! Are you from Crystalia?"

Victoria nodded lightly. "Yeah."

The girl's eyes lit up instantly, and she beamed. "I'm Giselle Hopper, I work here. What's your name?"

Victoria smiled. "I'm Victoria."

Giselle nodded enthusiastically. "Nice to meet you, Victoria! I'm taking these fruits to the kitchen. Enjoy your time here!"

"Okay." Victoria nodded, watching Giselle leave.

After parting ways with Giselle, Victoria walked back the way she came.

Suddenly, two young men with tattoos blocked her path.

One of them, a red-haired guy named Jett, leered at her chest and grinned. "Hey, miss, how much for a night?"

Did he think she was a prostitute?

Victoria glared at Jett in disgust, said nothing, and tried to walk past them.

The other guy, with a buzz cut, named Hayden, blocked her way, his beady eyes fixed on her legs. "Hey, miss, you're from Crystalia, right? So am I. How about a drink? I promise you'll have a great time."

Victoria was both shocked and furious, her cheeks flushing red. She clenched her fists and shouted, "Get lost!"

"Feisty, huh?" Hayden rubbed his hands together, a sleazy smile on his face. "I like feisty women. They're wild!" He reached out to grab her chest.

Victoria stepped back quickly, avoiding his hand.

Seeing this, Hayden got even more excited. "You dare to resist? Do you know who I am? I'm with The Raven Syndicate. Piss me off, and I'll kill you."

He laughed lewdly. "Tonight, I'll show you what a real man is."

Enraged, Victoria slapped him hard across the face.

The sharp sound of the slap echoed, and everything went silent.

Hayden clutched his swollen cheek, stunned for a moment, then flew into a rage. He grabbed Victoria by the collar and lifted her up, cursing. "You bitch! Don't you know what's good for you? I'll rape you right now!"

Victoria struggled, her head spinning and her breath coming in gasps.

Hayden's grip was too strong, and she couldn't break free.

Just as she felt she was about to suffocate, a strong hand suddenly grabbed Hayden's wrist and pried it open.

In the next moment, William yanked Hayden's hand off Victoria and kicked him hard.

Hayden screamed and fell to the ground like a broken kite.

Jett, seeing this, tried to fight back, but William dodged his punch and delivered a sharp elbow to his face, sending Jett to the ground, clutching his nose in pain.

William glared at them coldly. "Keep your hands to yourselves, or I'll break them."

Jett groaned in pain, then got up, gritting his teeth. "Fine! You're tough! Just you wait!"

With that, he turned and ran.

William quickly moved to Victoria's side, shielding her behind him, his voice trembling with anger. "Are you okay?"

Victoria, still shaken, shook her head, her eyes filled with fear and relief.

"Let's go back." William held her hand tightly.

Victoria hesitated, glancing in the direction the men had fled. "They won't come back, will they?"

William patted her shoulder reassuringly. "Don't worry. I'll handle it."

Victoria bit her lip and whispered, "Thank you."

William led her back to the room.

Once inside, he went straight to the bathroom, cleaned up, and changed his clothes before coming out.

Victoria stood by the window, watching him intently.

Despite her lingering resentment and anger towards him, she felt an unexpected sense of security and calm when she looked at him.

When he emerged, Victoria couldn't contain her anxiety any longer. She stepped forward and asked, "Did you find any clues while you were out?"

William looked at her, his expression serious. "I found some information. My aunt and your father were caught in a gang fight while negotiating a deal. Your father fought to protect my aunt and injured some people. Those people belong to the biggest gang in Xandria. They were captured."

###chapter 164 Be Careful

Hearing this, Victoria's mind raced with anxiety.

The Xandria mob-those guys were ruthless, cold-blooded killers!

Victoria instinctively grabbed William's arm. "What do we do? Do they want money? I can sell my villa right now if it helps."

She was so terrified that she could barely form a coherent sentence.

William frowned, holding her hand in return. "Don't panic. This started because of my aunt. If it's just money they want, I'll pay whatever it takes. I've already sent someone to negotiate with their leader. We should have news by tomorrow."

Victoria exhaled deeply, trying to control her emotions and stopped asking questions.

When she finally calmed down, she noticed that William was still holding her hand. His palm was warm and dry.

She quickly pulled her hand back, her face pale. "Thanks for helping with my dad."

William looked at her for a moment, then composed himself and said calmly, "You're welcome. You must be hungry. Let me take you to get something to eat."

Victoria wanted to refuse but knew that if she didn't eat properly, she wouldn't be able to help rescue Alvin and might even become a burden to William.

She pressed her lips together and nodded in agreement.

Nightfall in Xandria always came suddenly. Just after six, the sky was already enveloped in thick darkness.

William and Victoria went to a nearby restaurant.

They had just sat down when William's phone rang. He glanced at the screen and stood up. "You go ahead and order. I need to take this call."

"Okay," Victoria replied softly.

Through the window, Victoria could see William standing under a streetlamp, talking on the phone.

The dim light stretched his figure, and he occasionally rubbed his forehead, clearly troubled by the conversation.

The streets of Xandria were bustling with activity, filled with people from all walks of life.

Street vendors in traditional attire loudly hawked various snacks and handmade goods, while many foreign tourists, with large backpacks, excitedly took photos.

William stood tall and handsome under the streetlamp, drawing the attention of many passersby, both women and men.

Seeing William's impatient responses, Victoria momentarily forgot their past grievances and her current worries, a slight smile tugging at her lips.

William turned and caught sight of her smile, a softness appearing in his eyes.

It had been a long time since he had seen her smile.

Victoria noticed his gaze, and her smile froze. She quickly looked away, avoiding his eyes.

William felt a dull ache in his chest. He looked away and walked back into the restaurant.

Just then, a man approached Victoria with a fawning smile. "Miss, are you here for sightseeing too?"

"I am..." Victoria began to explain.

The restaurant door swung open, and William strode in.

He stepped in front of Victoria, giving the man a cold look. "Is there a problem?"

"No, no problem. Sorry to bother you." The man quickly realized William was not to be trifled with and scurried away.

William sat down, picking up his utensils, and said seriously to Victoria, "Xandria is a chaotic place. Be very careful when strangers approach you."

He looked at her intently. "Here, some people might be after more than just your money or your pretty face. They might want..."

He paused, lowering his voice, "your organs."

Victoria felt a chill run down her spine, fear gripping her.

Before coming to Xandria, she had heard about the dangers, but experiencing it firsthand was far more terrifying than she had imagined.

Seeing her fear, William's tone softened slightly. "Don't worry. As long as I'm here, I won't let anyone hurt you."

Victoria looked up at William and nodded silently.

The food arrived, filling the table with local dishes.

But Victoria had no appetite. She tried a few bites, but the strong spices and unfamiliar flavors were hard to swallow.

Seeing this, William frowned and, without a word, got up and headed to the kitchen.

A short while later, he returned with a steaming bowl of spaghetti.

Victoria stared at the spaghetti in surprise, then looked at William suspiciously. "Do they serve this here?"

William, hiding his slightly burned hands behind his back, said calmly, "I asked the chef to make it. It looks pretty good."

Victoria blinked, then hesitantly took a bite.

The rich tomato flavor filled her mouth, the pasta was tender and smooth, and the delicious taste spread across her tongue. She couldn't help but take another bite.

William watched her eat with satisfaction, a small smile playing on his lips.

After dinner, they returned to their room.

As soon as they entered, Victoria's phone rang. She saw it was Samuel.

William noticed too, his expression darkening instantly.

That Samuel, always lurking around.

He stood aside, arms crossed, watching Victoria intently.

Victoria walked to the window, turning slightly to avoid William's gaze, and answered the call.

Before she could speak, Samuel's gentle, concerned voice came through. "Victoria, how are you? Are you okay?"

Hearing his familiar, warm voice, Victoria's facade of strength crumbled, her eyes reddening. It took her a moment to choke out, "I'm fine."

Samuel sensed something was wrong and quickly asked, "Victoria, are you crying?"

Hearing Samuel's voice, Victoria's nose tingled with emotion.

She tried to control her feelings, sniffing. "No, I'm just a bit tired."

Samuel comforted her softly, "Don't be scared. I'll fly over in a few days to be with you. Which city are you in?"

Victoria hesitated, not wanting to involve Samuel. "No need, Samuel. Really, don't trouble yourself. We have a lead, and we should be able to return in a few days. Don't worry."

Samuel understood she didn't want him to come and sighed, giving in. "Alright, but take care of yourself. Call me if you need anything, okay?"

"Okay, don't worry." Victoria hung up and was about to wipe her tears.

Before she could react, a strong hand grabbed her neck, pressing her against the wall.

Victoria's eyes widened in shock, seeing William's jealous face inches from hers.

"William, what are you doing?" Victoria struggled in fear.

William ignored her, leaning in and kissing her fiercely.

###chapter 165 A Liar

Victoria's eyes widened in panic as she desperately tried to fend off William's aggressive advances. How could she possibly match his brute strength? The more she resisted, the more forceful he became.

Maybe it was because it had been so long since he had been close to her, but William's kiss was wild and rough, like he was venting some deep-seated frustration.

Victoria had no choice but to endure, pounding on his chest with all her might, but he remained unmoved.

It wasn't until she gradually lost the strength to fight back that he finally let her go.

Looking at Victoria's tear-streaked face and labored breathing, William's voice was low and hoarse, tinged with a barely perceptible hint of grievance. "Don't you dare cry for another man. Here, I'm the one you should rely on."

A sudden slap landed on his face, catching him off guard. Victoria bit her lip hard, glaring at William with hatred.

William clutched his burning left cheek, staring at her in stunned silence for a long moment.

"Get out!" Victoria pointed to the door, her voice a furious roar. "Get out of here! Now! Immediately!"

Her emotions were spiraling out of control, her eyes red and brimming with tears.

She despised him.

She didn't want to see him.

"William, you're nothing but a complete liar!" Victoria screamed hysterically. "You deceived me from the start. You got my father thrown in jail, then came back with money to humiliate me! You treated me like a clown for your amusement. Is that fun for you?"

Each of Victoria's accusations was like a needle, stabbing into William's heart.

He looked at her, his heart aching. "Victoria, I don't expect you to forgive me, but I truly care about you. Please, believe me."

As he spoke, he reached out to grasp her slender arm, trying to close the distance between them.

Victoria angrily shook off his touch, glaring at him with fury. "You care about me? What do you care about? That I'm young, that I'm naive, easy to mess with?"

William opened his mouth, but he didn't know how to explain.

Should he tell her he admired her kindness and simplicity, her strength and courage, her ability to stay optimistic despite her scars, her independence, and her clear sense of right and wrong?

No matter what he said now, she wouldn't believe a word.

Seeing his silence, Victoria's anger flared even more, and she spoke without thinking. "William, I'm starting to think my dad and your aunt's disappearance was just another one of your tricks to mess with me. You can't stand to see me happy, can you? You have to ruin my life to feel satisfied, don't you?"

William hadn't expected her to doubt him so deeply. Her hurtful words completely enraged him.

His eyes turned cold and resolute, a self-mocking smile playing on his lips. "If you think I'm that despicable, then I'll show you just how despicable I can be. After all, if you'll spread your legs for him, what's one more time with me?"

Victoria's body went rigid, her eyes wide with disbelief.

She never imagined William would say something so vile.

Before she could recover from the shock, William scooped her up and carried her to the hot spring pool in the suite, unceremoniously tossing her in.

Water splashed everywhere as Victoria fell in, her clothes soaking through instantly.

William looked down at her with a sneer, his voice dripping with cruelty. "You called me despicable, so I'll show you despicable."

Without waiting for her consent, he stepped into the pool, pinning Victoria against the wall.

The warm water enveloped most of their bodies. Victoria trembled all over, her hatred for him growing stronger, but she couldn't break free from his grip.

William held her arms, pinning her hands above her head, then lowered his head to lick her flushed earlobe.

Victoria struggled violently, twisting her waist, trying to push him away.

"William, you bastard! Let me go!"

William ignored her, his breath hot against her neck, sending shivers down her spine. Victoria couldn't help but tremble.

William's lips trailed down her body, his movements gentle and slow, as if handling a rare treasure.

Victoria's mind went blank for a second, then she fought back with all her might, but it was futile.

William's large hand slipped under her clothes, caressing her soft skin.

Victoria glared at him with wide eyes, filled with disgust.

Her look of hatred only spurred William on, his hand squeezing her breast harder.

"It hurts, let me go!" Victoria groaned in pain, her eyes quickly filling with tears.

"Let me go, William, let me go! It hurts!"

Tears streamed down her face as she curled up, trying to escape his hold.

"Good, it should hurt." William whispered in her ear, his voice filled with anguish. "Do you know how much it hurt me to find out you slept with Samuel? I wanted to kill him, then myself."

Victoria instinctively wanted to deny it. "I didn't..."

But she stopped herself. Why should she explain anything to him?

She wanted him to suffer as much as possible.

Victoria clamped her mouth shut, refusing to say another word, glaring at him with hatred.

Her defiance only fueled William's anger.

He roughly kissed her swollen lips, biting down hard.

Victoria's body instinctively recoiled, trying to get away from him.

Seeing her continued resistance, William grabbed a piece of fabric from the poolside, tearing off a strip to bind her hands.

"What are you doing?" Victoria's eyes widened in panic. She never expected William to tie her up.

Ignoring her cries, William pressed her against the edge of the pool.

He kissed her collarbone, his hand moving to her long, slender legs, his fingers slipping under her skirt, teasing her through her lace panties.

Victoria's body trembled uncontrollably, the water rippling around them.

Her body heated up under William's skilled touch, her cheeks flushing, her eyes glazing over, a warm sensation spreading from between her legs.

Her reaction excited William, who lowered his head to lightly suck on her red lips.

His fingers pressed and rubbed her sensitive spot.

Victoria bit her lip in shame, her eyes misting over, her body shaking even more.

Her legs involuntarily wrapped around William's narrow waist.

Noticing her response, William felt a surge of pleasure. He looked into her eyes, his gaze wild and seductive. "Enjoying it, aren't you?"

"No, please, don't." Victoria's voice was broken with sobs.

"I won't stop." William said, lifting her hips to place her on his lap.

Victoria could feel William's arousal pressing against her, ready to invade her most private place.

###chapter 166 You Lunatic

She was terrified, struggling to break free. "William, stop! I have a boyfriend. You can't do this."

William's face went pale at her words, and he lost all patience for foreplay.

He ripped off her underwear and forced himself into her.

The sudden pain made Victoria scream, her body shaking uncontrollably. "William, what are you doing? Let me go! I hate you!"

Her sobs only seemed to fuel William's aggression.

Each thrust brought tears to Victoria's eyes.

Amidst the pain, a pleasant sensation began to creep in.

"William! Stop, it hurts! William, you maniac, help! Help!"

Her cries were silenced by his kiss.

William pushed deeper, feeling her body tense around him, his eyes darkening.

One of his large hands gripped her breast, while the other slid down to grip her hips.

Victoria was on the verge of collapse, tears streaming down her face.

He forced her to arch her body to meet his movements.

Victoria was on the brink of fainting, yet she couldn't control the waves of sensation overtaking her.

Her body, sensitive to this unfamiliar yet familiar feeling, clung helplessly to William's shoulders, sobbing.

"Victoria, tell me, who's better, me or Samuel?"

Her body convulsed uncontrollably, but she bit her lip hard, shaking her head in despair, tears falling.

"I want you to admit you love me, Victoria. You love me." William's voice was hoarse, like a broken string.

Sweat covered his forehead, his handsome face flushed, his eyes clouded with madness.

At the same time, he thrust deeply into her.

The blend of extreme gentleness and brutality was seamless.

Victoria screamed, her body jerking, her fluids gushing onto William's deeply embedded member.

Her body went limp, her muscles tightening around him.

He sighed deeply, pulling back and thrusting again, the pleasure overwhelming Victoria to the point of dizziness.

Fluids splashed, passion soared, and in his fervor, William bit down on Victoria's collarbone, grinding with his molars, nearly drawing blood.

When William finally finished, Victoria lay trembling by the edge of the tub, still dazed from the one-sided, frenzied encounter.

She felt utterly drained, her body floating, barely clinging to consciousness.

William finally released her, carrying her limp form out of the hot spring.

He laid her on the bed, whispering in her ear, "You said I wasn't good enough. Tonight, I'll prove I'm a hundred times better than Samuel."

Victoria's pupils contracted. She opened her mouth, but before she could speak, William's body covered hers again.

"Victoria, from now on, no one else can touch you. Got it? Or I'll kill you." With that, he entered her again without waiting for a response.

That night, Victoria was repeatedly brought to the brink of unconsciousness and back, caught in a cycle of intense pain and pleasure.

The next morning, sunlight streamed into the room. Victoria struggled to open her eyes, her body aching as if she'd been hit by a truck.

"Awake?" William sat at the edge of the bed, his chiseled features shrouded in shadow.

Victoria frowned, uneasily shifting her body.

"Hurts?" William's tone was indifferent, almost emotionless.

"Get out!" Victoria was furious, wishing she could stab him.

"I remember you crying quite passionately last night." His casual tone hit a nerve, making Victoria even more agitated.

She gritted her teeth in hatred. "William! You're not even human!"

William didn't mind her insults, chuckling softly. "Of course I'm not. I'm a madman, a beast, a bastard."

Victoria was stunned. Was he giving up on himself?

William patted her cheek, his voice cold. "No matter what I am, you're mine unless I die."

With that, he got up and began dressing leisurely.

His body was impressive, muscular and toned, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist.

Every inch of his physique exuded a deadly allure.

Victoria stared at him, unable to look away.

Fully dressed, William approached her, looking down. He reached to touch her face, but she instinctively recoiled.

His hand paused mid-air before he nonchalantly withdrew it. "Stay in the room today. I'll find your father."

Victoria's body retreated, avoiding his touch. William's hand fell back, and he inserted it into his pocket.

"Don't wander off. If you're hungry, call room service." He warned her before leaving the bedroom.

As soon as the door closed, Victoria collapsed on the bed, her eyes vacant, tears slipping down her cheeks.

Exhausted, she locked the safety chain and fell into a deep sleep.

She didn't know how long she slept, but a faint noise broke the silence.

At first, it was barely noticeable.

Then, a sharp sound shattered the quiet-a key card unlocking the door.

In her sleep, Victoria vaguely heard the noise, thinking William had returned.

She forced herself awake, rubbing her eyes, ready to get up.

But as she was about to get out of bed, the door was violently slammed, shaking the frame as if someone outside was desperate to get in.

###chapter 167 Giselle

Victoria jolted awake, her drowsiness vanishing in an instant.

Her heart pounded, a primal fear gripping her. It couldn't be William. If he were back, he'd know she locks the door when she sleeps and would call first.

The room fell into an eerie silence. The door that had been hit stood still, with no further noise.

Victoria barely dared to breathe. She sat on the bed, staring at the door, her hands clutching the blanket so tightly her knuckles turned white.

After what felt like an eternity, with no more sounds outside, Victoria cautiously moved her feet, silently approaching the door.

She reached out with a trembling hand, slowly bringing her eye close to the peephole to see what was happening.

The hallway outside was dimly lit and empty, eerily quiet.

Just as she was about to breathe a sigh of relief, a bloodshot, menacing eye suddenly appeared on the other side of the peephole, as if it had been lurking in the darkness, waiting for her to look.

Victoria screamed in terror, instinctively stumbling back several steps, nearly tripping in her panic.

She covered her mouth with her hand, trying to stifle any more sounds, but her heart pounded loudly in her chest, impossible to calm.

Cold sweat poured from her forehead and back, soaking her clothes, and her body trembled uncontrollably.

A loud banging came from the door.

Victoria pressed herself against the wall, trying to control her shaking and stay calm.

Suddenly, she thought of calling the front desk. She fumbled for her phone on the nightstand, her fingers quickly dialing the number.

When the call connected, she tried to keep her voice steady, stammering, "Hello, this is Room 805. There's a man banging on my door. Please send someone to help me immediately."

The person outside must have heard her making the call, as the banging abruptly stopped, followed by a string of vile curses: "You bitch, calling for help? Just wait, I'll deal with you later!"

He kicked the door hard and then walked away.

Not long after, there was another knock at the door.

Victoria cautiously approached the peephole again and saw the little girl she had met yesterday, Giselle, along with two burly security guards.

She quickly opened the door. Giselle immediately noticed Victoria's fear and unease, stepping forward to hold her hand and softly reassure her, "Victoria, don't be scared. It's okay now."

Giselle's eyes were full of concern and sympathy, her small hand conveying a warm strength that helped calm Victoria's frantic heart.

Then, Giselle looked at Victoria with some anxiety and said, "Victoria, please don't call the police, okay? This resort belongs to my brother. We'll take full responsibility for what happened. We'll check the surveillance right away and make sure you get an explanation."

Her eyes were sincere and urgent, clearly afraid that Victoria might impulsively involve the police, causing an international incident and damaging the resort's reputation.

Victoria looked at the young but earnest Giselle in front of her, hesitated for a moment, and finally nodded.

She knew that in this unfamiliar place, having a friend was better than making an enemy, and Giselle seemed genuinely willing to help.

Seeing Victoria agree, Giselle smiled with relief, quickly giving instructions to the security guards before they hurried to the surveillance room.

But when Giselle and the guards anxiously pulled up the surveillance footage, it made everyone frown.

During the time the suspicious man appeared, the footage first shook violently.

Then, a hand holding a baseball cap reached out, precisely covering the hallway camera, plunging the screen into darkness.

Giselle's face turned pale, and Victoria immediately realized that such a skilled and targeted action was likely done by someone from the resort.

Her mind flashed to the two men who had troubled her yesterday. They had bad intentions then, and now, with William away, they had come again. The suspicion was too strong.

"Victoria, I'm so sorry. This is our fault. Our security wasn't up to par."

Giselle's eyes reddened with tears, her voice trembling, "I'll find out what happened as soon as possible and give you an explanation! Please don't call the police. If this turns into an international incident, our resort's business will be ruined. Victoria, how about this: no matter how long you stay here, I'll waive your room fee as an apology."

Victoria weighed her options. She understood that in a foreign country, the fewer complications, the better, and Giselle seemed genuinely kind.

After a moment of thought, she nodded slightly.

Victoria slowly climbed the stairs, heading back to her room.

As she reached the corner, she saw Jett and Hayden from yesterday.

Her alarm bells went off, and she instinctively slowed her pace, watching them warily, pressing herself against the side of the stairs to stay as far from them as possible.

Jett, with a cigarette dangling from his mouth, swaggered along. Seeing Victoria, he smirked maliciously.

He deliberately swung his shoulder, bumping into her, muttering, "What a coincidence. Sorry, didn't see you, slipped."

Victoria couldn't dodge in time, stumbling and hitting the wall hard.

A local wooden carving hung on the wall, its sharp edges scratching her arm. The pain was sharp, but the cut wasn't deep, and there was no blood.

"Such delicate skin, looks so fragile," Jett's eyes roamed over Victoria like a predator, his gaze making her feel like he wanted to devour her.

Victoria looked into his eyes, a chill running from her feet to her head, her mind flashing back to the bloodshot, menacing eye at the peephole.

"Hurry up!" Hayden, ahead, turned back impatiently, glaring at Jett before forcing a fake smile at Victoria, "Miss, don't be scared. With your boyfriend so fierce, we wouldn't dare bother you now."

After they swaggered down the stairs, Giselle appeared out of nowhere, angrily blocking Jett, demanding, "Jett, was that your doing just now?"

###chapter 168 Are You Okay

Victoria returned to her room, nervously locking the door and adding an extra bolt for good measure.

She kept glancing at the time on her phone. William had been gone for most of the day with no word.

Despite her intense dislike for him now, she still didn't want anything bad to happen to him.

The thought made her even more anxious.

Clutching her phone tightly, she bit her lip and hesitated for a long time before finally dialing William's number.

But the phone rang for a long time without anyone answering.

Victoria's heart leapt into her throat, and a wave of worry and fear washed over her. She couldn't help but dial William's number again, but once more, there was no answer.

In that moment, Victoria's mind buzzed with panic.

William, please don't let anything have happened to you.

Panic quickly spread through her body. Her fingers fumbled over the phone screen as she sent William a message: [Are you okay?]

After she sent the message, her eyes stayed glued to the screen, afraid to miss his reply.

And then began the long wait.

Victoria paced back and forth in the room, anxiety gnawing at her.

Outside, the sun blazed brightly, casting a vibrant glow over the tropical greenery of the resort, full of life and energy.

But inside, she felt like she was in an icebox, the cold seeping into her bones.

How could she just sit here and wait?

What if something really had happened to William? What would she do then?

Victoria bit her lip hard, made up her mind, and quickly changed into some comfortable clothes, putting on a baseball cap. She was determined to go out and look for him.

Just as her hand grasped the doorknob, the door suddenly swung open from the outside.

Victoria's eyes widened in shock. Standing at the door was William, supporting someone.

"Ms. Scott?" Victoria was both surprised and relieved. She hurried forward to help William bring Daisy into the room, then anxiously looked outside. "Where's my dad? Is he behind you?"

Daisy looked exhausted and worn out, glancing up at Victoria.

Just as she was about to speak, William cut in quietly, "Close the door first. We'll talk inside."

A wave of unease washed over Victoria, a sense of foreboding settling in her heart.

She forced herself to stay calm and nodded.

Once inside, Victoria didn't waste any time. Seeing Daisy's clothes covered in dirt and grime, she quickly found some clean clothes for her to change into.

Daisy's emotions were relatively stable, but her attempt to appear calm was too obvious. Anyone paying attention could see the fear in her eyes.

She looked at Victoria, her lips trembling, and managed to say, "Victoria, I'm sorry."

Victoria was pouring water into a cup when she heard this. Her hand shook, spilling hot water and burning her hand. She let out a small cry and quickly put the cup down.

William reacted instantly, grabbing her hand and carefully checking it. "Did you burn yourself? Is it bad?"

"I'm fine." Victoria pulled her hand back forcefully, not even looking at him.

She turned to Daisy, trying to appear calm, but her eyes betrayed her worry and fear. "Ms. Scott, can you tell me where my dad is now?"

Daisy opened her mouth, but before she could speak, she started coughing violently.

She coughed several times, her whole body hunching over.

From Daisy's halting, tearful account, Victoria finally learned what had happened after they were captured.

That day, Alvin had fought off several gang members to protect Daisy during a gang fight.

One of them was the top enforcer for the local gang, The Raven Syndicate.

After they were captured, the gang wanted to kill them.

It was only because Daisy revealed her identity as a member of the Scott family from Crystalia and offered to pay for their lives that they were temporarily spared.

When William brought the $50 million ransom, the gang demanded three times that amount.

William had no choice but to pay an additional $100 million.

But seeing how generous he was, the gang went back on their word, agreeing to release only one person and demanding $1 billion to release the other.

William had no choice but to get Daisy out first.

Daisy lit a cigarette, her hands shaking. She looked up at Victoria, her voice trembling. "I'm sorry, Victoria. Your dad could have escaped on his own. He stayed because of me. I wanted him to go with William, but he refused."

Hearing this, Victoria's hands clenched tightly at her sides, her face turning pale. "I'm calling the police."

William scoffed. "Call the police? Do you know where we are? This is Xandria! The police and the gangs are in cahoots. Do you think the police will risk crossing The Raven Syndicate for you and your dad? Wake up."

His tone was cold and harsh.

His words felt like a knife to Victoria's chest, making it hard for her to breathe.

Victoria closed her eyes in pain, tears streaming down her face uncontrollably.

Suddenly, she grabbed William tightly, her voice breaking with desperation. "William, please, give me the $1 billion to save my father. I'll do anything for you, work for you for the rest of my life, no complaints. Please."

Her voice was hoarse with despair, her eyes full of pleading.

William looked at Victoria, both angry and anxious.

He bent down, trying to lift her up, but she stubbornly pushed him away.

He sighed, his voice tinged with exhaustion and urgency. "Victoria, get up. Calm down! Even if we could gather $1 billion in cash quickly, do you know what that would mean? Such a large amount could cause international issues. And you saw what The Raven Syndicate is like. They'd take the money and kill us all. We wouldn't save your father, and we might all end up dead."

"I don't believe it! I don't believe they would be so brazen!" Victoria shouted, her voice filled with sorrow and anger. "You just don't want to save my dad! He killed your parents, and you want him dead. I was foolish to trust you. How ridiculous of me!"

William's brow furrowed deeper, his face darkening.

He stared at Victoria, his lips trembling, struggling to speak. "Is that what you think of me?"

"Yes!" Victoria answered without hesitation, her eyes red and swollen, shouting at William with gritted teeth. "In my eyes, you're a despicable, treacherous, heartless bastard! If you won't save him, I will!"

###chapter 169 Too Worried to Stay Calm

Victoria yanked the door open, ready to storm out.

William grabbed her arm, his chest heaving with anger, fists clenched tight.

"Victoria!" he yelled, his voice full of fury.

Victoria didn't flinch. She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze with defiance.

The tension was thick enough to cut with a knife.

Daisy, sensing the escalating situation, quickly stepped in, grabbing William's arm. "William, don't fight with Victoria. She's just upset."

Then Daisy turned to Victoria, her voice soothing. "Victoria, don't get William wrong. He's already got Harry working on getting the money back home, but we need a backup plan, right? What if they take the money and still don't let your dad go? We have to be ready."

"Victoria, can you be reasonable?" William's forehead veins bulged, his anger barely contained. "What are you planning to do? Get yourself killed?"

He turned sharply to Daisy. "Keep an eye on her."

"Okay," Daisy replied softly, stepping forward to hold Victoria's hand. "Listen, Victoria, now's not the time to fight with William. For my sake, he'll do everything he can to save your father."

William paused at the door, giving Victoria a long, intense look before rushing out.

Daisy led Victoria to the couch, sighing as she lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.

"If it weren't for saving me, he wouldn't have been captured."

Victoria pressed her lips together, her eyes shimmering with suppressed emotion.

She wanted to tell Daisy it wasn't her fault, but the words wouldn't come out.

Alvin was captured because of Daisy. As his daughter, how could she not feel any resentment?

But it was Alvin's choice, and she couldn't take her anger out on Daisy.

She lowered her head, staying silent.

Daisy gently ruffled her hair, sighing. "I know you hate William, but I don't want you to make a mistake. This time, stay here and wait for his news. He promised to save your dad, and he won't go back on his word."

Victoria was silent for a long time before she finally responded with a low "okay."

She looked down, pausing for a moment before speaking softly. "I know he's not that kind of person, but I..."

"You're just too worried," Daisy said, patting Victoria's hand gently. "Victoria, listen to me. Only William can help you save your father now."

Victoria fell silent again, nodding after a long pause.

******

In the afternoon, Victoria decided to head to the resort entrance to buy some essentials. Giselle happened to pass by and called out to her.

"Victoria, I told my brother about what happened yesterday. He said he'll handle it, so don't worry."

"I'm not planning to pursue it. I just hope things can be peaceful here at the resort," Victoria said with a faint smile.

"Absolutely, I promise there won't be any more trouble!" Giselle assured her, patting her chest.

Victoria nodded slightly and turned to leave.

When she returned to the resort with her bags, a scream suddenly came from the storage room in the corner.

Her heart tightened, and she quickly looked in the direction of the sound.

Through the crack in the door, she saw Jett and Hayden lying on the ground, covered in blood and groaning in pain.

A burly man stood with his back to her, holding a baseball bat, teaching the two a lesson.

The man crouched down, grabbing Jett by the collar, his voice cold as ice. "Didn't I tell you not to mess with any guests at this resort?"

Jett trembled, his voice shaking as he tried to explain. "Mr. Hopper, I didn't do anything to her, just scared her a bit."

The man yanked him closer, his eyes filled with murderous intent. "You've got some nerve."

Jett shivered even more, quickly pleading. "Mr. Hopper, please spare me. I was wrong. I won't do it again."

"Next time, I'll cripple you," the man said, letting go. Jett collapsed to the ground like a pile of mush.

Victoria clutched her bags tightly, her palms sweaty, staring at the man. She thought, 'Is he Giselle's brother? The owner of this resort? Why does his voice sound so familiar?'

As the man stood up, she instinctively shrank back, trying to hide.

She thought she was well-hidden, but the man seemed to sense something. He turned slowly and walked straight toward her.

Victoria was about to run, but when she saw the scar on his brow and the earring in his left ear, she was stunned.

It was Louie, the man who had chatted with her on the plane!

Today, he wore a simple outfit typical of Xandria's casual style.

A crisp white cotton T-shirt with sparse gold embroidery at the collar, loose shorts at the waist, and flip-flops on his feet.

He looked more relaxed and carefree.

But the sharp aura around him hadn't diminished at all.

Louie approached with steady steps, looking down at Victoria, a hint of surprise in his eyes, followed by a meaningful smile. "Well, well, it's you. We must be destined to meet."

His voice was low and raspy, with a touch of mockery.

Victoria swallowed, trying to stay calm.

She looked up, forcing a stiff smile. "Mr. Hopper, what a coincidence."

Louie narrowed his eyes, suddenly leaning down to meet her gaze. "I remember your name is Victoria, right?"

"Yes, Victoria Carter." Victoria replied, her smile strained.

One of Louie's men leaned in, whispering in his ear. "Jett and Hayden were harassing her."

Louie raised an eyebrow, his gaze turning playful as he looked at Victoria.

She was indeed beautiful, no wonder Jett and Hayden dared to break his rules to harass her.

Even he had tried to chat her up on the plane.

Victoria felt a chill down her spine, instinctively stepping back.

Louie chuckled softly, asking, "Ms. Carter, you were frightened at my resort. As the owner, I owe you an explanation, so..."

He paused deliberately before continuing. "How would you like to settle this? A broken hand? A broken leg? Or something more severe? I can make it happen."

Hearing this, Jett and Hayden turned pale.

They hadn't expected that the woman they harassed was someone Louie was interested in.

They struggled to get up, kneeling at Louie's feet, begging for mercy.

"Mr. Hopper, please spare us. We were wrong. We won't do it again."

"I was wrong. Please let me go."

"Get lost!" Louie kicked them away in disgust.

He looked at Victoria, smiling. "Ms. Carter, how would you like to punish them? Just say the word."

Victoria was stunned for a moment, then quickly shook her head. "No need."

"Really? Ms. Carter, you are kind," Louie said slowly. "In that case, I'll have to handle it differently."

He signaled to his subordinate, Paxton, who understood immediately. Paxton walked over and swung the baseball bat hard at the two men's groins.

###chapter 170 Are You Satisfied?

A piercing scream echoed through the entire vacation house.

Jett clutched his groin, sweat pouring down his forehead.

Hayden had already passed out from the pain, his face twisted in agony.

Victoria was stunned by what she had just witnessed, unable to speak for a moment.

Louie seemed to relish her terrified expression, his smile both sinister and alluring. "Ms. Carter, are you satisfied now?"

Victoria's teeth chattered uncontrollably as she nodded shakily. "Yes."

She had never encountered such a ruthless man before.

Louie was terrifying.

Seeing her still in shock, Louie's interest only grew. He grabbed Victoria's right hand, bringing it to his lips for a kiss, and said softly, "Don't be afraid. As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you."

He then ordered his men to drag Jett and Hayden away.

Louie's men knew what this meant. Despite his reputation for being cold and indifferent to women, it didn't mean he was completely immune to their charms.

During particularly lonely times, he would occasionally seek out female company.

He had never married and had no steady partner. The only woman who was involved with him was Matilda, the sister of his right-hand man, Alfonso.

However, Matilda had been hospitalized with a serious illness for some time, leaving Louie to suppress his desires.

Now, his intentions towards Victoria were unmistakably clear.

Louie's men, seasoned in the underworld, could read his signals perfectly. They exchanged glances, understanding that Louie had taken an interest in Victoria.

Victoria's hand was still in Louie's grip.

She bit her lip, using all her strength to pull her hand away.

Louie held her smooth, delicate fingers, his thumb caressing her soft skin. He chuckled softly, "Ms. Carter, how about you join me for dinner as an apology?"

His tone sent chills down Victoria's spine.

"Sorry, I have other plans."

Louie didn't let go, his grip firm on her slender wrist. "What, you don't want to?"

His gaze was so intense that Victoria felt suffocated, cold sweat forming on her forehead.

Just then, a cold voice interrupted, "Let her go."

Victoria turned to see William standing a short distance away, his expression dark.

Louie looked surprised for a moment, then smirked. "So, it's Ms. Carter's boyfriend. My men were out of line, and I was just inviting her to dinner to apologize. Why so angry?"

Despite his casual words, the challenge in his eyes was clear.

William quickly stepped forward, pulling Victoria into his arms.

"No need. I'll thank Mr. Hopper on her behalf." With that, William took Victoria's hand and started to leave.

Paxton and the others moved to block them, but Louie stopped them.

Louie watched William's retreating figure, a faint smile playing on his lips. "We'll meet again."

******

William's face was stormy as he dragged Victoria back to their room.

Once inside the elevator, he turned abruptly, glaring at her.

"You don't trust me enough? You had to go find The Raven Syndicate's leader yourself to save your father?"

Victoria was baffled by his words. "What are you talking about? I don't know anything about The Raven Syndicate's leader!"

William scoffed. "Don't know him? The man who wouldn't let go of your hand just now is Louie, the leader of The Raven Syndicate."

He turned to leave.

Victoria bit her lip and hurried after him.

"William!" she called, catching up. "I was just out buying some essentials. I happened to see him punishing the two men who harassed me yesterday. They tried to break into my room again today."

William stopped in his tracks, turning to her with a frown. "When did that happen?"

Victoria nodded quickly. "This morning, after you left."

William's eyes narrowed slightly. "I see."

His expression softened a bit as he looked at her. "When I'm not around, stay in the room. It's too dangerous outside."

Seeing his anger subside, Victoria cautiously approached. "Is that man really the leader of The Raven Syndicate? The one who took my father?"

"Yes." William glanced at her. "So when I saw you there, I was furious and worried. I just wanted to get you back and teach you a lesson."

Victoria could guess what kind of "lesson" he meant.

She bit her lip, then looked up at him. "Since he's the one responsible, can we..."

William quickly covered her mouth. "Shut up! This is his territory. Do you want to get yourself killed?"

Realizing how reckless her idea was, Victoria fell silent.

William, seeing her finally calm down, relaxed a bit and led her back to their room.

After a moment of silence, Victoria couldn't help but ask, "My father..."

William gently pulled her closer. "We'll talk in the room."

"I understand, but you don't have to hold me like this." Victoria tried to pull away, but William held her tighter, whispering in her ear, "Someone might be watching."

Victoria froze, not daring to move.

William's lips curled into a barely noticeable smile as he led her to their room.

Once inside, he still didn't let go until Victoria pushed his hand away.

The room was filled with the smell of smoke.

Daisy stood by the window, a cigarette between her fingers, the ashtray overflowing with butts.

"Why so many?" William frowned, opening the window to air out the room.

Daisy quickly asked, "How did it go?"

Victoria also looked at William anxiously.

"I found where they're holding him," William replied. "Tonight, I'll take some men and sneak in."

He paused before adding, "If all goes well, I'll have him out by tomorrow."

###chapter 171 How to Forgive?

"That's good, that's good," Daisy sighed in relief, her whole body seeming to deflate as she collapsed onto the couch and fell into a deep sleep.

She hadn't had a good night's sleep in ages.

Victoria grabbed a blanket and gently covered her.

Then she gave William a look, signaling him to follow her into another room of the suite.

William could tell she had something to say, so he followed her without a word.

Once inside, Victoria stared at him intently, trying to read his expression.

She couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

But she couldn't pinpoint what it was, or maybe she was just too scared, causing her to imagine things.

William quickly noticed Victoria's gaze on him. His eyes fell on her pale face, and he frowned slightly.

"What are you looking at?" he asked calmly.

"Do you think you can do it?"

Hearing the worry in her voice, William felt a surprising warmth in his heart. He looked at her with a faint smile. "Are you worried about me, or worried that I won't be able to save your dad?"

Victoria bit her lip and said nothing.

"If something happens to me, wouldn't you be free? You wouldn't have to deal with me anymore, or be tangled up in all this mess. You could completely move on, live the life you want, marry Samuel, have kids, and..."

"Stop it!" Victoria suddenly looked up, her eyes red as she interrupted him. "Do you think saying this is funny? Does it make you feel accomplished? Do you think saying this will make me feel guilty, make me reluctant to let you go? Well, it won't! I'll just feel relieved, finally free from you! I'll be happy every day, and I'll forget all about you!"

Her eyes were red, tears clinging to her lashes, making her look especially pitiful.

William was stunned, staring at her in a daze, unable to react.

He suddenly remembered the first time he met her, how she looked when she cried. Back then, she was like a wounded kitten, fragile and helpless.

At that time, Alvin was already in prison, and he hadn't planned on seeking further revenge.

But seeing Victoria's pitiful appearance, he impulsively suggested becoming her sugar daddy.

He told himself it was just to get back at Alvin, not because he had any feelings for Victoria.

Maybe he had been wrong from the start.

If he could do it over, he would protect her, not let anyone hurt her, including himself.

William looked at her deeply, feeling a soft spot in his heart being gently touched.

Suddenly, he pulled Victoria into his arms.

"Let go of me! You jerk! I have a boyfriend, you have no right to hold me like this! William! I'm warning you! Don't touch me! You bastard, you scoundrel!"

Her struggle was pointless, and all she could do was shouting: "Get off me! Let go! I hate you! I never want to see you again! You piece of trash!"

"If you keep cursing, I might not be able to resist making love to you," he whispered in her ear, his tone calm.

Victoria froze, staring at him in disbelief. "You're crazy!"

"Stop it," William scolded softly in her ear.

Victoria was stunned, her body ceasing to struggle.

After a moment, she seemed to come to her senses and punched William hard in the chest.

But William didn't let go, instead holding her even tighter.

"Victoria, I'm really sorry," he said, his voice low and hoarse, filled with helplessness and fatigue. "What happened back then was my fault. You can blame me. But Victoria, I really love you. Whether you believe it or not, if I save your father, can you forgive me?"

He didn't say anything more, just rested his chin on Victoria's shoulder, holding her as if he wanted to merge her into his body.

At that moment, Victoria found herself speechless, overwhelmed with emotion.

She had always thought William would never bow to her, that he would always be proud and strong. But she never expected him to have such a moment of helplessness and humility.

William, who had always been so high and mighty, was now holding her tightly, apologizing in a low voice.

But the obstacles between them were no longer just about Alice.

As long as the truth about his parents' death remained unknown, Alvin would be responsible in William's eyes.

And Alvin's imprisonment was partly William's doing.

Not to mention the past two years of humiliation and torment she had endured from him, all in the name of revenge against Alvin.

Forgive him?

How could she?

Victoria closed her eyes, hiding the tumultuous emotions within.

After a long while, she slowly spoke, her voice choked and hoarse. "William, it's impossible for us."

William's body shook violently, then he released Victoria.

Seeing his desolate expression, Victoria bit her lip and looked away.

William was silent for a moment before he slowly said, "No matter what, I'll save your dad. Don't worry."

Hearing this, Victoria looked up at him. After a moment, she slowly said, "William, if-I'm saying if-something goes wrong, I want you to protect yourself first. You have no obligation to risk your life for my dad. It's not worth it for anyone."

William looked deeply at Victoria. After a long pause, he slowly replied, "I understand. You stay here and wait for news. I'll go prepare."

With that, he turned and left, his figure appearing lonely and desolate.

Victoria watched his tall, rigid back, her eyes gradually filling with tears.

After William left, Daisy came in.

It turned out she hadn't been asleep earlier; she just wanted to give them space to talk.

But the outcome might not have been what she had hoped for.

Daisy hadn't slept in two or three days, dark circles under her eyes making her look even more haggard.

Seeing her worn-out appearance, Victoria couldn't help but urge, "Ms. Scott, why don't you get some sleep? I'll wake you if there's any news."

Daisy waved her off, pulling out a cigarette and lighting it. She took a deep drag and exhaled a long stream of smoke.

Then she mechanically took out another cigarette and offered it to Victoria.

This time, Victoria didn't refuse. She took the cigarette, lit it, and sat on the couch with Daisy.

Outside, the night grew darker.

Daisy became increasingly restless, her fingers tapping incessantly on her knees.

However, in front of Victoria, she tried to maintain her composure, though her hand trembled uncontrollably as she tried to light the cigarette. After several failed attempts, she threw the lighter and unlit cigarette onto the table in frustration.

Seeing this, Victoria silently got up and poured a glass of water, placing it gently in front of Daisy.

After a moment's hesitation, she softly asked, "Ms. Scott, can I ask why you followed my dad to Xandria?"

Hearing this, Daisy gave a bitter smile and looked up at Victoria. "Because I love your dad. I've loved him for over ten years."

###chapter 172 Help!

Victoria was floored.

Even though she had long suspected that Daisy and Alvin had something going on, hearing Daisy come right out and say it still hit her hard.

"What about my dad? What does he think?"

Daisy's eyes clouded over, her face full of sorrow. "Your dad was actually my first love. Back then, I used to go with my brother and sister-in-law, William's parents, to check on the bridge construction. Your dad was a brilliant designer, always so knowledgeable, gentle, and polite to everyone. He was super dedicated, often working late into the night."

As Daisy reminisced, a small smile crept onto her lips.

"The more time I spent with him, the more I liked him. But I knew he was married, so I never dared to show my feelings. Later, I accidentally found out he was going through a divorce with your mom. I admit I was a bit happy then. But when I learned they didn't go through with it, I gave up. After that, the bridge collapsed, and my brother and sister-in-law died in the accident. I had to help manage the company and take care of William, so I gradually drifted apart from your dad."

Daisy paused, seemingly lost in the past.

"Two years ago, I heard your dad was being blamed for the bridge collapse. I rushed to the detention center to see him. I never believed it was his fault, but for some reason, he admitted it was. Recently, when I told him you were going to donate a kidney to your mom, he got anxious. With William's and my help, we managed to get him out on parole."

Victoria felt a whirlwind of emotions after hearing Daisy's explanation.

So, Alvin and the Scott family had such a deep connection.

"I came to Xandria with your dad to help him secure the old town renovation project. I never expected things to turn out like this. It's all my fault." Daisy looked at Victoria with guilt, gently stroking her hair. "Victoria, I'm sorry."

Victoria shook her head and sighed softly. "This isn't your fault. It's my dad's choice."

Daisy's hand slowly dropped, her gaze shifting to the window. "You know, Victoria, when your parents were going through their divorce, I proposed to your dad, but he turned me down."

Victoria was taken aback, looking at Daisy in surprise.

Daisy gave a bitter smile and continued, "I was young and impulsive then, completely in love with him. I thought as long as two people loved each other, nothing could stand in their way. I didn't care about the difference in our family status or societal views. I even planned to run away with him and live a life just for us."

Her eyes softened, as if she was seeing her brave, younger self again.

"But he refused me outright. He said he had responsibilities and a family to take care of. He couldn't be so reckless."

Daisy's voice grew quieter, tinged with sadness. "I was so angry and hurt then, thinking he didn't understand my feelings. I wanted to forget him completely, but it wasn't that easy."

Victoria listened quietly, feeling a pang of sorrow in her heart.

She had never imagined that Alvin and Daisy had such a deep and complicated relationship.

Daisy sighed softly and turned to Victoria. "Victoria, I know it might be a weird time to say this, but I want you to know that my feelings for your dad have never changed. If he comes back safely this time, I'll do whatever it takes to be with him."

Victoria couldn't help but laugh, looking at Daisy with a smile. "Alright, I'll be on your side then."

Daisy playfully tapped her on the head. "You little rascal!"

Victoria chuckled and suddenly said, "Ms. Scott, you must be hungry. We don't know how long we'll have to wait tonight. I'll go to the resort's restaurant and get us something to eat."

Daisy thought for a moment and agreed. They needed their strength for what lay ahead.

She nodded. "Alright, I'll go with you."

"No need. You stay here and rest. The resort has security patrolling everywhere. It's safe. You haven't slept for a day and a night. You need to rest."

Daisy hesitated but eventually nodded, reminding her, "Be careful and come back soon."

Victoria left the room and headed to the restaurant.

As she reached a corner, she was about to step forward when she noticed a woman approaching.

The woman wore a brightly colored dress adorned with intricate golden patterns. A belt studded with colorful gems accentuated her graceful figure.

Her long, shiny hair was loosely tied up, with a few strands falling around her slender neck.

She wore large silver earrings that swayed with her movements, making a crisp sound.

She was strikingly beautiful.

The woman stopped about two feet from Victoria, scrutinizing her.

Victoria frowned and took a cautious step back, trying to avoid her.

But the woman seemed to anticipate her move, quickly stepping to block her path, staring intently at her. "So pretty, no wonder men like you."

Victoria shivered, finding the woman's behavior extremely odd. Alarm bells rang in her mind, and she wanted to return to the room.

"Move, I need to go back."

The woman didn't budge, a strange smile on her lips. "Don't blame me, blame Louie for liking you."

Victoria's heart tightened. Before she could react, a hand covered her mouth and nose from behind.

A pungent smell hit her.

Ether!

Victoria struggled desperately, trying to pry the hand away and kicking wildly.

But gradually, her strength waned, and her vision blurred. Finally, she went limp and passed out.

When she came to, her head was throbbing painfully.

She opened her eyes with difficulty and found herself in a dim room, the air damp and musty.

Moss covered the walls, and old, broken items were scattered in the corners. The only window was boarded up, letting in no light.

Terrified, Victoria tried to get up, only to realize her hands and feet were tightly bound.

"Help!" she tried to shout, but her throat felt like it was on fire, her voice hoarse and weak.

###chapter 173 You Smell Nice

Not long after, the door to the room swung open, and the woman from earlier sauntered in, swaying her hips.

She looked at the terrified Victoria, a smug, cold smile curling her lips. "Well, look who's awake."

She took a few steps forward, crouched down in front of Victoria, and grabbed her chin, forcing her to look up. "Don't blame me for being ruthless. Blame that pretty face of yours for making Louie lose his mind over you. I worked hard to get into Louie's bed. There's no way I'm letting you ruin it."

The malice in the woman's eyes made Victoria shudder. She gritted her teeth and snapped, "You're nuts! I don't even like Louie."

Before she could finish, the woman, Matilda, slapped her hard across the face, cursing, "Cut the crap! I've been with Louie for three years. Plenty of women have tried to seduce him, but I've never seen him so obsessed with anyone before. You bitch!"

With that, she raised her hand and slapped Victoria again.

The stinging pain brought Victoria back to her senses. She glared at the woman, her voice trembling with anger. "Didn't you say Louie cares about me? Aren't you afraid he'll come after you for this?"

The woman laughed mockingly, looking at Victoria with disdain. "Louie hates dirty people. If I have you raped first, the most he'll do is scold me. He won't do anything more."

She then opened the door and called in a few burly, rough-looking men, who were grinning wickedly. "Here's a treat for you guys. This one's a rare beauty."

The men rubbed their hands together, their lecherous eyes roaming over Victoria.

Victoria felt a chill run down her spine. She struggled with all her might, screaming, "Get away from me! You bastards! Don't touch me!"

"Really?" One of the men rubbed his hands together, eager to start.

Matilda giggled. "Go ahead and have fun. I'll handle Louie."

She tossed a phone to one of the men and instructed, "Turn on the camera and record everything."

The man eagerly took the phone and did as she said.

Victoria's pupils contracted in fear as the men closed in on her. Her heart felt like it was sinking into an icy abyss, and she could barely breathe.

Just when she thought all hope was lost, there was a sudden commotion outside. The door was kicked open, and Louie stormed in with his men. Without a word, he grabbed one of the men by the collar and punched him square in the face.

The man screamed and was sent flying.

Louie glared at him, then picked up a brick from the floor and smashed it against another man's head.

The man's forehead split open, blood gushing out.

Matilda was so terrified she couldn't move, collapsing to the floor. "Louie..."

Paxton brought over a chair, and Louie sat down, crossing his legs casually. He looked at her with eyes as cold as ice. "Who gave you the guts?"

"Louie, I'm sorry! I was wrong!" Matilda hadn't expected Louie to arrive so quickly.

Knowing his temper, she crawled over, resting her head on his leg and pleading, "Louie, I was wrong. I was out of my mind. Please don't be mad. Let me make it up to you."

She didn't care that others were in the room. Her hand trembled as she reached up his leg.

Her wrist was caught.

She looked up, staring at Louie, tears streaming down her face.

His handsome face showed no emotion. He calmly lit a cigarette and brushed off his clothes. "Paxton, lock her up with those men."

Matilda's face turned as white as a sheet. She desperately tried to back away. "No! Louie, please! No!"

Louie didn't spare her another glance.

Hayden stepped forward, grabbing her like a ragdoll and dragging her away without mercy.

Victoria struggled to sit up, looking at Louie. He was watching her with a meaningful smile.

Thinking of Alvin still in his hands, Victoria forced down her fear and anger, trying to keep her voice steady. "Thanks for earlier."

Louie smirked. "Where's your boyfriend? Why isn't he with you?"

Victoria's heart tightened, instantly on alert.

What did he mean by that? Had he figured out William's plan?

She chose her words carefully. "I just went downstairs to get some food. He can't follow me everywhere."

Louie chuckled, his eyes unreadable, his tone teasing. "Because of you, I had to get rid of my only woman. What do you think I should do with you?"

Victoria's eyes widened. She wanted to argue but was wary of his power. She cautiously explained, "I don't even know who she is or what your relationship is. Isn't it a bit unfair to blame me?"

"Unfair?" He laughed. "There's no such thing as fairness in this world."

He leaned closer, staring at her with undisguised desire, his hand slowly caressing her cheek.

Victoria knew resisting was futile and provoking him would be suicidal.

She sat there stiffly, letting his hand slide from her cheek to her neck.

Louie was surprised by how soft and smooth her skin was, his desire to possess her growing stronger.

He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "You smell good."

His voice was thick with lust, making Victoria shiver.

Louie suddenly scooped her up, startling her into grabbing his shirt. "Let's play a game. I'll give your boyfriend an hour. If he can show up and take you away, I'll pretend this never happened."

"He's not my boyfriend, just..." Victoria stammered, unable to explain that William was her ex-sugar daddy.

"Just what?" Louie chuckled, a glint in his eye. "A lover?"

Victoria didn't know how to respond, so she stayed silent. She bit her lip and said, "It doesn't matter what he is. He doesn't know I'm in trouble or where I am. How could he get here in an hour?"

Louie smiled wickedly. "The clock starts now."

Victoria's eyes filled with desperation. "You can't do this."

Louie placed her in his black Rolls-Royce, casually reminding her, "Fifty-nine minutes left."

With that, he walked around the car, got into the driver's seat, and drove off.

A few minutes later, the car stopped in front of a luxurious restaurant.

As soon as Louie got out, the restaurant manager hurried over, bowing and scraping, and quickly ordered the staff to clear the place.

###chapter 174 Not Bad

The manager stole a glance and noticed Victoria standing behind Louie, looking a bit surprised.

Louie rarely brought women to these kinds of places. Even when he did, it was usually for business, never with this kind of special treatment.

Though he was a mob boss, and "devoted" wasn't a word typically associated with him, for someone of his status, he was considered quite restrained.

The crystal chandelier cast a diamond-like light on Louie's shoulder. He turned slightly and gestured for the manager to hand the menu to Victoria. "What do you wanna eat?"

Victoria hesitated for just a moment before taking the menu. Since she was already here, she decided to face it calmly.

Besides, she couldn't afford to make any mistakes now, so she unceremoniously ordered a few signature dishes.

Louie lit a cigarette, squinting at her with a slight smile on his lips.

He always disliked pretentious women, and Victoria's straightforwardness made him appreciate her a bit more.

Victoria was also quite surprised. She thought she would be too nervous to enjoy the food.

But looking at the table full of delicious dishes, her appetite opened up, and she began to eat heartily.

When she was full, she couldn't help but burp, feeling a bit embarrassed as she put down her utensils.

Louie, who was leisurely savoring his food across from her, chuckled at her puffed cheeks and teased, "Did you not eat for a week?"

Despite his words, he raised his hand to call the manager and softly said, "Dessert."

"Yes, sir." The manager responded quickly, ordering the staff to clear the plates and bring out an array of exquisite desserts.

Victoria glanced at them and, without further ado, picked her favorites and started eating.

Louie's smile grew wider, and his gaze at Victoria became more curious. "So, what do you do?"

"I'm just a small-time artist," Victoria replied casually, trying to reveal as little as possible without lying.

Louie's eyes lit up with interest, and he raised an eyebrow. "Really? Interesting. Could you draw a portrait of me?"

Victoria instinctively tried to decline. "I didn't bring my art supplies, so I can't."

Louie chuckled softly and called the manager over, whispering a few instructions.

Soon, the manager returned with several waiters, who quickly set up a complete set of brand-new art supplies on the table, from various brushes to paper and easels.

Seeing this, Victoria knew she couldn't refuse any longer. Reluctantly, she picked up a pencil and said, "I'll just do a simple sketch for you then."

She looked up at Louie, carefully studying his features.

She had to admit, Louie had that rugged, handsome look that artists loved to draw.

Taking a deep breath, she steadied herself and began to sketch.

She meticulously outlined each line, every stroke done with great care.

In no time, a lifelike portrait emerged on the paper.

The Louie in the drawing had deep, soulful eyes that seemed to hold endless stories and secrets, drawing anyone in with a single glance.

His high, straight nose added a touch of sternness to his face, enhancing his overall rugged appeal.

The slight upward curve of his thin lips was just right, exuding a mix of nonchalance and playfulness, as if he didn't care about anything yet controlled everything.

His skin on the paper had a unique texture, with a primal intensity that seemed ready to burst forth, making the drawn Louie even more mysterious and captivating than the real one.

Victoria put down her pencil and exhaled softly, relieved that her years of practice had paid off.

At least the drawing looked presentable and wouldn't offend the unpredictable mob boss in front of her.

Louie remained relaxed in his chair, his eyes flashing with a hint of admiration as he looked at the portrait.

He knew he was good-looking, but the version of himself that Victoria had captured had a unique charm.

It was as if she had stripped away all his layers, revealing his most genuine and mesmerizing side.

"Not bad," Louie said, sitting up slightly and taking a closer look at the drawing.

Victoria lowered her head slightly and softly said, "Thanks for the compliment."

Louie looked at her, his eyes filled with amusement. "You're quite talented for a small-time artist. But having good drawing skills is one thing; understanding people is the real talent."

He put the drawing down, leaned forward, and locked eyes with Victoria.

Instinctively, Victoria leaned back, her heart racing, but she tried to keep her voice steady. "I'm just an artist. People are complicated; I don't understand them that well."

Louie chuckled and leaned back in his chair, tapping the armrest rhythmically. "It's okay if you don't understand now. You'll have plenty of chances to learn."

He glanced at his watch and said with a light laugh, "In five minutes, you'll be mine."

The previously pleasant conversation atmosphere instantly shattered. Victoria bit her lip and muttered, "I never agreed to any bet or deal."

Louie laughed softly.

When he laughed, he had a somewhat refined look, but the smile never reached his eyes, lacking any warmth.

He didn't respond, just leaned back in his chair with a lazy yet confident demeanor, as if he controlled everything.

Paxton, who had been standing behind him, spoke up, "Ms. Carter, you're the first person Mr. Hopper has ever set aside an hour for."

Victoria was slightly taken aback. She didn't see it as something to be proud of, only feeling immense pressure.

Louie glanced at Paxton, his eyes cold. "Don't speak out of turn."

Paxton quickly lowered his head, repeatedly apologizing.

Louie turned back to Victoria, a faint smile on his face. "Formalities must be observed."

In truth, whether William showed up within the hour didn't matter to him.

From the moment he first saw Victoria, he had made up his mind. He wanted her.

Victoria didn't know where she found the courage, but she stared straight at Louie, trying to keep her voice calm. "Mr. Hopper, thank you for the hospitality, but I have no intention of switching men."

Louie merely raised an eyebrow, a mocking smile on his lips. "I'm giving you a choice so you can accept it willingly. But if you don't appreciate it..."

He paused, then suddenly changed the subject. "Alvin is your father, right?"

Hearing that name, Victoria's eyes widened, and she could no longer maintain her composure. She slammed her hands on the table. "Don't you dare hurt my dad!"

Louie shrugged, looking innocent. "He's quite stubborn, but you seem to misunderstand. I didn't capture him; he's not in my hands."

###chapter 175 Negotiation

"No way!" Victoria's eyes widened in disbelief. She couldn't believe anyone else in Xandria would be bold enough to kidnap a foreigner.

"A gang called 'The Iron Crocodiles' has been getting gutsier lately, causing trouble all over Xandria and targeting wealthy foreigners," Louie explained calmly, a thin trail of smoke rising from his cigarette, obscuring his face.

"And what about them saying my dad hurt some of your guys?" Victoria's voice rose involuntarily.

"That idiot," Louie sneered, narrowing his eyes with disdain. "He's been trying to climb the ranks and take my place. He secretly joined The Iron Crocodiles, causing trouble and using my name to show off, trying to play both sides for his own gain."

Victoria was stunned by the complexity of the situation. Did William know about this?

"How could it be like this?" Victoria frowned deeply.

Louie stared at her intently, his gaze direct and intense. "You mentioned fairness before, didn't you? I don't like forcing people. I'll help you save your dad, and you stay by my side. Fair enough, right?"

He glanced at his watch nonchalantly. "You don't have much time to think. Two minutes left."

Victoria was about to speak when the restaurant door was suddenly thrown open.

Paxton and his men quickly moved to block the intruder. "This place is cleared out. Who let you in?"

The newcomer ignored them, swiftly throwing Paxton aside with a shoulder throw.

Victoria turned in shock, her eyes welling up with tears when she recognized the person.

Louie remained seated, watching the intruder calmly.

William strode forward, his long legs quickly bringing him to the table. He pulled out a chair and sat next to Victoria, draping an arm over the back of her chair, half-protecting her.

He tilted his chin up slightly, looking at Louie with a careless, confident smile. "Didn't I tell you to wait for me at the hotel? How could you just run off with another man? Aren't you afraid he'll sell you off?"

Victoria was anxious, wanting to ask about Alvin, but the words stuck in her throat.

William's fingers lightly brushed her shoulder. The gesture seemed casual, yet it carried a hint of reassurance.

Victoria understood and obediently kept quiet.

Louie chuckled, the sound echoing in the silent restaurant with a hint of mockery. "Speaking of which, Mr. Scott, aren't you the other man too?"

Victoria, who had just picked up her water glass to calm herself, nearly choked at his words.

She turned her head awkwardly, her cheeks flushing, not daring to look at either of them.

William, however, seemed unfazed, even admitting openly, "Yeah. But she's completely smitten with me; that's why she can't leave me."

Victoria's eyebrows twitched. Hearing him say that made her feel like a fickle woman, so she decided to just accept the situation and not bother explaining.

As they spoke, William took her hand, bringing it to his lips for a light kiss.

Victoria instinctively tried to pull her hand back but noticed the blood and bruises on his knuckles, evidence of a recent fight.

Her heart tightened, and she immediately took his hand in both of hers, examining it closely.

She opened her mouth but said nothing, simply looking up at William.

In that moment, William's gaze softened immensely.

He smiled gently, pulling his hand back to ruffle her hair affectionately. "It's all okay now."

"Really?" Victoria's voice trembled, filled with hope.

"Yes," William confirmed, his fingers gently smoothing her slightly messy hair.

Victoria lowered her eyes, finally relaxing her tense nerves.

She clung to William's hand, refusing to let go.

William looked down at their intertwined hands, then wrapped her cold hand in his, gently rubbing it.

"All okay?" Louie raised an eyebrow, chuckling softly, breaking the brief moment of warmth. "If everything's fine, Mr. Scott, why did you come looking for me?"

Victoria's unease returned, and she looked at William, her voice low. "Is something wrong?"

William ignored her question, turning to her instead. "Are you full?"

Victoria was taken aback, then nodded instinctively. "Yes, I'm full."

"Good." William smiled, patting her back gently like comforting a child. "There's a drink shop across the street. Go check it out."

Victoria frowned, thinking to herself: Is he trying to get rid of me? That's pretty blunt!

William seemed to read her mind, squeezing her hand affectionately. "Go on, wait for me there."

Though reluctant, Victoria stood up. Just as she was about to leave, William handed her his wallet. "Get whatever you want. Don't hold back."

Victoria pouted. If it weren't for the situation, she would have rolled her eyes at him.

William really treated her like a child!

Thankfully, Louie's men didn't stop her. Victoria obediently left and saw the charming drink shop across the street.

She picked a flavor at random and sat inside, watching the restaurant through the large window.

She saw William and Louie sitting across from each other, the tension palpable.

Her brows furrowed, and her heart ached.

William was strong; he should be fine, right?

She wanted to call Daisy to check if Alvin was back, but her phone was dead.

How did William find her?

Just then, Paxton exited the restaurant, followed by Louie.

Louie glanced in her direction, a meaningful smile on his lips, before getting into his car.

Soon after, William emerged.

He walked straight to the drink shop, and Victoria quickly got up to meet him.

"What did you say to him? Are you making a deal?" Victoria blurted out, her anxiety evident.

William looked around cautiously, taking her hand and leading her away. "We reached a small agreement."

Victoria stopped abruptly, staring at him. "William! He's Louie! The head of an illegal organization!"

###chapter 176 I Miss You

"So, he's the only one who can handle this." William knew he had to lay it all out for Victoria, or she'd never be at ease.

"Your dad's in the hands of The Iron Crocodiles right now. They're like a pack of hungry wolves, greedy and totally untrustworthy. The minute we paid the first ransom, they saw us as a goldmine. They demanded a second payment, then a third. When they can't squeeze any more out of us, that's when things get really dangerous."

Victoria's face went pale, her lips trembling as she listened to William.

He went on, "We're in a foreign country, so we gotta be extra careful. To deal with The Iron Crocodiles, we need to use local forces. Louie's been wanting to take them down for a while. I made him a deal: I provide the money, he provides the manpower. He had no reason to say no."

Victoria's heart raced as she asked, her voice shaking, "So, are we gonna act soon?"

"Pretty much." William didn't go into detail. After all, a gang war would be a brutal, bloody affair.

Victoria didn't ask further, but she had a rough idea of what was coming.

"Are you going?" Victoria looked up, her eyes filled with worry and fear.

William suddenly bent down, meeting her gaze, and looked deeply into her eyes. "Do you want me to go?"

Victoria pressed her lips together and turned away. "It's your decision, don't ask me."

But William gently turned her face back to him, his eyes locking onto hers. "I've heard that The Iron Crocodiles are all tough guys, armed with heavy weapons, and they're all desperados. Even if I hire mercenaries, casualties are inevitable."

"Don't go!" Victoria, as if greatly shocked, grabbed William's arm tightly, her fingers turning white, her eyes full of panic. "Why does it have to be like this? Maybe there's another way, it doesn't have to be a fight to the death."

William gazed at her and suddenly asked, "Worried about me? Afraid something will happen to me?"

Victoria closed her mouth again, but her face couldn't hide her concern.

William lowered his eyes slightly, a warm feeling rising in his heart. He whispered, "It's worth it."

"What?" Victoria looked at him, puzzled.

William gently pried her fingers off his arm, one by one, his expression seemingly casual, but his tone was firm. "I've never broken a promise to you, and this time is no different."

Victoria felt a heavy weight in her heart, like a stone pressing down.

She had so much to say, but looking at William, she couldn't utter a word.

William, however, seemed oblivious and naturally changed the subject.

He leaned in slightly, his warm breath brushing her ear, and chuckled softly. "Louie told me you said you weren't planning to find another man."

Victoria was stunned.

She could hear the hint of hope in his words, but she avoided his gaze, responding with a forced, almost cold rationality. "I was talking about Samuel."

The name "Samuel" was like a cold barrier, instantly extinguishing the small spark in William's eyes.

William quietly stared at her, the warmth in his gaze cooling visibly.

She could feel him pulling away.

"Is that so?" He responded flatly, his tone devoid of emotion.

Victoria lowered her eyes and softly replied, her voice barely audible.

Quinton drove them back, and the two maintained a silent understanding, the car engine's hum the only sound in the confined space.

Back at the resort, William told her to go up first, saying he had some things to handle.

Victoria hesitated before getting out of the car, then turned back to caution him. "Be careful, if..."

"I know." William cut her off, signaling Quinton to drive away.

Victoria stood at the resort entrance, staring at the car's retreating figure for a long time before turning to go inside.

As she stepped into the lobby, Giselle hurried over, calling softly, "Victoria, you have a call."

Puzzled, Victoria walked to the front desk and picked up the phone.

"Victoria!" Samuel's anxious voice came through. "Why is your phone off?"

"Battery died," Victoria explained. "I was out shopping and didn't notice."

Samuel sighed in relief, and they chatted for a bit.

Finally, he spoke with a complicated tone. "I promised to come help you, but something came up here, and I can't leave. I'm sorry, Victoria."

"Is everything okay?" Victoria asked, concerned.

Samuel hesitated before continuing. "It's nothing major, I'll sort it out soon."

His studio had been accused of tax evasion and money laundering through high-priced artwork. Though the accusations were false, he was barred from leaving the country until the matter was resolved.

He knew it was William's doing.

All this just to keep him away from Victoria.

Hearing this, Victoria felt relieved. "As long as you're okay. I'm fine here, don't worry."

There was a moment of silence on the other end, followed by a soft laugh.

Samuel said, "If people knew how understanding my girlfriend is, they'd be so envious. But I wish you'd act like other girls sometimes, throw a tantrum or get mad at me."

Victoria laughed. "Alright, I'll be a difficult girlfriend from now on."

"Great!" Samuel laughed heartily. "I look forward to it."

Victoria chuckled. "Just don't get annoyed with me then."

"Never. You'll always be my princess." Samuel sighed softly. "Victoria, I miss you."

Victoria paused, then said, "I miss you too."

After hanging up, she turned to see Daisy.

Daisy, holding a newly bought pack of cigarettes, was leaning against the wall, watching her.

For some reason, Victoria felt a pang of guilt.

"Let's go eat something," Daisy said, taking Victoria's hand. Though Victoria wasn't hungry, she didn't refuse and followed her.

Daisy had been smoking almost non-stop for the past day and night, even during meals.

Victoria, having just eaten, only ordered a juice and watched Daisy eat.

Neither mentioned the plan to rescue Alvin, but it was all they could think about.

Finally, Daisy put down her utensils, took a deep drag of her cigarette, and said, "If anything happens to him, I'll move into your place with his ashes."

###chapter 177 I've Made up My Mind about Him

Victoria stared at Daisy, her eyes wide with shock and emotion.

"I'm not like you young folks, always tangled in those love triangles. I've made up my mind about him, but he keeps dodging me," Daisy said, taking another drag from her cigarette, the smoke swirling around her. "If he really dies, at least I'll have done my part. After that, I'll look after you, see you get married, help you with your kids."

As she spoke, Daisy chuckled, "Thinking about it, it's kind of funny."

Victoria felt a pang in her heart. How had she never noticed Daisy's deep feelings for Alvin?

She reached out and snatched the cigarette from Daisy's hand, extinguishing it in the ashtray. "Stop talking like that. My dad will come back safe and sound. When he does, I'll make sure he gives you an explanation! If he tries to dodge it, I'll be the first to hold him accountable!"

Daisy's face softened into a smile. "Alright, that's sweet of you. I knew I didn't spoil you for nothing."

As night fell, enveloping the world in darkness, neither Victoria nor Daisy wanted to sit idly in the room.

They sat side by side on the wicker chairs at the resort, quietly waiting. Despite their anxiety, they maintained a calm exterior.

Daisy's hand unconsciously reached for her cigarette pack again, but Victoria quickly snatched it away, saying firmly, "In the Carter family, new members aren't allowed to smoke."

Daisy widened her eyes, pretending to be angry. "You're pulling my leg! I've never heard your dad say that."

"There is, because I say so," Victoria replied seriously.

Daisy shook her head, half amused, half exasperated. "You always know how to get to me."

Just then, the sound of a car engine roared closer. A familiar car sped into the resort.

Before the car even stopped, Victoria's face changed, and she jumped up, running towards it. "Quinton!"

"Ms. Carter, get in the car!" Quinton shouted urgently, not wasting any time.

Victoria climbed in without hesitation, and Daisy quickly followed.

As the car sped off, Quinton explained, "Mr. Carter is back, but he's injured and at the hospital."

Victoria's mind went blank, a buzzing sound filling her ears. Daisy's face turned as white as a sheet. "Where is he hurt? Is it serious?"

"I don't know the details. I came straight to get you as soon as I heard."

Quinton, familiar with the roads, quickly got them to the only decent hospital in Xandria.

Victoria jumped out of the car and immediately spotted Paxton.

"Louie sent me to bring you up," Paxton said briefly, turning to lead the way.

Victoria, frantic with worry, ran so fast her hairband fell off, her long hair streaming behind her as she followed Paxton.

Her usually beautiful face was now full of anxiety, her eyes red and puffy, like a delicate vase on the verge of breaking.

When she reached Louie, he looked at her quietly for a long moment before finally looking away.

"Where's my dad?" she asked, her voice trembling with urgency.

Louie tilted his head towards a nearby direction.

At that moment, Alvin, bandaged up, slowly walked out.

"Dad!" Victoria cried, rushing to his side, supporting him. "Are you okay? Where are you hurt?"

Alvin patted her hand gently. "I'm fine."

Victoria's eyes filled with tears. "How can you be fine? You're bleeding."

"I'm not lying," Alvin said, caressing her cheek tenderly. "It's just a scratch, nothing serious."

"Thank goodness," Victoria sobbed, tears streaming down her face.

Daisy hurried over, concern etched on her face. "Alvin, are you alright? Is it bad?"

Victoria wiped her tears and stepped aside to give them some space.

Seeing Daisy's worried expression, Alvin smiled faintly. "I'm okay."

Daisy finally relaxed, tears flowing freely as she hugged Alvin tightly. "You scared me. I was so afraid of losing you."

"I'm sorry, it's all my fault for making you worry," Alvin said, his voice full of guilt.

Daisy clung to him, her nails digging into his back. "You idiot! Do you think playing hero is cool?"

Despite her well-maintained appearance, Daisy was in her forties, and the stress of recent days had taken its toll, fine lines appearing at the corners of her eyes.

Seeing this vulnerable side of her, Alvin felt a strange pang in his heart. They were both getting older.

Alvin glanced nervously at Victoria, afraid she might be angry.

But Victoria wasn't looking at them. She was searching for William.

After scanning the area, she finally saw Harry entering the room.

He had arrived before the action started, but Victoria hadn't noticed him in the rush.

Seeing him, Victoria rushed over, asking anxiously, "Harry, where's William?"

Harry's face was somber as he pointed to the operating room. "Mr. Scott is still in surgery."

Victoria felt her legs go weak, almost collapsing.

Luckily, Louie was quick to catch her.

"Surgery?" Victoria's tears flowed uncontrollably. She grabbed Harry's arm, her voice shaking. "Is he hurt? Where? How bad is it?"

Louie frowned, speaking softly, "Victoria, calm down."

"I can't calm down!" Victoria shouted at Harry. "Is William seriously hurt? Tell me the truth!"

Harry sighed. "A bullet went through his left abdomen. He needs surgery to remove it."

Victoria felt the world spin, nearly fainting.

Daisy, overhearing, felt like she had been struck by lightning. "It's all my fault. If something happens to William, how will I face my late brother and sister-in-law?"

She broke down, sobbing in Alvin's arms.

Alvin, his brow furrowed, struggled to find the right words to comfort her. After a long pause, he gently pressed her shoulder and sighed. "He took that bullet for me."

###chapter 178 They Are Taken Care of

Victoria's body shook as she stared at Alvin in disbelief. "Dad! What did you just say?"

Wasn't he the one who hated Alvin the most?

Why would he risk his life to take a bullet for him?

Had he lost his mind?

Victoria stood frozen for a moment before suddenly pushing Louie aside and sprinting towards the operating room.

The others quickly followed.

The red light above the operating room stayed on for three long hours before finally going out.

When the medical staff emerged, all eyes were fixed on them.

The doctor removed his mask, looking exhausted, and spoke at length. "The bullet pierced his abdomen, but luckily, it didn't hit any vital organs. However, an old wound in his abdomen tore open, causing excessive bleeding. He'll need to stay in the hospital for a while longer."

Hearing this, everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief.

The doctor then returned to the operating room to finish up.

Victoria's anxiety finally eased, and tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

Daisy hugged her shoulders, silently comforting her.

After crying for a while, Victoria suddenly thought of something. She looked up at Harry and asked suspiciously, "What old wound? When did he get hurt in the abdomen?"

"Well..." Harry stammered, avoiding her gaze.

It wasn't that he didn't want to tell her; William had strictly forbidden him from mentioning it to Victoria. Otherwise, his salary would be cut in half.

With a family to support, how could he survive with half his salary?

Seeing Harry's hesitation, Victoria was even more certain he was hiding something.

"Spit it out!" Victoria stomped her foot in frustration, urging him.

Daisy sighed, pulled her to sit down, and patiently explained, "William's injury was self-inflicted."

"What?" Victoria's eyes widened in horror as she looked at Daisy. "He stabbed himself? Is he out of his mind? Does he have a death wish?"

Seeing Victoria's anger, Daisy felt a pang of sadness.

She then explained how William had stabbed himself and paid three million dollars to repay Alice for saving his life and to completely break up with her.

After hearing Daisy's explanation, Victoria was silent for a long time, struggling to process the truth.

No wonder he had been so tolerant and loving towards Alice; it was because of this.

Victoria looked at the now darkened light above the operating room, feeling a mix of emotions.

"Is he an idiot?" Victoria muttered to herself.

'William, this time I owe you my life,' she thought.

Alvin was taken away by the police. The incident had caused too much commotion, and the proper procedures had to be followed.

Since he was still on parole and had used special channels to leave the country, Victoria was worried something might go wrong.

Louie stood up. "I'll go check on him."

He glanced towards the hospital room. "I promised him I'd get you all out safely."

"Thank you." Her response was dry, and she didn't even have the courage to ask what William had promised.

Daisy and Victoria waited in the hospital corridor all night. When the doctor finally came out to inform them that William was awake and could have visitors, Victoria hesitated.

She was afraid to see him.

He was the one who had sent Alvin to prison, who had humiliated and manipulated her, but now, he had risked his life to save Alvin.

She really didn't know how to face him.

Soon, Daisy came out and softly said, "Victoria, he wants to see you."

Victoria's heart tightened. She bit her lip and walked into the hospital room.

William lay weakly on the bed, his once handsome face was now as pale as a sheet, his lips colorless.

His abdomen was slightly raised, likely wrapped in thick bandages.

Hearing her enter, he turned his head with effort and gave her a weak smile. "If I hadn't asked you to come in, were you planning to just stand outside forever?"

Victoria had intended to stay composed in front of him, but as soon as she spoke, her voice cracked with emotion. "How did it come to this? Didn't I tell you to be extra careful?"

William looked at her deeply, remained silent for a moment, and then softly said, "I was careless."

He didn't mention taking the bullet for Alvin.

But Victoria felt a sharp pain in her heart.

Seeing her standing there motionless, William reached out his hand and beckoned her. "Come here."

Victoria fought back her tears, hesitated for a moment, and then slowly walked over to hold his hand.

William looked at her red eyes, which made him want to pull her into his arms.

They held hands, and for a moment, the atmosphere in the room became subtly intimate.

Victoria broke the silence first, asking softly, "Are The Iron Crocodiles taken care of?"

William half-closed his eyes, his usual sharpness gone, his face looking more vulnerable, evoking a protective instinct.

"Yes," he replied weakly, his fingers gently stroking her palm.

"What kind of deal did you and Louie make? Why is he helping us so much?" Victoria finally voiced the question that had been bothering her.

Hearing this, William squinted and gave a faint smile. "Afraid I sold you?"

Victoria glanced at him and muttered, "If you did, I'd rather find my own buyer."

It was meant as a joke, but William's face darkened, and he tightened his grip on her hand. "Don't you dare!"

"Why wouldn't I?" Victoria lowered her head, her voice even softer. "I owe you such a big favor, how can I ever repay it?"

"Who said you have to repay it?" William was annoyed, his tone impatient. "I got hurt because I wanted to, it has nothing to do with you."

Victoria frowned even more, blurting out, "Can you honestly say you didn't take that bullet for my dad because of me?"

William froze.

Then he turned his face away, muttering, "Don't flatter yourself. I told you it was an accident, I didn't take it for him."

No matter who got hurt, even if it was another family member, he wouldn't admit it.

Victoria regretted asking immediately, feeling incredibly awkward.

Even if she knew the truth, what did she expect William to say? That he did it for her?

Then what? She'd say thank you?

If that happened, even she would feel insincere.

Neither of them spoke again, and the room fell into silence.

"William!"

The door suddenly burst open.

###chapter 179 Why Are You Here?

It was Alice.

Without even glancing at Victoria, she rushed straight to William's bedside, her eyes red and her voice trembling with emotion. "How did this happen? I was so scared when I heard you got hurt!"

Victoria hadn't expected her to show up at this moment.

William frowned slightly, a hint of impatience in his eyes. "Why are you here?"

"I heard Ms. Scott was in trouble in Xandria, so I thought I'd come to help. My aunt has some pull here. But as soon as I got off the plane, I heard you were hurt." Alice spoke while looking at William with concern, her eyes brimming with tears.

It was only then that she noticed Victoria in the room. A flash of hostility crossed her eyes, but she didn't act on it. Instead, she greeted Victoria politely, "Ms. Carter."

Then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, she asked, "Could you get me a glass of water?"

Victoria almost nodded instinctively, but the words caught in her throat.

She quickly regained her composure and said softly, "The doctor specifically said William can't drink water right now."

"Oh, I see." Alice smiled apologetically at Victoria, then turned her full attention back to William. "Is the pillow height okay? Do you want me to adjust it? If there's anything else bothering you, let me know, and I'll call the doctor right away."

Alice's attentiveness made it seem like she and William were still a couple in love, even though their engagement had long been called off.

This made Victoria feel out of place.

Feeling awkward, Victoria said softly, "I'll step out for a bit."

Alice turned to her, smiling understandingly. "Sure, Ms. Carter. You go rest. I'll take care of things here."

Victoria was about to agree when William looked at her and said coldly, "Is this how you repay someone who saved your dad's life?"

Victoria was stunned. Just a moment ago, he had been stubbornly denying that he saved Alvin. How did he change his tune so quickly?

But she didn't get angry. After all, he had a point. She was indeed in the wrong.

So, she immediately stepped forward, her attitude becoming particularly attentive. "I won't leave. I'll stay and take care of you."

Alice lowered her eyes slightly, hiding her complex emotions.

Victoria didn't have time to guess what Alice was thinking. She said calmly, "Ms. Garcia, I'll stay here. You've come a long way and must be exhausted. You should go rest."

William, lying in bed, had a barely noticeable smile on his lips, seemingly satisfied with Victoria's response. He then closed his eyes, looking content.

Alice still wore a smile and replied softly, "Okay."

At that moment, she seemed particularly agreeable, completely different from her usual sharpness. Her gentle demeanor matched her appearance, surprising Victoria with the change.

***

Back at the hotel, Alice threw a fit.

Her aunt, Catherine Potts, had just returned from shopping and walked into the room to find Alice throwing things around.

Catherine raised an eyebrow, walking in slowly in her elegant high heels. "Now you're worried? I heard you were quite decisive when you agreed to call off the engagement, even more so than your sister."

Alice collapsed onto the sofa, covering her face with her hands, her voice choked with tears. "He stabbed himself to break off the engagement. What could I do? If I pushed him any further, I'd end up like Ella, completely despised by him. I just didn't want to burn all bridges, leaving myself some room."

Catherine removed her scarf and sat at the vanity to take off her earrings. "And what was the result? You can't be soft-hearted with men! You went through so much for him. You should have insisted on not breaking off the engagement, and if he pushed you, you could have threatened to jump off a building or slit your wrists. I don't believe he would have continued to confront you. You gave him freedom, and now look at you. You're not even his fiancée anymore, and you have to watch others' faces when you visit him."

Alice bit her lip, her eyes red as she looked up. "Aunt Catherine, what's the point of saying this now? It only makes me feel worse."

Catherine stood up, walked over, and patted her shoulder gently. "Alright, crying here won't help. You should think about how to get that Victoria away from him."

Alice took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down. "Aunt Catherine, I want to stay here for a while."

"Are you sure?" Catherine looked at her, her gaze scrutinizing. "I arranged for you to meet some outstanding young men. Don't you want to give them a chance? Maybe after meeting them, you'll forget about William. A smart woman doesn't stubbornly choose just one man."

Alice shook her head firmly. "In this life, my heart belongs only to him!"

Seeing Alice's determination, Catherine sighed softly. "Then you need to be clear-headed. You're already at a disadvantage."

"Not necessarily." Alice composed herself, lifting her head with a determined look in her eyes. "Maybe staying by his side as a friend will give me more opportunities."

Catherine didn't fully understand the deeper meaning of this, but she didn't interfere much in young people's romantic entanglements. She just reminded Alice, "Keep your priorities straight. I've heard rumors that your stepmother is secretly transferring assets. Be cautious."

Hearing this, Alice's expression turned thoughtful. After a moment, she smiled slightly. "Got it."

***

By midday, William was allowed to drink water and have some liquid food.

Victoria fed him some soup, but he couldn't drink much.

As the painkillers wore off, the burning sensation from his wound grew more intense.

The pain, though not lasting long, was sharp and relentless, making it hard to bear.

William kept his eyes tightly shut, his brows furrowed, and beads of sweat formed on his forehead, trickling down his face.

Victoria had already consulted the doctor and knew he was in agony from his wound.

Seeing him in such pain, she quickly ran to the bathroom, soaked a towel in warm water, and carefully wiped the sweat from his forehead.

William's eyelids fluttered, and he slowly opened his eyes, his gaze hazy as if looking through a mist.

"Are you tired?" His voice was dry and hoarse.

"I'm not tired." Victoria shook her head gently.

She walked quickly to the table, picked up a water jug, poured a glass of water, and inserted a straw, bringing it to his lips. "Drink some water to soothe your throat."

"I want to sit up." William tried to move, attempting to prop himself up.

"You can't! What if your wound opens up?" Victoria quickly reached out to stop him.

"I'm not that fragile." William gritted his teeth, his voice muffled, still trying to exert himself.

Seeing his determination, Victoria had no choice but to help.

She supported his back with one hand and pressed the button to raise the bed with the other.

Then she grabbed a pillow and placed it behind him to make him more comfortable.

William's mind cleared a bit, and he looked at Victoria's tired face, frowning again. "Come here."

"What?" Victoria was puzzled.

She obediently took a couple of steps closer to the bed.

William reached out, pulled her to his side, and moved over, making room on the bed. "Lie down and rest for a while."

###chapter 180 Stop Pretending to Be Strong

"No, no." Victoria waved her hands frantically, shaking her head. "I'll just crash on the couch once you fall asleep."

"You won't," William said, dead certain. He knew her too well.

She had no intention of sleeping. She was scared she'd sleep too deeply and miss any noise from his side. So, she planned to stay up all night.

"Get up here," William commanded, leaving no room for argument.

Victoria stubbornly shook her head, refusing to comply.

True to his usual forceful nature, William didn't waste time arguing. He reached out, grabbed her arm, and tried to pull her onto the bed.

"I really don't need to," Victoria struggled, accidentally tugging at his abdominal wound. William cried out in pain, his face contorting.

"Are you okay?" Victoria asked anxiously, her voice full of guilt.

William looked up at her weakly. "At a time like this, you're still gonna argue with me?"

Victoria bit her lip, hesitated for a moment, and then slowly sat down on the edge of the bed.

Seeing this, William extended his arm, pulled her into his embrace, and gently covered them both with the blanket. "Sleep," he said hoarsely.

Victoria lay there, her body tense, not daring to move for fear of hurting him again.

Her rare compliance made William smile faintly. He tightened his arm around her and slowly brought his lips to her forehead.

Victoria clutched the blanket tightly, her heart racing. She closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep.

The atmosphere between them was awkward yet intimate.

It wasn't just because she was Samuel's girlfriend. There were too many misunderstandings and conflicts between her and William. Getting together was easier said than done.

"Victoria," William suddenly spoke, his voice slow. "I didn't ask her to come."

Victoria was silent for a moment before responding softly, "Even if you did, what does it have to do with me?"

Feeling William's grip tighten, Victoria quickly said, "Don't move around."

William narrowed his eyes, his tone cold and a bit petulant. "Didn't you say it has nothing to do with you? Why do you care? If my wound opens and I die from the pain, it's my own fault."

"You!" Victoria turned her head angrily, glaring at him. "William, can you be a little more mature?"

"Don't you know if I'm mature or not?" William deliberately misinterpreted her words, pressing his hips forward.

If it weren't for his injury, Victoria would have kicked him off the bed. This guy didn't look like someone who had just come back from the brink of death.

Ignoring the risk of hurting him, she angrily turned her back to him, thinking to herself that no matter how careful she was, she couldn't stop him from acting recklessly. Clearly, he wasn't hurt badly enough if he still had the energy to mess around.

William, however, was relentless. He slowly moved closer and stubbornly pulled her back into his arms.

Victoria frowned impatiently. "Don't push yourself at a time like this."

William raised an eyebrow, grunted behind her, and without a word, pulled one of her hands under the blanket.

"You..." Victoria started, but her words were cut off when her fingers touched something warm and hard.

She jerked her hand back as if electrocuted, her face turning bright red. "William!"

William, sounding genuinely exhausted, rested his head on her back. "Don't overthink it. It's just a normal physiological reaction."

Victoria's face burned, even her ears felt like they were on fire.

As the room grew quiet, she assumed he had fallen asleep and let out a sigh of relief.

Little did she know, the deep eyes behind her were silently watching her, filled with intense and deep emotions.

***

In the morning, the doctor came to check on William.

He gently pushed open the door and saw William sitting by the bed.

William turned his head and made a shushing gesture to the doctor.

Victoria was still sound asleep.

The doctor understood and couldn't help but smile, whispering, "It's rare to see such a considerate husband these days."

William lowered his eyes slightly, not bothering to explain his relationship with Victoria.

The doctor did a quick check-up and was amazed at William's rapid recovery. At this rate, he could be discharged in less than a week.

As soon as the doctor left, the phone on the bedside table lit up. Victoria had set it to silent, and the screen showed "Samuel."

William glanced at it, raised an eyebrow, and casually answered the call, his tone lazy. "Who is this?"

The other end of the line went silent.

William's lips curled into a satisfied smile. "Looking for Victoria?"

He could hear the deep breath on the other end before Samuel, trying to stay calm, said, "Let me speak to Victoria."

Samuel skipped the pleasantries, clearly recognizing William's voice.

William glanced at the sleeping Victoria and said truthfully, "She's still asleep."

The words hit Samuel like a bomb.

Samuel's grip on his pen tightened until it snapped in two.

"William!" Samuel said through gritted teeth. "She's my girlfriend!"

William held the phone, a mocking smile on his face. "So what? I don't care about that. She's always been my woman."

Samuel, struggling to control his anger, said coldly, "William, don't you think your methods are despicable? You had people cause trouble for me in Silvermist City just to keep me away from her, didn't you?"

"Yes," William admitted openly, not hiding his devious intentions.

Samuel, using all his willpower to stay calm, said, "Aren't you afraid I'll tell Victoria what you've done?"

William laughed dismissively. "Do you have any proof?"

"You!" Samuel growled.

Before Samuel could say more, William hung up the phone without hesitation.

When the phone rang again, he simply turned it over and placed it face down on the table.

Victoria slept deeply, having been anxious and sleepless for days.

When she woke up, she instinctively reached for the spot next to her.

"William!"

Finding it empty, she sat up quickly, threw off the blanket, and got out of bed barefoot.

"William?" She hurriedly checked the bathroom, but it was empty too.

"William! Where are you?"

She was about to rush out the door when it opened from the outside, and she ran straight into a warm embrace. 

###chapter 181 Defending Him

William instinctively reached out to protect her forehead, worried she might hurt herself.

Victoria looked up at him, the panic on her face quickly fading. "Where'd you go? I woke up and you weren't here."

Before William could respond, the young nurse behind him covered her mouth and giggled. "You two must be newlyweds, huh? Can't stand being apart for even a second?"

Victoria, still groggy from sleep, took a moment to process the nurse's teasing and stammered out a denial.

William's handsome face held a faint smile. "Don't tease her, she's easily embarrassed."

The nurse giggled again, clearly excited, as she helped William into the room. While changing his bandages, she whispered to Victoria, "Your husband is so good to you. This morning, when we took him for tests, he wouldn't let us wake you."

Victoria's face turned bright red.

She was supposed to be the one taking care of him, yet she had slept so soundly.

Overwhelmed with guilt, she didn't even try to explain their relationship.

William leaned back on the hospital bed, his eyes filled with a gentle smile as he looked at Victoria.

Once the nurse left the room, he reached out his hand and softly said, "Come here."

Victoria looked at him warily, refusing to move.

"Alright," William said, a barely-there smile playing on his lips. "Then I'll come to you."

"No, don't!" Victoria exclaimed, worried he might aggravate his injury. She quickly stepped forward. "Just tell me what you need, and I'll help you."

William, still in the motion of getting out of bed, looked up at her with a probing gaze. "Really?"

"Yes," Victoria nodded firmly, her guilt driving her to make up for falling asleep last night.

William's thick eyelashes fluttered slightly before he raised his arm and gently placed it on her shoulder, pulling her into an embrace. His voice was low and tender. "I just want to hold you for a while, nothing else."

Victoria was caught off guard by his sudden hug, her hands instinctively bracing against the bed to avoid pressing on his abdominal wound.

"Let me hold you for a bit," he whispered in her ear, a hint of sadness in his voice. "Let me know you're still here."

Victoria lowered her eyes, her emotions a mix of feelings she couldn't quite name, her heart swelling with a touch of bitterness.

"William!"

The door suddenly burst open, and Daisy walked in briskly.

Seeing the scene inside, she turned to leave, "We can talk later..."

But before she could finish, someone roughly pushed her aside.

Alvin stormed into the room, his face dark. William, however, remained calm, his gaze indifferent as if he wasn't holding Victoria in his arms.

Victoria, startled by the commotion, quickly turned her head.

"Dad!" She looked like a child caught doing something wrong, standing up abruptly and stammering.

William's hand suddenly grasped hers, and she looked at him, confused.

He smiled gently, signaling her to stay calm.

Alvin, seeing this, was so furious he nearly fainted. He glared at Victoria and barked, "Victoria! Go back to the hotel now!"

He grabbed her hand, trying to drag her out.

William frowned, attempting to stand but wincing in pain.

Victoria, worried, shook off Alvin's hand and looked at William anxiously. "William, don't move."

"Relax," William said, trying to comfort her despite the pain. "It's okay, you should go back to the hotel. I'll be fine on my own."

Victoria couldn't bring herself to leave, especially with William so badly injured. What if they had a conflict?

After all, William got hurt helping her and saving Alvin. She couldn't just leave him.

Determined, Victoria looked at Alvin and said loudly, "Dad, he's hurt. You can't mess with him."

Alvin was stunned, looking at Victoria in disbelief. "You're defending him?"

And why did she assume he would mess with an injured man?

Behind Victoria, William's eyes narrowed slightly, a smug smile on his face, like a cat that got the cream.

Daisy's expression wasn't much better. Couldn't William be a bit more restrained?

"I'm not defending him, just stating the facts," Victoria insisted, standing firmly in front of Alvin, arms outstretched to block him from William. "Dad, can't this wait until he's healed?"

William coughed weakly, looking extremely frail but trying to appear nonchalant. "Victoria, I'm fine. You're tired, go rest. I can manage."

The more he acted like this, the more Victoria refused to move, determined to protect him.

Daisy, meanwhile, kept her eyes on Alvin. She probably just came to check if William was okay.

Victoria certainly didn't trust Daisy to take care of William.

Seeing William's act, Daisy twitched her eyebrow. She couldn't believe this was her usually aloof nephew.

And Victoria, so determined to protect him, made Daisy shake her head. He could only fool someone as naive as Victoria.

But looking at Alvin, things seemed dire.

Alvin's face was livid, clearly on the verge of exploding.

The angrier he got, the more Victoria refused to leave him alone with William.

"Dad, whatever you need to say, can it wait until he's better? If you want to scold him, do it when he's healed," Victoria said, standing her ground. "He needs to rest."

Alvin's eyes widened in disbelief. "What did you say?"

Victoria pressed her lips together and shook her head firmly. "I said, no one can touch him today!"

"Victoria!" Alvin's voice grew harsher. "Are you rebelling?"

"No..."

Victoria wanted to explain, but Daisy quickly intervened, smiling to ease the tension. "Then please take care of William. We'll go."

She reached for Alvin, who stood still, and glared at him. "Are you coming or not?"

###chapter 182 Ex-Fiancée

Alvin clenched his jaw, shot William a furious look, and stormed off.

William smirked, unfazed. He was always tough and never backed down from a challenge.

Then, he turned to Victoria, his gaze softening instantly.

Victoria stood there, stunned, watching Alvin leave in a huff, feeling a bit lost.

She mumbled to herself, "This is bad. Looks like I really made Dad mad this time."

William, however, thought to himself, 'So what if he's mad? Worst case, you won't go back home, and I'll take care of you!'

But he was smart enough to know that saying this out loud would definitely cause a rift between them.

Just then, the doctor walked in with more medication for William.

Victoria quickly composed herself and moved to the bedside.

"You didn't sleep well last night. Get some rest now, I'll stay here with you," she said softly.

William didn't argue, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Alright, I didn't sleep well holding you last night anyway."

"You!" Victoria's face turned red as she glared at him. "Stop talking nonsense!"

"Isn't it true?" William teased, his eyes twinkling. "You were clinging to me pretty tightly while you slept."

"Get lost!" Victoria snapped, embarrassed. "William, can you be serious for once?"

She had never realized he could be so shameless!

"Okay," William agreed readily, though his deep, starry eyes still sparkled with mischief.

William slept deeply, even after three IV bags had been administered. He still hadn't woken up.

Victoria asked a nurse to keep an eye on him while she went out to get lunch.

When she returned, she ran into Louie at the door of the hospital room.

"Louie?"

Louie was there with Hayden, and Paxton was carrying a basket of fresh fruit.

It was quite a surprise to see him visiting.

Louie was dressed in a gray suit today, his shirt collar open, revealing his attractive collarbone and Adam's apple.

He looked quite dashing, though a bit flashy.

Louie smiled slightly at her and naturally took the food from her hands.

"No need, I can carry it myself. It's no trouble," Victoria instinctively protested.

"Let's go in," Louie said, taking the food and handing it to Paxton, then confidently leading the way.

Victoria followed him.

Before they even opened the door, they heard a woman's exaggerated voice from inside.

"How can you not have eaten yet? Is this how she take care of you? William, I'm here, you could have just called me! Ms. Carter is young and inexperienced, how can you rely on her?"

Victoria frowned.

Louie glanced back at her.

Recognizing Alice's voice, Victoria shrugged helplessly and whispered, "His ex-fiancée."

Louie raised an eyebrow, understanding.

He then looked at Victoria with interest. "You two have quite the complicated relationship. You have a boyfriend, and he has an ex-fiancée."

Victoria felt a bit embarrassed.

"Why aren't you coming in?" William's voice called from inside.

Louie turned back, a meaningful smile on his lips.

He then pushed the door open and walked in. "Mr. Scott, I'm here to collect on your promise."

Victoria followed him into the room, nodding politely at Alice. "Ms. Garcia."

Paxton placed the fruit basket and food gently on the table and then stepped back quietly.

Alice glanced at the food on the table, frowning slightly, her tone a bit reproachful. "Ms. Carter, William is a patient. Are you planning to feed him this junk food?"

Victoria knew it wasn't ideal. She smiled awkwardly and explained, "I've been at the hospital all night and didn't have time to go back and make a nutritious meal. Plus, the hotel I'm staying at isn't very convenient."

Alice laughed softly, though her smile carried an unclear meaning. "It's alright. Luckily, I brought some soup."

She quickly served the soup from a thermos. "Ms. Carter, you've been here all night. You must be exhausted. Why don't you go rest? I'll take over."

Victoria was actually tempted.

William shot her a look and casually asked, "Are you tired?"

Feeling guilty under his gaze, Victoria quickly shook her head. "Not tired."

Alice's hand paused slightly, but she maintained her gentle smile. "William, have some soup."

Louie, sitting on the sofa, watched the scene unfold with quiet amusement.

William glanced at the bowl of soup. Alice said softly, "This soup is very nutritious. I borrowed the hotel's kitchen early this morning to make it. Even though staying at a hotel is inconvenient, I just cared about you, so nothing felt too difficult."

Louie found it interesting and looked at Victoria with a knowing smile.

Victoria finally caught on. Alice was subtly implying that she didn't care enough.

William held the bowl of soup but didn't drink it. He looked up at Victoria. "Come here."

Victoria walked over, puzzled. "What is it?"

Without a word, he pushed the bowl of soup towards her. "Drink it."

Victoria was taken aback and instinctively stepped back. "This is for you, from Ms. Garcia. It's not right for me to drink it. Besides, I'm not the one who needs to recover."

Alice's smile instantly turned cold. She moved to a spot where William couldn't see her and glared at Victoria.

Under her glare, Victoria didn't dare drink it.

Besides, she genuinely thought William was being unreasonable.

No matter what, it was a kind gesture from Alice.

Even if he didn't accept it, he shouldn't waste trash her kindness like that.

"Who says you don't need it?" William said slowly, his tone teasing. "You were more exhausted than I was last night."

That one sentence made the atmosphere even more tense.

Victoria glared at William, her eyes full of warning, signaling him to stop talking nonsense.

Alice's fingers dug into her palm. In the past, she would have stormed out in anger.

But now, as his ex-girlfriend, she knew she couldn't overreact.

So, she suppressed her anger and bitterness, forcing a smile. "Ms. Carter, William cares about you. Just drink it. I'll make more for him later."

At that moment, Louie stood up leisurely and said, "I can tell from the smell that Ms. Garcia is a great cook."

He picked up the bowl of soup and smiled at Alice. "Mind if I try it, Ms. Garcia?"

###chapter 183 I Am a Jerk

With that, he tilted his head back and downed the soup in one gulp.

"Not bad at all," Louie said, setting the bowl down and casting a quick glance at William.

William returned the look with a brief, indifferent glance.

Then, William turned to Alice. "You should head back now."

Alice bit her lower lip, forcing a polite smile. "Alright, take care."

Once she left the room, Victoria couldn't hold back any longer. "Weren't you a bit too harsh on her? She was just trying to be nice."

William's gaze turned colder, tinged with impatience. "You know what she's after, don't you?"

"That's exactly why I think you were wrong."

"So, you think I should accept her kindness, knowing she still has feelings for me, and let her keep hoping? What kind of behavior is that?" William raised an eyebrow, his tone dripping with sarcasm.

Victoria was momentarily speechless, unsure how to respond.

Louie chimed in from the side, "It's just typical scumbag behavior."

William's lips curled into a half-smile. "See? Sometimes, you women are just impossible to please."

Victoria's chest heaved with anger, but she couldn't find the words to retort. She turned to Louie, her tone now cold and distant, a stark contrast to her earlier warmth when she called him "Mr. Hopper."

"When did you two become so in sync? Whatever, I guess I'm the third wheel here. I'll go find the doctor."

With that, she stormed out of the room.

Louie watched her leave, chuckling softly. "Lucky you, having two beautiful women interested in you."

William raised an eyebrow, giving him a wry smile. "Want that luck?"

"No thanks, I couldn't handle it." Louie sat back down, his expression turning serious. "Alvin's situation is under control. He can leave anytime."

William straightened up slightly, a hint of admiration in his eyes. "I trust you to get things done. You're efficient."

"Cut the crap. Now it's your turn to keep your promise," Louie said, his gaze intense.

"Don't worry," William said with a smirk. "I promised to take down The Iron Crocodiles and unify Xandria's underground. I'll make it happen."

Louie nodded, then added, "One more thing."

"Go on," William said nonchalantly.

"My people found out that some of the guys who kidnapped Alvin and attacked you came from Crystalia," Louie said, his eyes narrowing with a dangerous glint. "You should be careful."

William lowered his gaze, hiding the sharpness in his eyes.

William's recovery was swift. In just four days, he was up and moving around as if nothing had happened.

Victoria stayed by his side the whole time, looking surprisingly refreshed rather than exhausted. William had Harry bring in local delicacies every day and even arranged a comfortable bed for her, which had resulted in her gaining a bit of weight.

That afternoon, Alvin called, giving a final ultimatum. He had booked a flight for the next morning and wanted Victoria to leave with him.

After hanging up, Victoria looked at William, hesitating before speaking softly. "William, my dad booked a flight for tomorrow morning. He wants me to go with him."

William was working on his phone, but his movements froze, and his expression darkened.

He gripped his phone tightly, finally forcing out a few words through gritted teeth. "What's the rush?"

Victoria lowered her eyes, explaining quietly, "I've been away for a while. I need to get back to work and prepare for the University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam."

"Can't you prepare for the exam here?" William scoffed, slamming his phone onto the table. "He's doing this on purpose, just to keep you away from me!"

William spent the rest of the afternoon in a foul mood, barely responding to anyone who tried to talk to him.

That evening, when Harry brought dinner, William didn't even glance at it. He walked straight to the window, staring outside, not touching a single bite.

Victoria was worried and frustrated. She approached William, speaking softly. "You should eat something. You're not fully recovered yet."

William whipped around, his eyes blazing with anger. "Eat? How can I eat when he's taking you away, and you're just going along with it?"

Victoria was getting angry too. She bit her lip. "It's my dad's decision. What can I do?"

"Can't you stand up to him?" William's voice rose. "Do you even care about me?"

"Stop being unreasonable!" Victoria stomped her foot, turning away from him, not wanting to argue anymore.

The tension between them lasted into the night, the atmosphere in the room suffocating.

In the middle of the night, William suddenly cried out in pain.

Victoria, who was a light sleeper, woke up immediately and sat up in a panic. "What's wrong?"

William clutched his wound, his face contorted in pain. "I think it reopened."

Victoria hurriedly turned on the light and leaned in to check.

In that moment, William grabbed her and pulled her into the bed, pressing his head against her shoulder.

"Victoria, I'm sorry," William's voice was hoarse. "I just can't stand the thought of you leaving. It kills me to think you'll be gone tomorrow and belong to someone else."

Victoria's body trembled. She opened her mouth but couldn't find the words to say.

There were too many issues between them-family, past entanglements-all weighing her down like a ton of bricks.

Seeing her silence, William's heart ached. He sat up, cupping her face and kissing her.

Victoria was startled, instinctively wanting to push him away, but afraid of hurting his wound. She struggled slightly, then stopped.

William, seeing no resistance, deepened the kiss, his hand moving to her waist and slowly sliding upward.

Victoria felt his touch, her heart pounding in her chest.

"William!" she finally cried out. "Are you crazy? You're still injured!"

"I'm crazy," William's voice was husky and seductive. "Crazy at the thought of losing you."

His breathing grew heavier, his body pressing against hers.

Victoria, pinned beneath him, couldn't muster the strength to push him away.

William's hand slipped under her shirt, his rough fingers caressing her smooth skin, sending shivers through her.

Victoria, both embarrassed and angry, glared at him. "William! You jerk!"

He chuckled lowly. "I'm a jerk who wants to kiss you and make love to you."

###chapter 184 Had to Go Through with it

Victoria's face turned bright red as she snapped, "Get out of here!"

Instead of stopping, he only got more intense, using his knee to part her legs.

Victoria's body was on fire, overwhelmed with shame.

William leaned in, taking her earlobe into his mouth, his tongue teasing her sensitive neck, making her shiver uncontrollably.

Unable to hold back, Victoria let out a soft, seductive moan, "William, cut it out."

He buried his face in her neck, gently nibbling, "I heard you moan just now."

Victoria's cheeks were bright red as she bit her lower lip hard, trying to keep any sound from escaping, knowing she couldn't face William otherwise.

She knew he must be feeling very smug at this moment.

William continued to lightly suck on her smooth, delicate skin, leaving a trail of warm, intimate marks. As he teased her, he kept asking, "You like me, don't you?"

Victoria remained silent, desperately trying to suppress herself.

Suddenly, he lifted his head, pressing his forehead against hers, his voice low and tender, "Tell me, do you like me?"

She shook her head, lips tightly pressed together.

William's hand slipped under her shirt, kneading her soft breast through the thin fabric.

She had gained some weight recently, shedding her previously thin frame. Her already ample chest had become even fuller, feeling better than ever in his hands.

As she struggled, the buttons on her shirt popped open, exposing her rosy nipples to the air, an irresistible sight that made William's breathing grow heavier.

"Good girl," he murmured, holding her shoulders down. He then cupped her breasts, taking one nipple into his mouth, licking and tasting it.

Victoria's body went limp, and she was unable to push him away. She gave up struggling, letting him do as he pleased.

William's fingers trailed down her flat, firm stomach, moving lower.

His breath grew hotter, his voice hoarse, "Tell me, do you like me?"

His voice was so enticing that Victoria lost all reason, finally whispering, "Yes."

William smiled, his long fingers slipping under her skirt, shamelessly teasing her.

Victoria couldn't help but moan, her face flushed.

His fingers skillfully played with her most sensitive spot.

At the intimate touch, Victoria found her eyes welling up with tears, her long lashes damp, making her look both pitiful and alluring.

Her beautiful face was now tinged with an unnatural flush, her eyes filled with a seductive hue.

"William, don't touch there, it tickles."

William didn't stop. He bit her earlobe, whispering, "Where? Let me check."

"No," Victoria protested with a sob, but her body betrayed her, legs straightening and hands clinging to William's neck.

William ignored her protests. Once he had stretched her enough, he quickly undressed, revealing his painfully hard erection, rubbing it against her wet entrance.

Just then, there was a knock on the door, followed by the concerned voice of the night nurse, "Mr. Scott, I heard some noise from your room. Are you okay? Do you need help?"

Victoria was startled, trying to push William away, but he held her firmly, not letting go.

"Just had a little argument with my girlfriend. Everything's fine now. You can go back to your station," William replied hoarsely.

"Alright," the nurse responded, her footsteps fading away.

Victoria was about to breathe a sigh of relief when William took advantage of her moment of relaxation, thrusting into her hard.

Both of them groaned, the intense pleasure making their heads spin.

Victoria clung to the bedsheets, her insides being ruthlessly pounded, her sensitive flesh rubbed mercilessly by his hard length. Her G-spot was hit repeatedly, making her forget her earlier coldness, now only able to cry out for him to be gentler.

Her reactions only encouraged William further.

Seeing Victoria's desperate expression, William leaned down, holding her trembling body, planting small kisses on her beautifully shaped shoulder blades and rounded shoulders.

Victoria whimpered, her legs tightly wrapped around his lean waist, her hips twisting to escape the overwhelming pleasure.

Their bodies were tightly connected, and she could feel his hard length relentlessly thrusting inside her.

Victoria was exhausted, her mind blank.

Ignoring the pain from his abdominal wound, William straightened up, gripping Victoria's slim waist, thrusting in and out rapidly, his large head repeatedly hitting her G-spot, making her entrance swell.

After dozens of fierce thrusts, William finally reached his climax, the hot liquid making Victoria's body shudder, sending her into a powerful orgasm.

Victoria collapsed, completely drained.

She closed her eyes, her body still trembling slightly.

William's large hand remained on her chest, his fingers tracing her rosy nipples.

"Get off me!" Victoria panted, using the last of her strength to weakly push William away.

William grunted, his forehead covered in sweat.

It was then that Victoria noticed the blood seeping through the bandage on his abdomen, clearly indicating his wound had reopened.

Panic set in as she hurriedly tried to help him up, "William, are you okay?"

William propped himself up, his gaze deep, his voice raspy, "What do you think?"

Victoria gritted her teeth, snapping, "You just had to go through with it!"

"It's your fault," he said, looking at the hickeys on her body, his Adam's apple bobbing, "I get so turned on just seeing you."

Victoria blushed furiously at his shameless words, unable to respond.

William stared at her flushed cheeks for a moment before leaning down to kiss her lips.

"Baby," he called softly, each syllable like a feather brushing against Victoria's nerves, making her body go weak and her heart race.

"Let go," Victoria turned her head away, "I need to clean up and get the doctor to re-bandage you."

With that, she got out of bed, quickly cleaned herself up in the bathroom, changed into a fresh nightgown, and opened the window to air out the room.

She then returned to the bed, tidied up, and cleaned away any traces of their activities.

Finally, she dressed William and pressed the call button.

William leaned back against the bed, watching Victoria's busy figure, feeling a strange flutter in his heart.

###chapter 185 Are You Really Leaving?

Soon, the doctor and nurses rushed in.

The doctor approached with a serious expression, carefully removing the bandage from William's wound to check the situation.

Victoria stood nearby, her eyes fixed on the doctor's every move.

"The wound's opened up a bit, but it's not too bad. We just need to clean it and rebandage," the doctor said, easing some of Victoria's worry.

The nurses quickly prepared the necessary medical tools and supplies, and the doctor began to meticulously clean and stitch up William's wound.

William remained silent, not even flinching, as if he couldn't feel the pain.

After finishing, the doctor advised, "He needs to stay calm for the next few days. His body is still recovering, so he must rest and avoid any further injuries."

Turning to Victoria, the doctor added, "You've been taking good care of him, but make sure he doesn't have any more issues tonight."

Victoria nodded repeatedly. After the doctor and nurses left, she slowly sat by the bed, her head lowered, avoiding William's gaze.

"Victoria," William called softly, reaching out to hold her hand, but she instinctively pulled away.

"Don't move. Just lie down and rest," Victoria's voice carried a hint of distance. She knew that all this chaos stemmed from their complicated and entangled feelings.

She couldn't let go of her concern for William, yet she couldn't go against Alvin's wishes. She felt utterly exhausted.

William felt a pang of sadness as she pulled away. He was about to say something when he saw Victoria stand up and walk to the window, turning her back to him.

"Victoria, I just don't want you to leave," William broke the silence, his voice low and hoarse.

Victoria's shoulders trembled slightly. She took a deep breath, trying to calm her emotions. "William, don't say anything more. Just focus on getting better."

They fell into a long silence, the quiet room filled only with their breaths.

Victoria suddenly felt suffocated.

After a long while, she spoke, "William, you know that no matter how long we stay here, we eventually have to go back."

Once they returned, their problems would once again loom between them.

Unless Alvin wasn't the one responsible for his parents' deaths, the rift between them would never change.

William's face darkened at her words.

They remained in a standoff for a long time. Just as Victoria was about to turn off the lights and go to bed, William's slightly hoarse voice came from behind her.

"If I said..."

Victoria turned to look at him.

William gazed deeply into her eyes, his lips parting slightly, but he swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue.

He knew that once some things were said, it would be like opening Pandora's box, impossible to close again.

He feared adding more pressure on Victoria and was even more afraid that the unresolved truth would shatter the remaining warmth between them.

After a long pause, he finally looked away, staring at the ceiling, his voice barely a whisper, "Nothing, go to sleep."

Victoria sensed something was off, a wave of unease washing over her.

That night, though they were in the same room, it felt like an invisible chasm separated them, each lost in their own thoughts, unable to sleep.

The next morning, Victoria got up early, quickly freshened up, and began packing her things.

William pretended to be asleep, secretly watching her busy figure, his heart a mix of emotions.

When Victoria zipped up her suitcase, he slowly sat up, his voice raspy, "Are you really leaving?"

Victoria paused, not turning around, and replied softly, "Yeah, my dad's waiting for me."

William forced a smile, hiding his sorrow, "Have a safe trip."

Victoria bit her lip, dragging her suitcase as she left the hospital.

When Daisy entered the room, William was standing by the window, his silhouette looking thin yet still proud, exuding a sense of aloofness.

His eyes were cold, watching the figure below gradually disappear.

"Stop looking. For Alvin, having Victoria stay here for so many days was already pushing it," Daisy said softly.

William frowned, turning to her with a hint of displeasure, "What did he do to win you over?"

Daisy scoffed, her face full of disdain, "If you weren't my nephew, I wouldn't have supported Victoria seeing you. I'm ashamed of what you did to her before!"

William's face grew darker, gritting his teeth, "I regret saving him."

"You saved Victoria's biological father. As long as that blood tie exists, you have no choice!" Daisy's voice carried a hint of helplessness.

William understood her point, his brow furrowed, feeling frustrated.

After a moment, he turned to Daisy, "Aunt Daisy, what do you think of Uncle Wayne?"

Daisy raised an eyebrow, surprised by the question. "Why are you asking about him all of a sudden?"

William didn't answer, pressing on, "What do you think of Uncle Wayne?"

Daisy thought for a moment, then said, "The head of Infinity Unity Group, highly capable, shrewd, and efficient." She paused, looking at William with a half-smile, "Why are you asking? Are you planning to take over Infinity Unity Group?"

William hesitated, then said, "Aunt Daisy, I suspect Uncle Wayne is connected to my parents' deaths."

Daisy's eyes widened in shock, "You suspect Wayne?"

William pressed his lips together, not responding.

Daisy sighed, "Actually, there are some things I shouldn't tell you..."

***

Alvin remained silent throughout the journey, walking a short distance ahead of Victoria as they left the airport.

Victoria felt a sense of helplessness. She knew exactly why Alvin was upset.

Alvin rarely got angry with Victoria, especially after his release from prison. He had been trying to make up for lost time, treating her with utmost care.

But anything involving William seemed to hit a nerve.

"Dad, are you still mad at me?" Victoria asked cautiously, her delicate face falling, showing a mix of guilt and a desire to please.

Alvin stopped, turning to look at her, his eyes filled with guilt and affection. He interrupted her, "It's not your fault. It's all my fault."

In the end, the root of the problem lay with him. How could Victoria be to blame?

"Dad, don't say that. There's really nothing between us anymore. We've completely broken up."

Her voice grew softer towards the end. She really didn't want to discuss this in front of Alvin.

"That's good." Alvin felt a deep sense of guilt and didn't say more, just sighed quietly.

Before leaving the airport, Victoria mustered the courage to send William a message.

###chapter 186 Bringing Girlfriend Home

Alvin trailed behind, lugging their bags as they slowly made their way out of the airport terminal.

"Victoria!" Samuel called out from the arrivals gate, holding a big bouquet of champagne roses, standing tall and confident.

He was dressed in a gray shirt and casual pants, with gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. His chiseled face wore a gentle smile, giving him a refined and handsome look.

Women passing by couldn't help but glance over, their eyes filled with envy and jealousy, wishing they could trade places with Victoria and be the girl receiving such affection.

"Samuel?" Victoria was surprised, quickly walking up to him. "What are you doing here?"

Samuel stepped forward, taking over the luggage cart with a gentlemanly smile. "Of course, I'm here to pick up my girlfriend and bring her home."

He then turned to Alvin. "Mr. Carter, hello. I'm Samuel. Victoria has mentioned you often, and it's a pleasure to finally meet you."

He gave a slight bow, polite and humble.

Alvin sized up Samuel, noting his well-mannered behavior, and a hint of approval flashed in his eyes. He nodded slightly. "Hello, thank you for coming."

It was clear that Alvin had a favorable impression of Samuel, a stark contrast to his attitude towards William.

"Mr. Carter, this is what I should do," Samuel said, then looked at Victoria with a soft smile. "You must be exhausted from the trip, right?"

Seeing his attentive demeanor, Victoria felt a pang of bitterness in her heart.

After a brief hesitation, she reached out and linked her arm with Samuel's, resting her head lightly on his shoulder.

To onlookers, they appeared to be a sweet couple reunited after a long separation.

Alvin looked on, satisfied.

Samuel's handsome face showed a moment of surprise, quickly replaced by joy. His gaze at Victoria was so intense it seemed to melt her, and he couldn't help but smile. Leaning close, he whispered in her ear, "Did you miss me?"

Victoria's cheeks flushed, and she gave him a playful glare, signaling with her eyes that Alvin was still nearby.

"Alright, alright, we'll talk later," Samuel said, his warm breath tickling her ear, making her blush even more.

Samuel then turned to Alvin. "Mr. Carter, I've booked a restaurant to welcome you and Victoria. Would that be convenient for you?"

Alvin glanced at Victoria, seeing no objection in her eyes, and agreed. "That sounds good. Thank you."

During the drive, Samuel drove smoothly while Victoria sat in the passenger seat, gazing out the window, her thoughts wandering.

She occasionally stole glances at Samuel and then at Alvin, her emotions a mix of confusion and unease.

At the restaurant, Samuel had arranged a private room with an elegant and quiet ambiance.

Alvin looked around, clearly pleased.

The three of them sat down, and the waiter poured water and served appetizers.

Samuel handed the menu to Alvin. "Mr. Carter, please choose something you like."

Alvin skimmed through the menu briefly and then handed it back. "You can order. I'm not picky."

Samuel smiled and turned to Victoria. "Victoria, why don't you pick a few of your favorites?"

His eyes were full of affection, making Victoria's cheeks flush slightly.

While waiting for the food, Alvin asked, "Samuel, what do you do?"

Samuel sat up straight and answered seriously, "Mr. Carter, I'm a professor at the University of Aesthetics Shine. My parents are businesspeople, and their ventures are doing quite well."

Victoria found Samuel's serious demeanor amusing, having never seen him so formal before.

But then, thinking about the reason behind his behavior and her complicated history with William, her heart sank. 

Lowering her eyes to hide her emotions, she felt guilt and a bit distressed.

Noticing this, Samuel gently took her hand under the table and asked softly, "What's wrong? Are you tired?"

Victoria, holding his hand, kept her head down, avoiding his gaze. "Yeah, a bit tired, but I'm fine."

Hearing this, Samuel immediately asked the waiter to hurry with the food and then comforted her. "Hang in there. Have a little something to eat, and I'll take you home to rest soon."

Victoria nodded slightly, obediently picking up some vegetables and eating slowly.

Seeing Samuel's attentive care for Victoria, Alvin felt both relieved and a bit sad.

He was relieved that Victoria had found a man worthy of her, someone who seemed upright and wouldn't mistreat her, far better than William.

He just hoped Victoria could truly move on from William and start anew.

By the end of the meal, Alvin's impression of Samuel had improved even more. Despite being several years older than Victoria, Samuel was maturity, thoughtfulness, and attentiveness, which made Alvin believe that this young man might provide Victoria with a stable future.

***

After listening to Daisy, William finally understood that Wayne's mother wasn't his grandmother.

She was Garth's secretary when he was young.

After a party, the secretary drugged Garth, slept with him, and became pregnant with Wayne.

She died from severe bleeding during childbirth.

William's grandmother, being kind-hearted, took in the innocent child and raised Wayne as her own.

Because it involved the elders' privacy, William had never known.

Even Daisy only found out from her mother before she passed away.

"Did my parents know?" William asked, frowning, his eyes deep and unreadable.

"Your parents probably didn't know. Your grandmother fell ill and passed away after they died," Daisy replied.

William pressed his lips together, silent for a long time.

He couldn't imagine that his grandmother and Garth, who had been in love for most of their lives, had such a betrayal and a secret child.

Daisy, seeing his conflicted expression, cautiously asked, "William, why do you suspect Wayne?"

William narrowed his eyes, his face cold and stern.

"I'll find out," he said indifferently, his deep eyes flashing with a chilling light.

"What are you going to do?" Daisy pressed.

William's expression hardened. "I have my ways."

"William," Daisy hesitated, then sighed and shook her head. "Wayne isn't easy to deal with. Be careful."

Just as William was about to respond, his phone rang with a special ringtone. It was a message from Victoria-she had landed.

At the same time, the bodyguard protecting her sent photos of Victoria and Samuel embracing at the airport.

His gaze darkened instantly, his grip on the phone tightening, his knuckles turning white.

The next moment, he threw the phone onto the table beside the hospital bed, standing up abruptly and growling in frustration, "I'm going back."

###chapter 187 Please Forgive Me

Daisy noticed it too, pausing her movements and glancing up at him. "You're not fully healed yet. Why go back? To watch her cozy up to Samuel?"

William's brow furrowed, his face full of disdain and resistance. "You don't get it."

Daisy scoffed dismissively. "You're just banking on the fact that she still has feelings for you. William, you need to understand something: once you hurt someone, even if you make amends, the scars remain."

William's lips pressed into a thin line, his gaze becoming inscrutable. "Even if there are scars, over time, they fade."

Daisy gave a sigh of resignation. "Fine, do whatever you want. I'm done trying to talk sense into you."

William completed his discharge paperwork, and Harry had already booked the earliest flight.

Before they left, Louie had specially sent Paxton to see them off. Such treatment from the renowned Louie was a rare honor.

Daisy couldn't help but look over, curiosity piqued. "What did you promise him? You're not getting involved in some illegal deal, are you?"

William gave her a helpless look, half-amused, half-exasperated. "What are you thinking? I don't do illegal stuff. We just reached a business strategic partnership. He provides the funding, I provide the plans and manpower. After we take down The Iron Crocodiles, I'll help him rebrand his image positively, and we'll start a company together."

Once successful, Louie would no longer be an underground kingpin but a respected businessman.

As for William, this would expand his business empire, a win-win situation.

So, despite the ups and downs of this trip to Xandria, it was quite fruitful.

The two arrived at the airport, the waiting area bustling with people in a hurry.

As they walked, William suddenly stopped, his gaze fixed.

Not far away, a familiar figure came into view-it was Alice.

***

After dinner, Samuel drove Victoria and Alvin back to their neighborhood.

As soon as the car stopped, Samuel seemed to remember something and quickly said to Victoria, "Victoria, can you help your dad with his luggage? I'll grab something from the trunk."

Victoria nodded. Samuel retrieved a beautifully crafted, high-end dinnerware set from the trunk and walked over to Alvin. "Mr. Carter, it's our first meeting, and I didn't prepare much. This is a small token of my respect. I hope you like it."

Alvin initially declined but accepted it after seeing Samuel's sincerity. "Thank you, Samuel. I appreciate it. I'll head up now."

With that, Alvin dragged his luggage towards the house.

Samuel suddenly remembered something and grabbed Victoria's hand, looking slightly panicked. "Victoria, does your dad know your mom is here too?"

Victoria froze, realizing she had completely forgotten about it.

She looked out the car window in a panic, only to see Alvin already inside the villa.

Samuel looked at her, worried. "What do we do?"

He had seen Nora's temper before and knew things could get messy.

"Let them deal with it," Victoria said, feeling exhausted.

As she was about to head inside, Samuel suddenly pulled her close, his bright eyes reflecting only her.

He sighed softly and gently held her. "Why wasn't I the one by your side these past few days? When you needed me the most, I wasn't there. I'm really not a good boyfriend, am I?"

Victoria felt a warmth in her heart and quickly reassured him. "Don't say that. You couldn't control what happened. You didn't want it to be this way either."

Samuel's clear eyes narrowed slightly, a bitter smile on his face. "Just don't think I'm useless."

"Stop talking nonsense!" Victoria playfully slapped his chest, looking very affectionate. "If you keep saying that, I really won't talk to you anymore!"

"Okay, okay, I won't say it!" Samuel quickly coaxed her, pressing her head against his chest. "From now on, I'll listen to you. Whatever you say goes!"

Victoria couldn't help but laugh.

Being with him always made her feel relaxed.

"Come in and have a drink," she said.

"Sure."

Hand in hand, they walked towards the neighborhood.

At that moment, a tall figure slowly emerged from the shadows.

As he passed a trash can, he paused and casually tossed a small, exquisite velvet box into it.

Victoria and Samuel had just stepped inside when they heard Nora's sobbing.

She wasn't screaming like before but sat on the couch, looking frail and weak. Her sobs were suppressed and restrained, as if she had been deeply wronged.

"Where can I go? I have no home and I'm seriously ill," she choked out. "I gave up my only chance for a kidney transplant. I don't know how long I have left. If you make me leave now, you're just sending me to my death."

Her voice was filled with sorrow and a strong sense of pleading.

"I was wrong. I was wrong before. Please forgive me." She cried, tears streaming down her face, ruining her makeup. She looked pitiful and disheveled.

Victoria stood at the staircase corner, listening to Nora's tearful pleas, feeling nothing but a sense of disgust.

For so many years, Nora had always put on this act for her.

Out of mother-daughter affection, Victoria had always played along.

But now, she only felt annoyance.

Nora had never truly cared about her as a daughter.

Victoria listened with a cold expression, while Samuel's face changed slightly.

What did she mean by giving up her chance for a kidney transplant?

Was that because of her kindness? Definitely not.

But her words were still quite impactful.

No matter what, she was Victoria's mother and Alvin's wife of twenty years. She was seriously ill and homeless. How could they possibly ignore her and let her fend for herself?

Alvin sat on the couch, frowning, saying nothing.

"Victoria, I'll head out," Samuel said quietly. "It's your family matter, and it's not appropriate for me to stay."

Victoria nodded at him and turned to go inside, closing the door behind her.

Victoria sat down next to Alvin and looked at Nora, who was supposedly her mother. But in her heart, she felt she was less important to Nora than her old pets.

"You and my dad are already divorced. If there's no love left, why stay and make things awkward for everyone?" Victoria said coldly.

Nora wiped her tears and choked out, "Victoria, I've done many things to hurt you over the years. You have every right to hate me. But I really love your dad. I don't expect you to forgive me. I just want to spend my last days with you. Victoria, I'm begging you."

She grabbed Victoria's arm, her tone earnest.

Victoria remained unmoved. "You love my dad? You just see that he's out of prison and can support you again, so you're clinging to him."

###chapter 188 Part Ways Peacefully

Nora's thoughts were spot on, and a flash of anger crossed her face.

She raised her voice, "Victoria, I'm your mother! Don't you want a complete family? You haven't started your own family yet, so you don't get the pain of a broken marriage. When you get married, your husband's family will care about your background!"

Alvin hesitated and looked at Victoria.

But Victoria was completely indifferent, her tone cold, "A family that only brings torment is better off gone."

"You!"

"I just hope you two can part ways peacefully and not end up as enemies."

Victoria was too calm. Alvin glanced sideways at her, searching her face for any sign of reluctance or attachment.

At that moment, he suddenly understood that this broken marriage had left Victoria with nothing but pain and misfortune.

Alvin fell silent.

"What nonsense are you talking about?" Nora stared at her in disbelief, then looked at Alvin expectantly, "Alvin, say something!"

They say men become more attractive and steady in middle age. Alvin had kept up his fitness routine even in prison, his body tall and strong, his features rugged, exuding the charm of a mature man.

Nora's gaze was greedy, unable to look away.

A crazy obsession screamed in her heart: Alvin was hers, and he must remain hers!

"Alvin." Seeing him remain silent, Nora's tears began to fall again, "We were married once. Can you really bear to see me homeless?"

Alvin stood up, looking tired, "I'll take you to a hotel."

"I don't want to go to a hotel. This is my home!" Nora refused to comply.

Alvin turned back and gave her a deep look, his eyes full of helplessness, "I don't want to make a scene in front of Victoria."

Nora bit her lip and glared viciously at Victoria.

She felt a bit unwilling, but then she thought the chance to be alone with Alvin was rare and not to be missed.

Alvin had been in prison for years; who knew how long it had been since he had been with a woman?

Thinking this, her cheeks flushed slightly, and an indescribable heat surged in her heart.

Alvin took Nora and her luggage and left.

Victoria watched their backs for a long time before coming back to her senses. After thinking for a moment, she decided to text Daisy about what had happened today.

She was about to close the door and rest when the property staff came over.

"Ms. Carter, the cleaner found a bouquet and a jewelry box in the trash can outside your door. The card in the flowers had your name on it."

The staff handed Victoria a pink jewelry box, "Could you check if it's yours?"

Victoria took the box and opened it, revealing a large pink diamond ring. The inside of the ring was engraved with "W loves V". There was no need to guess who had sent it.

Victoria felt a pang in her heart, the blurry face from last night flashing in her mind. She closed her eyes.

When she opened them again, she was calm. She accepted the ring and politely thanked the property staff.

***

Alvin knew Nora always enjoyed luxury and had high material demands, so he arranged a deluxe suite for her. After completing the check-in, he prepared to leave.

Nora immediately grabbed his sleeve, seductively pleading, "Walk me up, please."

Alvin frowned, wanting to refuse. But she stepped closer, her voice tinged with fear, "It's late, and I'm a bit scared."

Nora knew Alvin could never resist her when she showed weakness. As soon as she did, he would soften.

Alvin checked his watch and saw it was late. After a moment of silence, he nodded slightly, "Alright, let's go."

Nora's eyes lit up instantly, and she followed him like a clingy kitten.

After taking Nora to her room, Alvin began to check around, looking for hidden cameras.

Nora watched his back, memories flooding her mind. He used to be so cautious every time they stayed in a hotel, checking the room thoroughly before leaving. Back then, she thought he was overly cautious and often argued with him, insisting on getting two rooms.

Now, thinking back, she realized how unreasonable she had been. She had missed out on a man who cared so much for her. Regret filled her heart.

Her eyes reddened, and she walked up behind him, hugging him tightly, choking out, "Alvin, stay with me tonight, please?"

Alvin's first reaction was to forcefully pull her hands away, quickly putting distance between them.

"We're divorced," he said coldly, the warmth from the past long gone.

Nora couldn't accept Alvin's change in attitude, her emotions collapsing, tears streaming down her face, "You said the divorce was to protect me. How can you be so heartless to me now?"

Alvin didn't want to discuss the past anymore, replying coldly, "Remember to lock the doors and windows. I'm leaving."

"You can't leave!" She grabbed him tightly, her emotions intense, breathing heavily, her face pale. "We haven't finished talking. You can't leave!"

Alvin frowned, forcefully breaking free from her grip, and moved to open the door.

"Alvin!" Nora, unwilling to give up, rushed forward, stumbling and falling into his arms, cold sweat on her forehead, her body trembling.

"What's wrong?" Alvin quickly supported her.

"I feel terrible." Her face showed pain, clearly not faking it.

Without hesitation, Alvin picked her up and carefully placed her on the bed.

"Don't go!" As he prepared to leave, Nora clung to his neck, refusing to let go despite her discomfort, using all her strength to keep him there.

"I'm in this state, and you still want to leave? What if something happens to me and I die here?"

"Don't talk nonsense."

"Alvin, you don't know how much I've suffered these years, not just in my heart, but..." her voice was low and muffled, "my body misses you too."

Alvin froze for a moment, his brow furrowing. Just as he was about to push her away, a mocking voice came from behind, "Nora, it seems like none of the guys you've been with have really made you happy."

Both Alvin and Nora were startled, turning quickly to see Daisy standing at the door with her arms crossed.

Alvin's face showed a brief flash of embarrassment, but he quickly regained his composure.

"Who invited you here?" Nora snapped angrily.

"You looked like you were dying, so I thought I'd come check on you out of old acquaintance," Daisy replied slowly.

"Mind your own business! Get out!"

Daisy glanced disdainfully at the bedridden Nora, smirking, "Still daring to order me around, huh?"

Nora was furious, about to retort when she noticed Alvin's discomfort, and suddenly realized.

She grabbed Alvin's arm, pulling him close, a mocking smile on her lips, "I see now, you're so interested in our family matters because you're after my man! Don't you know it's wrong to break up a family? Can't get married yourself, so you steal someone else's man? Have you no shame?"

###chapter 189 Announcing the Relationship

As soon as she spoke, not only did Daisy get angry, but Alvin's face darkened.

Daisy glared at Nora. "Your man? I remember you cheated on him over a decade ago and divorced him two years ago when he was down and out."

Daisy paused, then looked at Alvin with a mocking smile. "Are you two rekindling your old flame and getting remarried?"

Nora's face changed dramatically, and she raised her voice. "What nonsense are you spouting? My family's business is none of your concern!"

As she spoke, she tightened her grip on Alvin's arm.

Alvin frowned deeply, a hint of annoyance in his eyes. With a slight effort, he freed himself from her grasp.

"We're not getting remarried."

That brief sentence eased Daisy's expression a bit.

"Alvin!" Nora called out softly. Though she was older, her frequent visits to beauty salons and diligent self-care had preserved her mature charm.

Daisy snorted and rolled her eyes. "Are we leaving or not?" She glanced at Alvin, her tone tinged with impatience.

"Yes." Alvin responded sullenly and followed her.

"Alvin! Alvin!" Nora jumped out of bed in a hurry. "You can't leave. I'm still feeling unwell. What if something happens to me after you go?"

Alvin's steps faltered slightly.

Daisy's narrow eyes squinted as she turned back and yanked him out, muttering, "What are you worried about? During the years you were in prison, she lived quite comfortably without you! But Victoria had to work day and night to support her and her lover's son while they were living the high life!"

Victoria was Alvin's bottom line. The hardships she endured over the years had left deep, unhealed scars in Alvin's heart.

"You vile woman, stop talking nonsense!" Nora lunged forward, trying to explain, but Alvin turned and walked away without even sparing her a glance.

"Alvin!" Nora called out again.

Daisy stepped in front of her, her gaze darkening as she approached, lowering her voice with a menacing edge. "You're right. I do have ulterior motives. This man will be mine sooner or later, so you better give up now!"

"You bitch!" Nora raised her hand, ready to slap Daisy.

Daisy quickly caught her wrist, pushed her back, and slammed the door shut.

She straightened her clothes, turned around gracefully, and felt a wave of satisfaction.

But when she looked up, she saw Alvin standing at the end of the hallway.

Daisy pouted, slowly walked over in her high heels, and mumbled pitifully, "My feet hurt."

Alvin glanced at her indifferently, said nothing, and started walking away.

Daisy made a face behind his back, grumbling to herself, 'So heartless!'

As soon as the elevator doors opened, she stumbled and nearly twisted her ankle, hobbling out awkwardly.

Daisy was genuinely annoyed now. She had only pretended her foot pain, but it turned out to be true. 

She cursed Alvin under her breath, but when she looked up, she saw him waiting outside the elevator with a pair of fluffy slippers in his hand.

Without a word, he knelt down, held her ankle, swiftly removed her high heels, and put the slippers on her.

Daisy looked down at him, a small smile forming on her lips.

"Let's go." Alvin stood up and walked ahead.

Daisy felt much lighter on her feet, quickly catching up and linking her arm with his.

Alvin's body stiffened, and he tried to pull his arm back, but she held on tightly.

"Nora can hold you, but I can't? Are you still thinking about her?"

Before he could respond, Daisy fired off a rapid series of questions. "Alvin, are you blind? You have a beautiful, wealthy woman like me right here, and you still want your ex-wife? I'm telling you, if you dare remarry her, I'll turn your life upside down. Believe it or not?"

Alvin opened his mouth, glanced at her, then slowly pressed his lips together, his eyes full of helplessness.

Once they were out of the hotel, he finally spoke softly. "I won't remarry her."

Daisy was momentarily stunned, then broke into a wide smile, leaning closer to him. "What did you say? The wind's too strong, I didn't hear you."

To Alvin, she seemed like a mischievous little girl.

He extended a finger and gently poked her forehead. "Get in the car."

Alvin got in first, and Daisy stood there, covering her mouth with a smile.

Once inside, Daisy sent a message to Victoria: [Got him!]

Victoria replied instantly with a thumbs-up emoji.

Somehow, Alvin caught a glimpse of their conversation.

He raised an eyebrow slightly. "Victoria?"

Daisy didn't hide it, chatting with Victoria while asking, "What do you think Victoria should call me in the future? Ms. Scott sounds too formal, but calling me Mom feels awkward."

Alvin pretended not to hear, focusing on driving.

At a red light, Daisy suddenly reached over, hooked her arm around his neck, pulled him close, and kissed his cheek, snapping several photos in quick succession.

Alvin frowned, about to ask, "You..."

Daisy looked down, busy editing the photos on her phone. "I finally got you, of course I have to announce it to the world!"

Alvin sighed helplessly. Just then, the light turned green, and he restarted the car and drove off.

Victoria sat at her desk, studying. An open book lay in front of her, with a ring quietly resting beside it.

She hesitated, wondering if she should ask William about it. But what if the ring wasn't from him?

Wouldn't that be awkward?

As she wrestled with her thoughts, Wendy called.

"Victoria! Check the news, your mom tried to kill herself at a hotel."

Victoria froze, then hurriedly clicked the link Wendy sent. It was a video taken by a hotel guest.

In the footage, Nora was being carried into an ambulance, with onlookers whispering that her husband had a mistress who flaunted it on social media, driving her to take an overdose of sleeping pills. She had called the hotel in a daze, and soon she was noticed and received prompt medical attention.

Almost simultaneously, Samuel called, his voice urgent. "Wait for me, I'll take you to the hospital!"

###chapter 190 Dispute in the Ward

At the hospital

Reporters swarmed the entrance, making it almost impossible to get through. Police officers were doing their best to disperse the crowd.

Samuel held Victoria close, placing a hat on her head before they managed to squeeze inside and hurriedly make their way to the elevator.

Nora had been taken out of danger and moved to a hospital room, but she was still extremely agitated and crying uncontrollably.

Alvin sat across from her, head down, silent.

When Victoria arrived, she saw Daisy sitting alone outside the room.

"Ms. Scott?"

"I think I might have pushed her too far," Daisy said, looking a bit despondent. "I didn't want Alvin to have anything to do with her, so I posted a picture of us together. I never thought she'd gamble with her life over it."

She had asked the doctor, and the amount of sleeping pills Nora had taken was no joke. If they had been a few minutes later, she wouldn't have made it.

Nora had really risked her life, forcing Daisy to either back off or face her death.

At that moment, Daisy felt an overwhelming sense of exhaustion.

Fighting over a man with a woman like this, even if she came out on top, she would still be haunted by the emotional damage.

"You should go in first." Daisy needed time to sort out her thoughts.

Victoria wanted to comfort her but didn't know where to start. She nodded silently and entered the room with Samuel.

"I know you want to get rid of me. Now that you're out of prison and your career is picking up, you must think I'm old and sick, a burden. Daisy is younger and richer than me. I understand why you'd choose her. That's why I decided to let you go. If I die, you and Victoria will be free. After all, you both hate me."

Nora cried, covering her face with her hands, sobbing uncontrollably.

Hearing the door open, Alvin looked up at Victoria. Then he glanced at Daisy sitting outside before looking away.

Victoria walked in and saw Nora crying her heart out. She frowned slightly.

Samuel whispered in her ear, "I'll wait for you in the parking lot."

Victoria nodded.

Samuel greeted Alvin before thoughtfully leaving the room and closing the door quietly.

Nora cried even harder when she saw Victoria. "Victoria! Remember, I'm your real mother! How could you side with outsiders against me? You just want to drive me to my death so no one will need your kidney. I didn't realize how cruel you could be at such a young age!"

She struggled to get up, becoming more agitated. "Fine, I'll die! I'll make it easy for you all!"

Alvin quickly stood up and held her down, his voice low and stern. "Our issues have nothing to do with Victoria."

"Alvin, I can't live without you. If you leave me, what's the point of living? If you fall for someone else, it's like stabbing me with a knife! I'd rather die than see you with another woman. I don't want to live anymore."

She cried and flailed, her nails scratching Alvin's arms, leaving red marks.

Victoria, feeling sorry for Alvin, was about to help when Nora suddenly pushed her away, screaming hysterically, "Get away! You're not my daughter! I don't have a daughter who sides with her father's mistress! Victoria, you'll get your karma!"

Though Nora was weak from her suicide attempt, she pushed with surprising strength. Victoria stumbled into the corner, her head buzzing.

At that moment, the door burst open.

A pair of strong hands quickly helped her up.

Victoria steadied herself and turned to see William's deep, cold eyes.

She was shocked, never expecting him to be here.

His familiar presence inexplicably calmed her.

Alvin also saw him, his expression darkening, especially seeing how close William was to Victoria. He frowned deeply.

William's cold gaze swept over Nora.

He didn't even glance at Alvin, his eyes fixed on Nora with a hint of a smirk and a mocking tone. "Nora, let's talk."

Nora, fearing him, visibly calmed down the moment he entered the room.

Every time she saw William, she instinctively covered her neck, as if it still ached, her chest tightening.

She resisted, "I have nothing to talk about with you! Whatever you and Victoria do is your business. I don't care."

Hearing this, Alvin's face darkened further, and he pulled his hand away from her grip.

Victoria's cheeks flushed slightly.

William, however, chuckled and tossed a lawsuit onto the table.

"You bribed the media to spread rumors about my aunt being a mistress and staged a suicide drama to manipulate public opinion. Nora, it looks like you want to join Bobby."

Victoria was stunned, looking at Nora in disbelief. "Mom, did you do this?"

William raised an eyebrow. "Who else could it be?"

"I didn't!" Nora vehemently denied it, glaring at William with gritted teeth. "I know the Scott family has power and influence. It's easy for you to crush someone like me! But I'm telling you, I didn't do it! You just want to take revenge on me because of Victoria! If you have issues with her, deal with her, not me!"

She didn't hesitate to shift the blame onto Victoria.

Victoria's expression changed, and she slowly looked at Nora.

She knew Nora was stubborn and foolish, but she didn't expect her to still try to shift the blame at this point.

Alvin's face grew darker, frowning. "Why drag Victoria into this? It has nothing to do with her!"

"Do you think I'm stupid?" Nora glared at Victoria, her eyes red and swollen. "If she hadn't tipped off Daisy, how would she know we were at the hotel? She just sees Daisy as richer and William's aunt, so she sold me out to please William."

"Shut up!" William snapped. "Who do you think you are, daring to insult her in front of me?"

Victoria looked at him and softly called, "William."

"Don't speak!" William remained firm, not backing down even in front of Alvin when it came to defending Victoria.

Victoria hesitated, then instinctively closed her mouth.

But she quickly realized it was inappropriate and glanced at Alvin.

Alvin frowned, staring at William, his voice cold. "She's my daughter. Who gave you the right to talk to her like that?"

Victoria felt caught in the middle as the two men faced off again.

###chapter 191 Pleading

"Dad-" Victoria was frantic, wanting to step forward and intervene.

But as soon as she opened her mouth, William pulled her behind him.

William sneered, looking Alvin straight in the eye without a hint of fear. "What's wrong with the way I'm talking to her?"

"When she was borrowing money everywhere for Bobby's tuition and Nora's medical bills, where were you? When she was bullied and burned, where were you? When she was falsely accused and insulted, where were you?"

Alvin's face changed slightly, a flash of pain and guilt in his eyes.

Victoria, feeling sorry for Alvin, didn't want him to be questioned like this. She pleaded softly, "William, stop."

But William ignored her, his gaze growing colder and his tone sharper. "Nora and Bobby treat her like a servant, take her money, and even try to take her kidney. She's suffered so much, and now you still stand by and watch Nora pick on her. Have you fulfilled your duty as a father?"

William pulled Victoria in front of him, holding her hand tightly in front of Alvin.

"I admit, I've been harsh to her these past two years and have done many things to hurt her. But I've always protected her! For her, I'd give up my life!"

Alvin's fists clenched tightly, his knuckles turning white.

"William, that's enough! Stop talking!" Victoria couldn't hold back anymore. She pushed his hand away and hurried to Alvin, anxiously saying, "Dad, don't listen to him. I'm really fine. I'm doing well."

William's face darkened, glaring at Victoria.

This ungrateful woman!

Alvin shook his head slowly, his voice full of disappointment and defeat. "No, it's me who didn't protect you."

Nora finally understood that William was standing up for Victoria!

She couldn't admit to any of this and immediately retorted, "Stop making things up."

William, already fuming from Victoria's earlier actions, turned his head and gave Nora a cold, sidelong glance, sneering. "Save it for my lawyer."

His intention was clear: he wanted to send Nora to jail!

Ever since Nora had coveted Victoria's kidney, William had this idea. Someone like her didn't deserve to be around Victoria!

Nora's face turned pale instantly. She knew William's methods; he was ruthless when he wanted to be!

She didn't dare openly resist and could only cry and plead with Alvin for help.

But Alvin, tormented by William's earlier questioning, was too focused on how to make it up to Victoria to pay any attention to Nora.

No matter how much Nora cried and hinted, he remained unmoved.

At this moment, the hospital staff arrived.

Without a word, Alvin grabbed Victoria and prepared to leave.

"No! Alvin, you can't go! I need you!"

Alvin didn't respond, pushing the door open and leaving.

Victoria finally breathed a sigh of relief.

As she stepped out, she saw Samuel. Daisy was talking to him about something, and he was looking down, his handsome face unreadable.

Victoria didn't have time to say anything to him. She turned back to William. "Come with me."

Her tone wasn't exactly gentle.

Alvin glanced at Victoria, wanting to stop her, but seeing the determination in her eyes, he slowly lowered his hand.

William's lips curled into a faint smile, raising an eyebrow as he casually slipped his hands into his pockets. He glanced at Samuel before following her unhurriedly.

Samuel looked up, his gaze fixed on the two of them until they disappeared around the corner.

On a small platform at the end of the hallway, Victoria stopped and turned to stare directly at William. "Are you really going to sue her?"

William seemed quite pleased, leaning against the wall and looking at her with a tilted head. "What, you want to plead for her?"

Victoria frowned, her tone tinged with helplessness. "I don't want to drag my dad into this."

Alvin again!

William snorted disdainfully. "Do you really need to worry so much about him?"

No matter what he said, Victoria kept her eyes on him, continuing to press. "You have a way, don't you?"

Her words amused William. He raised an eyebrow and asked, "Why do you think I'd help him?"

Victoria was silent for a moment, reluctantly taking a small step forward, "You will help, right?"

William glared at her, annoyed. "No!"

His previously good mood was instantly ruined by her words; his handsome face turned icy, as if covered in frost.

Victoria grew anxious, her words spilling out rapidly. "This also involves your aunt. If you really didn't care, why did you come all this way tonight?"

William took a deep breath and suddenly laughed, stepping closer with a powerful presence. "How do you know I came for Aunt Daisy?"

"If not for her, then who? It can't be for me, right?"

Victoria laughed at herself, but looking at his face, she couldn't muster a smile.

She stared at him, biting her lower lip, and asked softly, "Did you really come for me?"

William gritted his teeth. "No. Why would I come for you? Why would I come all this way for a heartless woman like you?"

William was genuinely angry now.

He placed his hands on his hips, the angrier he got, the more his smile seemed eerie.

"How could I forget? You have a boyfriend now. Why would you need to ask me for such a small thing? Just go to your boyfriend!"

Victoria's face turned sour. She lifted her shimmering eyes, responding stiffly, "You don't need to mock me. If you don't want to help, fine. Just pretend I never asked!"

She turned to leave.

William frowned, grabbing her arm. "Is this how you ask for help?"

"I was polite enough! What more do you want?" She angrily shook off his hand. "You said my mom picked on me, but I think the one who picked on me the most is you! It was like this before, and it's still like this now!"

William laughed.

He raised his hand, pointing a finger at her chest.

Victoria instinctively raised her arm to protect herself, her face full of vigilance. "What are you doing?"

He narrowed his eyes, a wicked smile on his lips. "I'm telling you, I want to pick on you right now!"

"You-"

Before she could finish, he suddenly lowered his head, capturing her soft, moist lips, forcefully prying open her teeth and invading her mouth.

###chapter 192 Blind Date

Victoria's eyes widened in shock, and she struggled fiercely, but the difference in strength between men and women was too great. She was held tightly in his arms.

After a long while, he finally let her go. Looking at the breathless Victoria in his arms, he curved his thin lips into a smile. "Victoria, you can't escape."

With that, he ignored her angry expression and turned to leave the hospital.

Victoria stood there, staring blankly at William's retreating figure, unable to snap out of it for a long time.

She suddenly remembered all the things he had done to her in the past.

The hurt and humiliation, the protection and indulgence, all intertwined into a dense web that enveloped her completely, leaving her nowhere to hide.

After a while, she took out a small mirror from her bag, tidied up her appearance, and, after confirming there was nothing amiss, turned to leave.

In the hallway, Samuel asked softly, "Finished talking?" 

"Yeah." Victoria's expression was calm, with no intention of hiding anything. "He wants to sue my mom for Ms. Scott."

Samuel was taken aback and instinctively asked, "You're not against it?"

Victoria was silent for a moment before speaking softly, "My mom is the kind of person who will stop at nothing to achieve her goals, regardless of the consequences. If she really hurt Ms. Scott, I have no right to oppose William's actions."

Samuel gazed at her quietly, then gently put his arm around her shoulder.

Victoria suddenly remembered something and looked up at him. "What were you talking about with Ms. Scott earlier?"

"Just some casual conversation," Samuel thought for a moment and added, "More like an elder showing concern for a younger person."

Just a moment ago, Daisy had told him that once William set his sights on someone, his possessiveness would be unimaginably strong, and no one could predict what he might do.

Samuel didn't comment on this, just smiled.

Whatever William wanted to do, he was welcome to try.

The more William did, the more he would push Victoria towards him.

***

William was very efficient.

In just one night, all news reports about Nora's suicide were taken down.

Even the search terms were gone, and the media received a strict gag order. Anyone who wanted to stay in the industry had to keep their mouths shut.

This was the power of capital-arrogant and domineering, yet leaving people helpless.

Although there were still some sporadic discussions online, it wouldn't be long before they were replaced by other hot news.

Victoria went to Samuel's studio as usual to pick up the monthly paintings, thinking that she might be able to have lunch with Samuel afterward.

In the studio, Ryan was working on his laptop. When he saw Victoria come in, he was slightly taken aback, a hint of hesitation flashing across his face.

"Victoria, you're here." Ryan stood up, greeting her somewhat awkwardly.

"Yeah, I'm here to pick up this month's paintings." Victoria responded with a smile, her eyes searching the studio for Samuel. "Where's Samuel?"

"He has a public lecture at the university today."

"Alright." Victoria sighed in disappointment. "I'll just take the paintings and go then."

"Wait a minute!" Ryan called out to her. "Victoria."

Victoria stopped and turned to look at him.

They stared at each other.

Ryan pressed his lips together, not saying anything.

Victoria, sensing something was off, raised an eyebrow in confusion. "What's wrong with you? You seem weird."

Ryan hesitated for a long time before finally speaking. "Victoria, I need to tell you something, but don't get mad."

"What is it? Why so serious?" Victoria looked calm, with no sign of panic in her eyes.

"I just found out that Samuel's dad is setting him up on a blind date tonight," Ryan blurted out, his eyes fixed on Victoria.

Victoria paused for a moment, then her expression returned to normal. "I see."

Ryan was surprised. He had expected Victoria to be furious and question him.

But her extraordinary calmness left him at a loss. "You're not mad?"

"Mad? Why would I be mad?" Victoria asked lightly.

She shrugged and continued, "It might just be a well-meaning gesture from his parents. Nothing to make a fuss about."

Aside from that initial moment of surprise, Victoria remained exceptionally composed, genuinely seeming to trust Samuel from the bottom of her heart.

Ryan frowned in suspicion. "This doesn't seem right!"

Victoria looked puzzled. "What's not right? Trusting each other in a relationship is the most basic requirement, isn't it?"

"That depends on the situation! You're way too calm. This isn't how someone should react when they hear their boyfriend is going on a blind date. Can anyone be this rational in a relationship?" Ryan stared at her in confusion. "Victoria, do you really not care at all about Samuel going on a blind date?"

"I don't care. He's probably just humoring his dad. Nothing to worry about."

"Have you considered that the blind date was arranged by Samuel's dad? It might mean he doesn't approve of you as Samuel's girlfriend."

Victoria hadn't thought about it that way. She frowned slightly and said slowly, "Why does it have to be so complicated?"

"Of course it is! Dating might be between two people, but marriage involves two families. Many couples end up divorcing because of conflicts with their in-laws. Samuel really loves you, and I hope you two can make it. You need to handle these issues properly."

Victoria hadn't thought that far ahead. She looked at Ryan in shock. "Wow, Ryan, you, a single guy, can think so far ahead and so much!"

Ryan glared at her. "I don't usually think this much, but Samuel is my good friend, so I worry more."

Victoria laughed. "You're really a good friend to him!"

"But are you just going to wait? Wait for him to come clean with you?"

Victoria shook her head with a smile. "It's fine if he doesn't. Everyone's entitled to some secrets."

Ryan's expression changed slightly, and he cautiously asked, "What if it were William? If you knew he was going on a blind date, would you be just as indifferent?"

Victoria was about to say "I wouldn't," but the words got stuck in her throat.

A strange feeling of suffocation rose in her chest, as if something was lodged in her throat, unable to go up or down.

She didn't need to say anything; her reaction said it all.

Ryan pressed his lips together, deliberated for a moment, and then spoke softly. "Victoria, your current boyfriend is Samuel. You need to step into your role as his girlfriend."

As a friend, Ryan was very considerate and usually wouldn't bring up such personal matters.

He must have been really concerned to speak up for Samuel.

Victoria opened her mouth, but the words she wanted to say were swallowed back. In the end, she just smiled gently and said softly, "I understand."

Seeing that she had listened, Ryan was silent for a moment before continuing. "There's one more thing. Samuel didn't want me to tell you, fearing you'd get angry. But I think you should know the truth."

He paused, as if making a decision, and then said, "When your dad had an accident in Xandria, Samuel found out and immediately took leave from school, bought a ticket for the earliest flight, and went to find you. But..."

Victoria's expression turned serious. "But what?"

"But someone reported him for laundering money through high-priced paintings."

###chapter 193 A Chance Encounter

Victoria's eyes widened, and her heart clenched.

"Because of this mess, he got banned from leaving the country, all his bank accounts were frozen, and he almost got kicked out of school. If his parents hadn't stepped in and if he wasn't innocent, who knows what would've happened," Ryan said, taking a deep breath.

"His parents only asked him to agree to go on a date with the person they set him up with, or else they'd bring the matter to your attention," he added.

Victoria stood there, stunned, unable to speak.

Seeing her reaction, Ryan tried to comfort her. "Even if I didn't tell you, you probably could've guessed who was behind this. Samuel didn't want me to tell you, so just act like you don't know."

"I get it. Thanks, Ryan," Victoria said, forcing a bitter smile.

She understood Ryan's intentions, but the more she did, the more guilt and self-blame she felt towards Samuel.

Ryan looked at her, hesitating to say more.

***

As the workday was winding down, the light in the gallery softened. Victoria and Wendy were still busy wrapping things up.

Just then, Diana walked in, dressed simply yet elegantly, her face beautiful and features delicate.

Seeing the two still working, she smiled lightly. "All done? Dinner's on me tonight."

Joshua's artwork had been a hit with buyers, earning the gallery a good profit. Diana was in a great mood and wanted to treat Victoria.

"This restaurant's food is amazing!" Diana said with a slight smile. "I often come here for business meetings and to entertain artist friends. The reputation is impeccable."

Wendy, curious, her eyes sparkling, said, "You run this gallery so effortlessly, with such a wide network and always discovering great food."

Diana glanced at her, a faint smile on her lips. "Running a business is all about creating the right atmosphere and building relationships. For the gallery to thrive, you need to maintain good relations with everyone. Over time, business becomes easier."

The three of them sat down and were about to order when a group of people walked in.

William and Alice were at the back.

As soon as he entered, William's eyes immediately scanned the room and landed on Victoria, who was sitting in a corner.

Alice noticed too and asked considerately, "Do you want to go say hi?"

Her demeanor was gracious and understanding.

"No need," William replied, looking away as if he hadn't seen her.

Eugene, who had come along, sat next to William and quietly probed, "Having a fight?"

He was, of course, referring to William and Victoria.

William took a sip of his tea, not responding.

"That's odd. When you guys came back from Xandria, it seemed like there was hope for you two. Guess I was wrong," Eugene said, half-joking, with a hint of schadenfreude.

If he had to choose between Victoria and Alice, he would lean towards Alice. They had grown up together, and the bond was deep. Victoria seemed like an unexpected intruder.

Plus, with all the complicated issues involving Alvin and the Scott family, the road ahead for those two was bound to be bumpy.

Eugene glanced at Alice, who was chatting and laughing with the investors, and said, "Compared to Victoria, I think Alice suits you better. Look at her, despite everything, she still cares for you and helps you out. She used her connections to help you with X-STAR Solutions Inc. Without her, your new project wouldn't have progressed so smoothly. She supports you in both life and career. She's your best partner."

He glanced at Victoria and shook his head. "She can't compare to Alice. Besides, I heard she has a boyfriend now. Don't dwell on it too much. Appreciate the one in front of you."

If William didn't know Eugene's playful nature, he might have thought he was bribed.

After a long silence, William spoke slowly, "Maybe without her, I would marry Alice, but it would never be the same."

Eugene understood the depth of his words.

Marrying out of gratitude and marrying out of love are two different things.

He might marry Alice, but the feelings of love and attachment had never been there for her.

There could be responsibility and care, but that wasn't love.

Across the room, Wendy noticed William too and was surprised to see him here.

She quickly looked at Victoria.

"Stop staring and eat," Victoria said quietly, continuing to enjoy her meal as if William was just a stranger.

Eugene and the others were having a lively conversation. Alice, no longer the aloof and noble figure she once was, was enthusiastically toasting the investors.

Though it wasn't a formal business meeting, just a private dinner, she was doing everything to support William.

When Jerald McClellan, the head of the investors, suggested a drink with William, Alice quickly raised her glass, smiling, "Mr. McClellan, I'll drink on his behalf. You see, he recently got injured in Xandria and should be resting, but he came here to meet you."

Jerald's impression of William improved significantly.

"To be honest, I've heard a lot about Mr. Scott in Harborview City," Jerald said, his words carefully chosen, but William knew they were likely negative rumors.

He had been developing in Silvermist City for the past two years, not Harborview City, but the rumors had spread widely. Now, he knew who was behind them.

William sincerely said, "Mr. McClellan, I'm looking forward to working with X-STAR Solutions Inc."

Alice raised her glass again, smiling, "Mr. McClellan, another toast to you on William's behalf."

"Ms. Garcia, you are truly devoted to Mr. Scott. It's admirable! Mr. Scott, you should cherish Ms. Garcia," Jerald said.

William glanced at Alice, her cheeks flushed. She had already had quite a bit to drink at lunch and was now just holding on.

Jerald loved to drink, and to discuss business with him, one had to drink a lot. Alice knew this and was drinking for William.

Seeing her determination, even Eugene was moved and wanted to help, but she politely declined.

"Mr. McClellan and I are enjoying our drinks. Don't interrupt."

Jerald laughed heartily, "That's right, it's rare to find such a spirited drinking partner!"

William frowned, placing his hand over hers as she reached for another glass. "That's enough. Stop drinking."

"Don't worry about it," she whispered, pouring another glass and toasting Jerald.

In no time, the bottle of red wine was empty.

If Jerald's secretary hadn't come to remind him about his flight, they might have continued drinking.

William and Alice escorted Jerald out, who said cheerfully, "Send the contract over tomorrow."

As soon as Jerald left, Alice lost all her strength, her body leaning softly against William.

Feeling him support her, she struggled slightly, her voice slurred, "I'm fine, just a bit dizzy. I'll be okay after some water. Let go, Ms. Carter is watching. Don't let her misunderstand. I can walk on my own."

###chapter 194 Rear-End Collision

William's gaze was intense, but his hand on her waist stayed steady.

"Let's get you inside."

Without waiting for a reply, he guided Alice into the restaurant.

Victoria had a perfect view of the scene unfolding between them.

As they walked in, Alice was practically nestled in William's arms, her cheeks flushed. Her delicate and vulnerable appearance would evoke sympathy from anyone.

Victoria glanced at them briefly before looking away, uninterested.

Wendy whispered, "Looks like they're rekindling their old flame."

At first glance, it did seem that way.

But Victoria didn't care much. Whether they got back together or not, what did it matter to her? She wasn't William's girlfriend.

During the meal, Victoria got up to use the restroom.

When she came out, she saw Alice leaning against the sink, mumbling about feeling unwell.

William gently held her, letting her rest against his chest, soothing her softly, "I'll take you to the hospital for an IV soon."

"No, I hate hospitals. I never want to go there again."

"It's just an IV, it won't hurt."

"I'm scared."

Victoria pursed her lips, initially intending to walk past them as if she hadn't seen anything. But that felt too deliberate, making her seem guilty.

She took a deep breath, walked over casually, and turned on the faucet to wash her hands.

As she looked up, her eyes met William's in the mirror.

She paused briefly, then quickly composed herself and asked calmly, "It seems Ms. Garcia had too much to drink. Do you need help?"

William stared at her deeply for a moment, about to speak, when Samuel suddenly appeared.

"Victoria!"

Victoria looked surprised, "Samuel? What are you doing here?"

"I'm having dinner with friends upstairs. I ran into Wendy and the others on my way down."

As he approached, he noticed William and then Alice in his arms. His eyes flickered slightly, and he smiled, "What a coincidence, Mr. Scott. Ms. Garcia had too much to drink? Need a hand?"

"No need." William's expression remained cold and aloof, as always. He didn't even spare another glance, just held Alice's shoulder and asked softly, "Can you walk?"

Alice looked up at him with misty eyes, shaking her head pitifully, "My legs are weak, I can't stand."

He nodded slightly, then without another word, scooped her up and strode away.

Victoria lowered her gaze, grabbed a paper towel to dry her hands, and said softly, "Let's go too."

Samuel followed her, hesitatingly asking, "Why are you here today?"

Victoria stopped, "Our boss is treating us."

Samuel nodded, seeming relieved, but there was a hint of disappointment.

Victoria found his behavior odd and turned to look at him, "Samuel, is something bothering you today?"

Samuel was taken aback.

He shook his head slowly, "What could be bothering me?"

He turned and left quickly, as if eager to escape something.

Victoria was even more puzzled.

As Samuel left the restaurant, someone called out to him.

"Samuel."

He turned around to see a long-haired girl in a black coat, her straight hair cascading over her shoulders, smiling brightly at him, "We agreed, next time it's my treat."

Samuel was momentarily stunned, instinctively glancing towards the parking lot, then quickly said, "Ms. Wright, you're too kind."

"Thanks for treating me today. Next time, I'll take you to a movie, okay?" Hannah Wright's cheeks flushed slightly, a bit shy.

Samuel responded casually, saying, "My friends are waiting for me," and hurried away.

Easter was coming up, and Starry Studio Gallery was gearing up for a big Easter-themed exhibition. Diana asked Victoria and Wendy to pick up some flowers and decorations.

Victoria had gotten her driver's license while working as William's secretary, and under his guidance, her driving skills were pretty solid.

The car she drove was a second-hand one Alvin had found. It looked ordinary but was spacious enough for daily use.

"Victoria, let me drive." Wendy had just gotten her license and was eager to get behind the wheel.

"Sure, you drive." Victoria, always indulgent towards her, handed over the keys without hesitation and settled into the passenger seat.

Wendy was thrilled, gripping the steering wheel tightly, her eyes wide open, staring straight ahead, nervous sweat forming on her forehead.

Victoria sat beside her, occasionally reminding her softly, "Turn signal on, turn slowly."

Seeing a Rolls-Royce merging ahead, Victoria's heart tightened, quickly advising, "That's a luxury car ahead, keep your distance."

Before she finished speaking, there was a loud crash as their car collided with the Rolls-Royce.

Wendy was silent.

Victoria's mind went blank for a moment. Hearing Wendy's tearful voice brought her back to reality.

"Victoria."

Wendy was completely stunned, her voice trembling, "Did I just rear-end a Rolls-Royce?"

Wendy's family was well-off, but her mother was very strict, giving her little pocket money.

If she asked for money, her mother would likely exaggerate the situation to her father.

Wendy didn't want to be used as a pawn in their power struggle.

Victoria quickly calmed down, speaking gently, "Don't worry, I'll go check."

When she handed the keys to Wendy, Victoria had mentally prepared herself for minor accidents. But rear-ending a luxury car was beyond her expectations.

Victoria got out of the car, just as someone stepped out of the Rolls-Royce.

Fortunately, the accident didn't happen in a busy area, so there was no traffic jam.

"Sorry, it's our fault. My friend just got her license."

"Victoria?"

Victoria looked up, "Harry?"

She hadn't expected to see a familiar face. Just as she felt relieved, her heart sank again, wondering if the car belonged to William.

Sure enough, William stepped out of the car.

Victoria was speechless.

Seeing it was someone they knew, Wendy quickly got out, "Mr. Scott, I'm sorry, it's all my fault."

William's deep eyes briefly rested on Victoria before looking away coldly.

Victoria's hand tightened in her sleeve, but she maintained a distant demeanor, matching his coldness.

"Was it you driving?" He directed the question at Wendy.

"Yes." Wendy looked down, embarrassed, "How much will the repairs cost? I'll pay, but can I do it in installments?"

Victoria wouldn't let her pay, immediately saying, "No need to pay, we have insurance."

William glanced at his car, saying indifferently, "The insurance won't cover all my losses. The extra amount could buy you a new car."

Victoria frowned, seeing Wendy's pale face, silently blaming William for scaring her.

She didn't believe he would be so serious about this.

But since they hit his car, paying for the damages was only right. She said, "Whatever the cost, I'll pay."

Victoria looked at Harry, "You have my number. Let me know the repair cost."

Harry didn't dare respond, glancing at William.

Victoria turned to Wendy, "Let's go."

As they got back in the car, before Victoria could close the door, it was pulled open again.

"Get out." William grabbed her arm, pulling her out of the car.

###chapter 195 Alice's Help

"William! What the heck are you doing?"

William shoved Victoria into his Rolls-Royce without a second thought. 

"Take her home," he commanded, indicating Wendy with a glance.

Harry caught on immediately. Just as Wendy was about to step in, he quickly nudged her back into the car. "Come on, come on, what's going on? Let me help."

The car door closed with a sharp click, followed by the sound of the lock engaging.

"William!" Victoria sat in the passenger seat, her cheeks puffed up in anger, glaring at him with wide eyes. "Are you out of your mind?"

William started the car smoothly, making a sharp U-turn, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "Didn't you say you wanted to pay for the car repairs? How can we do that without an estimate?"

"I told you, Harry can tell me."

"Victoria, this isn't a small amount. We're talking about repair costs that could easily run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. Why do you think I can easily trust you?"

Victoria was momentarily speechless.

She had indeed relied on their past relationship, and now that he had ruthlessly exposed her, her face burned with embarrassment. She forced herself to say, "Fine, let's get the estimate first. I'll pay whatever it costs."

William's eyes narrowed slightly, the mockery in them growing more intense. "I know you have a good salary, and your dad's business is picking up. Of course, you wouldn't think twice about this kind of money."

"William, if you have something to say, just say it. Why do you have to be so sarcastic? Who could have predicted this bad luck, rear-ending your car of all things? Don't make it sound like we did it on purpose!"

William briefly glanced at her, his tone indifferent. "You're so self-righteous, I almost forgot you rear-ended me."

Victoria glared at him fiercely, turning her head away in a huff, refusing to engage further.

He really drove to the Car Service Center.

Since they were handling it privately and she was taking full responsibility, there was no need to involve the traffic authorities. Coming here to get a rough estimate of the repair costs made sense.

William leisurely sat in the VIP lounge, sipping the coffee the manager personally brought him, watching Victoria bustle around with a calm demeanor.

When Victoria received the estimate showing $250,000, she felt a wave of dizziness. She pinched herself, trying to stay composed.

Her insurance would cover up to $150,000, leaving her to pay the remaining $100,000 out of pocket.

This meant she suddenly owed William $100,000.

"William? What are you doing here?"

Alice walked in, her gaze casually sweeping over Victoria before giving her a polite smile. "You two aren't here on a date, are you? That's a new one, coming to a Car Service Center for a date. Is the food here that good?"

Victoria, filled with anxiety, had no time for Alice's possibly genuine or joking comment. Her eyes were fixed on the daunting number on the estimate.

William raised an eyebrow. "What brings you here?"

"I got a new car last month. It has a minor issue, so I scheduled a check-up for today."

The manager nodded repeatedly. "Ms. Garcia, please have a seat and relax."

Alice, being smart, didn't sit next to William but chose a spot beside Victoria on the same couch.

"Ms. Carter, what's wrong? You look so worried. Did something happen?"

Victoria took a deep breath, forcing a smile that looked more like a grimace. "Nothing much, just suddenly owing $100,000."

"What?" After hearing the story, Alice quickly tried to mediate. "William, it's just $100,000. Don't make it hard for Ms. Carter."

Victoria looked at Alice with newfound appreciation. Regardless of her motives, that was a decent thing to say. Coming up with $100,000 all at once was a bit much for her.

"I'm not forcing her. She admitted full responsibility and even offered to write an IOU."

Victoria fell silent.

Alice smiled sweetly. "Then I'll pay it for her."

Victoria's eyes widened in disbelief. Alice had changed? This was $100,000! And she was offering to help just like that?

William's brows furrowed, and he finally looked up, giving Alice a cold glance. "Why should you clean up her mess?"

"Don't say that. We're all friends here. Besides, it's just $100,000. It's not a big deal."

Victoria almost thought she misheard. Alice was acting out of character. $100,000, and she didn't even blink?

But William's gaze grew colder. "Whoever's at fault should take responsibility."

He glanced at Victoria's slightly pale but still delicate face, noting the fleeting surprise and gratitude in her eyes. His frown deepened. Why hadn't he noticed before how money-hungry she was? A mere $100,000, and she was looking at Alice with such admiration. If he'd known, he would have used money to keep her close.

Victoria snapped back to reality, her mind clearing. She politely thanked Alice. "I appreciate your kindness, Ms. Garcia. This man may be annoying, but he's right. If it's my responsibility, I have to bear it. Even if it's a million dollars, I can't shirk it."

Alice turned to William, her voice soft and persuasive. "William, don't hold it against Ms. Carter. Do it for me, okay?"

Victoria never expected Alice to humble herself to plead with William on her behalf.

William's expression grew darker. He hadn't intended to make her pay. He was just annoyed when she turned to leave and wanted to tease her. Alice's plea gave him an excuse.

William waved his hand, pretending to be magnanimous. "Since you asked, I'll let her off the hook."

Victoria thought she'd be happy about the waived compensation, but it felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured over her, revealing a harsh truth. To William, Alice was the special one. A casual word from her could change his mind.

Alice couldn't hide her joy but carefully concealed it, turning to comfort Victoria. "Ms. Carter, William is just like a child. Don't take it to heart."

Though she was apologizing for William, her words hinted at their closeness, a bond others couldn't reach.

"Of course not. I'm very grateful for William's generosity. But William, rest assured, when I have the money, I'll pay you back in installments."

William narrowed his eyes, letting out a cold snort. "You're really something. Even your insincere diplomatic words sound smooth."

Victoria gritted her teeth. What was wrong with William today? Couldn't he go a minute without mocking her? But knowing she was in the wrong, she suppressed her anger, forcing a smile. "It's not insincere. I mean it."

"You? Mean it?"

"You!" Victoria really didn't want to say another word to him!

###chapter 196 Easter Gathering

To Victoria, it seemed like William was deliberately causing trouble, but to Alice, this was just their unique way of interacting, something others couldn't quite understand.

William always kept his cool in front of her.

Alice lowered her eyes slightly and chuckled softly, "William, if you keep talking like that, you'll scare Ms. Carter away."

William stiffened for a moment and then fell silent.

But Victoria sensed something was off and quickly explained, "There's nothing special between William and me!"

Afraid she wouldn't be believed, she added hastily, "My boyfriend is Samuel."

Alice was visibly taken aback and instinctively glanced at William.

William looked like a detached outsider, indifferent to whatever Victoria said or what she meant to him.

Seeing this, Alice gave an awkward smile, "I'm sorry, I didn't know you two had split."

"We never had anything to begin with." Victoria was determined to clear things up completely.

Since Alice and William seemed to be rekindling their relationship, she didn't want to be caught in the middle and end up in an awkward situation.

William suddenly stood up, giving Victoria an impatient glance, "I have things to do. If you have any questions, ask Harry."

Without waiting for her response, he turned to Alice, "Can you give me a ride?"

Alice smiled gently, "Of course."

Watching them leave, Victoria felt a sudden release of tension, followed by an inexplicable sense of loss. She felt exhausted, both physically and mentally, and wanted nothing more than to curl up in a small corner, away from the world.

Outside the lounge, she could faintly hear the staff's exclamations, "They make such a perfect couple! Both from wealthy families, good-looking, and rich. Even TV shows can't come up with such a perfect pair!"

"So enviable! If they don't end up together, it would be frustrating!"

"Did you see that? He really dotes on her! She just asked for a favor, and he waived a hundred thousand dollars in losses just like that! What a love story!"

Victoria walked out, and even though she didn't have to pay, she couldn't feel happy.

After thinking it over, she decided to return the money. She had asked him for money to pay Nora's hospital bills because she had no other choice. But now, taking advantage of him again would be wrong.

Back home, Victoria locked herself in her room and started drawing.

She had received a commission from a publishing house to provide illustrations for a children's book. She had been procrastinating due to other commitments, but if she could finish this job, combined with her savings and a loan from Alvin, she could gather the hundred thousand dollars to repay William.

She carefully sketched, and one by one, the charming cartoon characters began to take shape on the paper.

She couldn't help but smile.

Work was the only thing that could make her forget her troubles.

Victoria pulled an all-nighter and only took a short nap at dawn.

When she arrived at Starry Studio Gallery with dark circles under her eyes, Wendy was startled, "Victoria, what happened to you? You look exhausted!"

Victoria rubbed her eyes and yawned, "I stayed up all night working on illustrations."

She went into the office and downed several cups of coffee to regain some energy.

"Victoria, how much do we need to pay for yesterday's incident? I have some savings," Wendy said sincerely, sitting next to her.

Victoria shook her head, "No need."

Wendy frowned, "It was my fault. I can't let you bear the cost."

"Wendy, it's fine. We have insurance," Victoria reassured her with a smile.

Victoria didn't want to make Wendy feel bad, so she didn't tell her the truth.

Hearing this, Wendy seemed relieved, and they both went back to their work.

***

On Easter morning, sunlight filtered through the thin clouds, casting a golden glow over the small yard.

Victoria got up early and started decorating the living room with the carefully chosen decorations.

Last Christmas, Alvin was still in prison, and she had spent it alone, feeling miserable.

But now, Alvin was finally out, and they could celebrate a holiday together.

Alvin came out of the kitchen, wearing an apron and holding a spatula, ready to serve breakfast. He saw Victoria standing in the living room, smiling to herself.

He called out cheerfully, "Victoria, come have breakfast first."

Victoria obediently responded and walked over to the table.

After breakfast, they started decorating together.

Victoria handed Alvin a colorful Easter egg, "Dad, look at this egg. It's so pretty! Let's hang it by the window. It'll look amazing in the sunlight."

Alvin took the egg and examined it closely, his eyes full of warmth, "Yes, it's very beautiful."

They chatted as they decorated.

Victoria carefully hung streamers from the ceiling while Alvin arranged bunny figurines around the room.

The fluffy little bunnies added a lively touch to the house.

Soon, the doorbell rang.

Victoria opened the door to find Wendy standing there with a big basket, smiling, "Victoria, I'm here! I brought some homemade treats for Easter. Let's enjoy them together."

Victoria smiled and took the basket, "Thank you."

Wendy was immediately captivated by the cozy decorations inside, "You two did an amazing job! This looks even better than the gallery!"

The three of them sat around the table, enjoying Wendy's treats, which included sweet and soft hot cross buns and adorable bunny-shaped cookies.

Victoria couldn't resist taking a big bite of a treat, "This is delicious, Wendy. You're so talented."

Alvin nodded in agreement, smiling at Wendy, "Wendy, I've heard from Victoria how much you've helped her. Thank you so much!"

Wendy quickly replied, "Mr. Carter, no need to be so formal! Victoria and I are friends!"

As they were talking, the doorbell rang again.

Samuel stood there with a pot of blooming tulips and a big box of imported chocolates, "Mr. Carter, Victoria, happy Easter! I thought I'd join the fun."

Victoria welcomed him in with a smile.

Alvin was even happier to see Samuel.

He genuinely liked Samuel.

Samuel was mature, polite, and clearly in love with Victoria.

Victoria watched them chat and eat treats while sending holiday greetings to her colleagues, former classmates, and teachers on her phone.

When she scrolled past William's name, she paused.

Daisy had gone back to Harborview City to be with Garth.

So, William was alone.

No, Alice was there too. She wouldn't let him be alone.

As Victoria was lost in thought, Samuel's phone suddenly rang.

He glanced at the caller ID, frowned slightly, and then hung up, continuing to chat with Alvin.

But soon, his phone rang again.

He hesitated for a moment, then apologized to Victoria and Alvin and stepped aside to take the call.

Victoria saw the caller ID: Hannah Wright.

###chapter 197 How Are You Here

Hannah must be the stunning woman who had dined with Samuel at the restaurant that day.

Victoria hesitated for a moment but decided to trust Samuel and let him make his own choice.

If he thought Hannah was a better match for him, Victoria wouldn't stand in the way. After all, when it comes to matters of the heart, there's no right or wrong, only what feels right.

Samuel finished his call and smiled awkwardly at Victoria. "Mr. Carter, Victoria, I gotta go now. I'll visit you another day."

Victoria nodded. "Drive safe."

Alvin saw Samuel out and then returned to the living room.

Within two minutes, Victoria received a message from Samuel: [Victoria, don't get the wrong idea. Ms. Wright is with my parents. My dad's not feeling well, so I need to go check on him.]

Victoria felt a warmth in her heart as she read the message and smiled slightly. She replied naturally: [I didn't think much of it.]

In truth, he didn't need to explain anything.

Because no matter what decision Samuel made, Victoria would support him.

Samuel saw her reply and breathed a sigh of relief.

Early that morning, Hannah had been invited over by Primrose and Elmer.

Samuel had come to Victoria's partly to spend the holiday with her and partly to avoid Hannah.

But with Elmer's heart condition, as a son, he had to go back, whether it was serious or not.

Not long after Samuel left, Wendy came home.

Her dad was out with his mistress and illegitimate child again, leaving her mom alone.

She couldn't stay out too long, worried her mom might do something drastic.

For dinner, Alvin prepared a feast, and the father-daughter duo enjoyed it immensely.

After dinner, Victoria cleaned up the dishes and washed the kitchenware.

"Victoria, some business partners invited me to play poker. I'll be out for a while. You should get to bed early," Alvin advised.

Victoria grinned. "Got it. Win big for us!"

Alvin laughed heartily.

After Alvin left, Victoria curled up on the couch, flipping through TV channels out of boredom.

Before long, her phone rang.

The caller was Robert, someone she hadn't heard from in a while.

"Victoria, happy Easter," Robert said.

"Robert, happy Easter. What made you call me out of the blue?" Victoria asked.

Robert sounded a bit uneasy. "Victoria, I took on a case abroad and can't make it back today. Could you check on my mom? She's feeling a bit lonely."

Victoria agreed immediately. "No problem, Robert. I'll head over now."

"Thank you," Robert said.

"Don't mention it. Elara took such good care of me before. It's the least I can do," Victoria replied.

After a bit more small talk, they hung up.

Victoria quickly gathered some things and took a cab to Elara's house.

Elara was delighted to see Victoria. "Victoria, what a surprise! Come in, come in."

"Robert's busy with work, so he asked me to keep you company," Victoria explained.

Elara frowned. "That boy, always troubling others."

Victoria linked arms with Elara, smiling. "Elara, even if Robert hadn't asked, I wanted to see you. It's been too long."

Elara beamed. "Really? I've missed you too!"

Victoria took out the fruits she brought and placed them on the table. She pulled up a chair next to Elara, and they chatted while watching TV.

They talked until Elara grew sleepy, and Victoria got up to leave.

Before she left, Elara seemed hesitant, as if she had something to say but couldn't.

Sensing this, Victoria asked softly, "Elara, is there something you want to tell me?"

After a moment of thought, Elara looked at Victoria. "Victoria, you should go upstairs and see. The apartment you used to rent is now occupied by William. He insisted on buying it at a high price."

Victoria was stunned, her face changing color.

William living in that tiny apartment?

"Elara, are you sure he's here?"

Elara sighed. "I'm not certain, but you should check it out."

With mixed emotions, Victoria headed upstairs.

Standing outside her old apartment, Victoria hesitated.

It was in this very room that she learned about Alvin's involvement in William's parents' deaths and that Alvin's imprisonment was his doing.

William had tormented her to get back at Alvin.

That day, Victoria had truly hated him.

But later, William nearly lost his life saving Alvin.

These tangled events left Victoria confused.

She couldn't love him, but she couldn't muster the hate either.

"What are you doing here?" A deep voice startled her. 

She turned quickly to see William's almost perfect face. "What are you doing here?"

"Just getting some fresh air," he said, adding, "This is my home now."

In other words, whatever he was doing here, it was perfectly normal.

"And you?" William asked, looking directly into her eyes.

Victoria couldn't bring herself to ask, "Why are you living in my old apartment?"

Feeling awkward, she saw William tilt his head slightly, watching her quietly. Then he smiled and took her arm. "I haven't had dinner yet. Will you join me?"

"Um... Okay."

Victoria felt a pang of regret as soon as she said it.

What was she doing?

She had firmly told Alice she had nothing to do with him, yet here she was, having dinner with him.

But Victoria wasn't one to dwell on such things. Since she was already here, she might as well have dinner with an old friend.

It wasn't a big deal.

With that thought, Victoria felt more at ease.

As she entered, she noticed the apartment looked almost the same as when she lived there.

Even the scattered shoes, paintings, and various decorations were still there.

Seeing the familiar room, Victoria felt a moment of disorientation, as if nothing had changed, yet everything had.

"What are you standing there for? Change your shoes and come in," William called from the living room, holding a bottle of expensive red wine.

Victoria snapped out of it.

Even if the furnishings hadn't changed, the lifestyle certainly had.

She put on the slippers and sat at the dining table.

The table was laden with luxurious foods: lobster, king crab, foie gras, caviar-stuffed snails, and more.

Victoria swallowed and remarked, "The life of the rich is extravagant. Can you eat all this by yourself?"

William glanced at her without answering.

What could he say?

Should he tell her he had hoped she would join him for the holiday?

Though he knew it was unlikely, he had still prepared all this food, holding onto a sliver of hope.

And she had come.

William lowered his eyes, hiding the fleeting joy within.

###chapter 198 Indescribable Emotions

Victoria casually picked up the remote and turned on some music, selecting a soothing and lively classical piece. The melodious tunes filled the room, adding a touch of warmth to this Easter evening.

William glanced at her, a faint smile playing on his lips. "You've got quite the sense of ambiance."

"With good food and wine, how could we not enjoy some music? You don't get it; this is an artist's pursuit," Victoria explained earnestly.

"An artist, huh?" William scoffed, taking a sip from his wine glass.

Victoria pouted. "Why can't I be an artist? Plenty of people like my paintings."

"Alright, enough bragging." William pushed a glass of wine towards her. "Try this."

Victoria inhaled the rich aroma of the wine and praised, "Smells wonderful!"

"Then drink up," William said indifferently.

Victoria took a small sip, savoring it before exclaiming, "This is excellent wine!"

They continued their dinner under the soft glow of the chandelier, which cast a gentle light over them, creating a cozy atmosphere.

William suddenly put down his utensils and looked at her. "Happy Easter."

Victoria was momentarily stunned but then broke into a bright smile. "Happy Easter."

"I didn't expect you to come, so I didn't prepare a gift."

"No worries, I did." Victoria pulled a small, intricately decorated Easter egg from her bag and gently slid it across the table. "Hope you like it."

William paused, his gaze fixed on the egg. It was the first time he had received such a unique gift.

He picked up the egg, examining it with curiosity. "For me?"

"Yes," Victoria replied, a bit shyly, lowering her eyes. She had thought that perhaps no one would give him an Easter gift, so she had impulsively bought the egg and kept it with her.

William carefully placed the egg in a delicate box and closed the lid. "It's just an egg," Victoria said, feeling a bit embarrassed.

He shook his head. "It's precious."

Precious enough that he didn't know what to give in return.

Soon, the distant chimes of a church bell echoed through the quiet night, completing the Easter evening tradition.

The two of them were so harmonious tonight, like old friends simply sharing a meal, that Victoria almost forgot the past conflicts she had experienced in this house.

As she was enjoying her meal, her phone rang.

She wiped her hands and answered, "Samuel, what's up?"

William glanced at her, his expression unreadable.

Samuel had just finished celebrating with his family and called her, wanting to hear her voice and chat for a bit. But after a few minutes, he was called away again.

"One of our family friends got drunk, and my dad wants me to drive them home," Samuel explained apologetically.

"Alright, drive safe," Victoria said, hanging up.

When she looked up, she saw William staring at her intently.

"What's going on with you and that guy?" he asked, his tone full of disdain.

"His name is Samuel," Victoria corrected seriously.

"Whatever his name is, it doesn't matter. Victoria, let me tell you, if a guy keeps giving you empty promises, you're not far from being let down."

"Don't talk about him like that. He's not that kind of person. He's never given me empty promises."

In fact, it was she who occasionally kept things from him, and she felt guilty about it.

Seeing her defend Samuel, William scoffed, his voice growing colder. "So what kind of person is he? Sneaking around with other women behind your back?"

Victoria was shocked. "How do you know?"

She regretted the question as soon as she asked it.

William glanced at her. "So you knew all along."

Victoria looked away, speaking softly. "We're all adults. We're not married, so we have the right to make our own choices."

"So, coming to see me behind his back is just following adult rules?" William asked, his tone mocking.

"You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?" Victoria glared at him.

"Victoria, are you really that naive?" William's deep eyes bore into hers. "He's treating you so poorly, and it'll only get worse."

"He..."

Seeing her about to defend Samuel again, William's anger flared. "The person I care about is being treated like this by him?"

Victoria was stunned.

She stared at him, momentarily forgetting how to react, and downed a large glass of wine in one go.

William wasn't one to mince words. He said what he felt without regret.

He even spoke with a hint of arrogance, his tone leaving no room for doubt. "Are you a pushover or just stupid? If you know he's seeing other women, why not confront him? With me here, what are you afraid of? The Brown family? I can crush them easily."

His words seemed light, but Victoria knew he had the power to back them up.

However, what shocked her the most was his admission of caring about her.

Victoria was reluctant to admit the complicated relationship she had with William.

She didn't have Stockholm syndrome or a masochistic tendency. She had once had a naive crush on William, harboring girlish fantasies about a future with him.

She hated his past actions but understood the reasons behind his change in behavior.

In those moments when she was almost swallowed by life's difficulties, it was often William who silently stood by her side, offering a helping hand.

So, she didn't want to face her growing feelings for William, nor did she dare to acknowledge the subtle, inexplicable attraction between them.

It felt like they were destined by fate to either be bitter enemies or strangers passing by.

If they tried to break free from this predetermined path and defy societal norms to be together, not only would others judge them, but she would also fall into deep self-loathing and disgust.

In the end, she pretended not to hear William's words.

After a suffocating silence, Victoria poured herself another full glass of wine and spoke firmly. "This is my personal matter. I don't want anyone interfering."

Her words were decisive, leaving no room for argument.

William let out a cold laugh, seemingly unconcerned with her opinion. He said nothing more and finished his half-full glass of wine.

The two of them, as if in a silent contest, continued to drink in silence, neither willing to back down.

The elegant piano music flowed, evoking a sense of tranquility, yet it only highlighted the tense atmosphere between them.

Time passed, and the food on the table remained mostly untouched, while three or four bottles of wine were emptied. Both of their faces were flushed, their eyes hazy and unfocused.

###chapter 199 Drunken Passion

Victoria shook her head, trying to stay somewhat clear-headed.

She looked at the empty bottles on the table and thought, 'I might really get drunk tonight.'

Just then, William suddenly grabbed her slender, cold wrist and pulled her into his arms.

His warm, moist breath, mixed with the strong smell of alcohol, brushed against her ear as he spoke in a low, husky voice, "Victoria."

Victoria's alcohol-clouded mind couldn't make out what he was saying. She tried to push him away a few times but couldn't, so she just let him hold her.

Before long, they both tumbled onto the soft couch.

Victoria felt her body getting hotter. She pushed at William, mumbling, "William, let go of me. I'm so hot."

William held her down, his rough thumb gently tracing her delicate skin, his eyes dark and intense. "I'm hot too," he murmured.

Victoria squirmed a bit but couldn't escape the heat of his breath on her skin. She struggled for a moment, then gave up, lying obediently on the couch. With the last bit of her rationality, she mumbled, "Don't do anything crazy."

Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes sparkling, and her long lashes fluttered like butterfly wings, tempting him closer.

William's throat tightened as he gazed at her with burning eyes.

They were so close, their noses almost touching, their breaths mingling intimately.

He slowly moved to her lips, capturing her soft, inviting mouth, exploring and tasting her.

His hot breath on her sensitive neck made her shiver.

Victoria couldn't help but tremble, trying to avoid him but unable to. She looked at him through hazy eyes and called his name, "William?"

William stopped and looked at her.

The bright lights illuminated her cute, delicate features, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears, captivating him.

Her cheeks were pink, flushed from the alcohol.

William's eyes darkened. He held her waist with one hand and slipped the other under her nightgown, gently caressing her breasts through the fabric.

Victoria let out a soft moan, her legs trembling slightly, her body pressing against his firm abdomen, melting into him.

William leaned down, biting her earlobe, and asked in a low voice, "Victoria, do you like me?"

"Yes..."

Before she could finish, his tongue traced the edge of her ear, licking every inch of her sensitive skin.

Victoria's body tingled from his sudden intimacy, and she instinctively clutched his shirt.

William's lips moved to her neck, leaving light marks. Victoria couldn't help but moan, her body shivering as if electrified.

"Do you like it?" William asked again, his voice even huskier, his hand moving up her side, touching her through her thin underwear.

Victoria was panting, tears streaming down her face. She shook her head desperately, sobbing, "No, don't do this."

"Don't do what?" His voice was even more seductive, filled with temptation.

William's fingers teased her nipples while his other hand squeezed her buttocks, making her shiver.

Victoria felt her whole body burning, a strange sensation spreading inside her. She whimpered, "William."

Her voice was so alluring that it ignited a fire in William, his arousal becoming unbearable.

William suddenly unzipped her dress, pulling down her underwear, and eagerly entered her.

Their bodies fit together perfectly, her tight, wet warmth enveloping him completely.

Victoria felt full and stretched, their bodies pressed tightly together, as if he wanted to push even deeper.

She cried softly, her voice broken.

William held her tightly, whispering with satisfaction, "Victoria, can you feel it? I'm all the way in."

He began to move, each thrust pulling at her soft flesh, making her even wetter.

His movements brought indescribable pleasure.

Victoria's body trembled, her head thrown back in helpless gasps.

William kissed her neck, gripping her buttocks and thrusting deeper, hitting a spot inside her that made her tighten around him, her thighs trembling.

He continued to hit that spot, and soon Victoria's cries turned into soft, breathy moans.

When she didn't respond, he thrust even harder, hitting her sensitive spot repeatedly.

Pleasure spread from her core to her spine, making Victoria's toes curl and her chest heave.

William grabbed one of her breasts, his rough fingers rubbing her nipple, making it swell and ache.

The mix of pain and pleasure made her tighten around him even more.

Her wet heat gripped him tightly, and William bit her lip, stealing her breath. After several thrusts, he released his hot, thick seed deep inside her.

Victoria's body shuddered from the heat, his length still pulsing inside her.

William held her close, his breathing heavy with satisfaction.

Victoria was dizzy from his kisses, her body limp and exhausted.

He kissed her cheek lightly, his voice hoarse and magnetic, "I love you."

Victoria, dazed by his breath, couldn't hear him clearly.

She only vaguely sensed him saying, "I love you, Victoria."

***

When Victoria woke up, it was just before dawn.

The space beside her was empty.

Victoria rubbed her aching head, pulled off the blanket, and got up to wash.

They had drunk a lot last night, and she couldn't remember what happened after they passed out.

But she felt clean and fresh, so nothing too crazy must have happened, right? Victoria thought, relieved.

She quickly got dressed and hurried home.

Luckily, Alvin had gotten drunk with friends last night and was still asleep, unaware that Victoria hadn't come home.

Otherwise, she would have faced a scolding.

She went back to bed for a bit.

She hadn't slept long when voices at the door woke her.

Samuel had come early to take her to his place.

"Are you really taking me to your house?" Victoria looked at Samuel with sincere eyes.

###chapter 200 You Break Up with Him

"Yeah," Samuel's eyes were firm, "I need to give you a proper commitment."

"But Samuel, I trust you. You don't have to go through all this."

Samuel looked out the window, lost in thought for a moment. Then he turned back to her, speaking earnestly, "Victoria, we've been through a lot to get here. I know you trust me, but some things need more than just feelings. I need to show you my commitment, to let everyone know you're the most important person to me. So, I have to do that."

His eyes, usually bright and gentle, were now serious and determined.

Victoria was taken aback for a moment before she finally nodded. It felt like saying "no" would pull him into an abyss.

"You knew I met with someone else, and you didn't even ask about it! Victoria, do you really care about me?"

"Of course I do..."

"Then come meet my parents!"

Victoria bit her lip and nodded slightly, "I understand."

She knew deep down whether Samuel's feelings had changed. Since she decided to be with him, she was willing to respect his decisions and stand by his side. That was her role as his girlfriend.

Bringing Victoria to meet his parents was a big deal.

Primrose was kind, at least on the surface, always polite to Victoria.

But Elmer wasn't one for pretense. Maybe because of work stress, he looked even more grim and tired, his face showing clear displeasure and annoyance.

After welcoming Victoria into the living room, Primrose smiled and said, "Samuel, come help me in the kitchen."

Samuel frowned, "I'd rather stay here with Victoria for a bit."

"You can chat later. Come help me first."

Samuel was about to refuse, but Victoria gently tugged at his sleeve, "Go ahead, I'll be fine."

Samuel frowned slightly, a hint of reluctance in his eyes. He knew it wasn't ideal to leave Victoria alone with Elmer.

But seeing the hopeful look in Primrose's eyes, he thought maybe this was a chance to ease the tension.

After a brief moment of thought, he gently patted Victoria's shoulder, "Victoria, I'll be right back. If you feel uncomfortable, just let me know, and I'll take you home."

Victoria smiled softly, "Go on."

Elmer heard everything and snorted heavily, "Your mom is waiting for you. Stop dawdling and get in there!"

Samuel frowned slightly, taking a deep breath to calm himself.

He stepped forward, standing in front of Victoria, and said calmly, "Dad, I understand your concerns, but Victoria is the one I've chosen. My feelings for her are not a passing whim."

He stood tall, his gaze unwavering as he looked Elmer in the eye.

Elmer's face showed a flash of anger, but he held it back, saying in a low voice, "Fine, I understand."

Samuel frowned again before slowly walking into the kitchen.

Victoria looked up at Elmer, the awkward silence between them almost suffocating her.

"Ms. Carter, I don't mean to target you, but you and Samuel are not suitable for each other." Elmer's sharp gaze fell directly on her, "Your past with William can be seen as youthful indiscretion. But our family is traditional; we won't accept a daughter-in-law with unclear relationships with another man."

His voice was low and cold, offering no quarter.

Though she had anticipated this, hearing the blunt "you're not suitable" still felt like a punch to the gut for Victoria, leaving her heart aching.

"I know Samuel likes you a lot. No matter how we try to dissuade him, he's determined to be with you. So, Ms. Carter, I hope you can understand our concerns as parents. We hope you will leave him voluntarily. You don't have to break up immediately; give him some time to accept it. After a while, you can say your feelings have faded or that you've found someone else. That way, it will be easier for him to move on."

Victoria stared at him, stunned. Elmer's words showed no regard for her feelings or dignity, as if everything he said was perfectly justified.

She understood that parents favored their own children, but did that mean she deserved to be treated so poorly?

"Ms. Carter, I know this request is excessive, but we've made our stance clear before. If you insist on staying, you must bear the consequences. Frankly, we prefer Hannah. In terms of family background, ability, and manners, she is far more suitable for Samuel than you. A relationship without parental blessing is unlikely to end well. No matter how many promises Samuel makes now, who can guarantee he won't change in a few years? When that time comes, will he return to his family or stay with you, the one who caused the rift? Ms. Carter, you're a smart person. I'm sure you understand."

Victoria sat in the Brown family's living room, feeling utterly devalued, unable to utter a single word in rebuttal.

Elmer's words were harsh but realistic.

She didn't want Samuel to be estranged from his family because of her. Even if it came to that, could she give him the same deep love in return?

Could she?

"Ms. Carter, I won't let you sacrifice in vain. I know your father's company is just starting to grow. I'll do my best to help his business, improving your lives significantly. Of course, you don't have to answer right away. Take your time to consider."

Without waiting for her response, Elmer checked his watch, "Today, Hannah and her parents are also coming over. If you want to stay for lunch, that's fine, but it might be awkward to introduce you. We don't mind; as long as you don't, it's fine."

If Elmer had been deliberately difficult or verbally abusive, Victoria could have mustered the courage to fight back. But his cold, business-like demeanor, discussing pros and cons without considering her feelings, left her feeling insignificant.

If she still insisted on staying, it would only prove to the Wright family how desirable Samuel was and made her look like she was trying to climb a ladder she couldn't reach.

Victoria felt the stark reality.

She had been too naive, thinking a boyfriend who made her feel comfortable and compatible was enough. Samuel's kindness had indeed moved her.

But Elmer's blunt reality check deflated her courage and made her want to retreat.

She couldn't bear to make Samuel turn against his parents for her.

Moreover, to win his parents' favor, she would have to humble herself, which went against her nature.

After talking with Elmer, she wanted to back out.

Elmer, having said his piece, got up and left.

Soon, Samuel hurried out of the kitchen, looking anxious, worried that Elmer had been harsh with her.

He quickly walked to her side, bending down to ask gently, "What did my dad say to you?"

"Nothing much, just some small talk."

Victoria paused for a moment, then said softly, "I suddenly don't feel like staying for the meal."

###chapter 201 You Don't Care?

Victoria kept her head down, avoiding his gaze, her fingers nervously tugging at the hem of her shirt, clearly uneasy.

To Samuel, she looked like she had been wronged.

Seeing that Victoria didn't want to say more, he didn't press further. He sighed softly, took off his jacket, and draped it over her shoulders. "Alright, I'll take you home."

She wanted to refuse, knowing that Hannah was coming over soon, and it wouldn't be proper if he wasn't there to greet her.

But Samuel's face was stern as he grabbed their coats, gave a few quick instructions to the housekeeper, and hurried out with her.

As their car was about to leave the gates of The Brown Villa, it passed by the Wright family's car.

Victoria glanced out the window and saw Hannah.

"She's the Ms. Wright you met at the restaurant the other day, right?"

A flicker of embarrassment crossed Samuel's face before he regained his composure. "Yeah, her name's Hannah."

Victoria nodded slightly. "She's very pretty."

"You saw her, and you don't feel never mind." Samuel felt a tightness in his chest, like something was blocking his breath.

Hannah also noticed his car, her gaze lingering on it briefly, a hint of confusion in her eyes.

"Dad, stop the car!" Hannah's clear voice rang out.

Her father immediately hit the brakes.

Hannah pushed open the door and, like a nimble deer, ran to the roadside, waving her arms energetically. "Samuel! Samuel!"

Her voice was particularly loud in the crisp early spring air, filled with a mix of girlish charm and anticipation.

By this time, Samuel's car had already driven a short distance from The Brown Villa's gate.

Seeing this, Victoria quickly said, "Samuel, stop the car."

"What for?" Samuel turned his head slightly, a hint of displeasure in his expression, his brows furrowing. "You know who she is, but you don't seem to care?"

Victoria understood that the Wright family had connections with the Brown family, so they were all coming to visit today.

Victoria had to think about Samuel's position and not make things difficult for him, despite her awkwardness.

While she was thinking, Hannah had already run over.

Samuel remained seated in the driver's seat, his back straight, unmoved.

Victoria couldn't pretend not to see. She rolled down the window and offered a polite smile. "Ms. Wright, hello."

Hannah's eyes flashed with a quick, fleeting surprise. She glanced at Victoria briefly, then smiled back with a simple, "Hi."

Then she turned her attention to Samuel, asking enthusiastically, "Samuel, are you going out?"

"Yeah." Samuel responded absentmindedly, glancing at her briefly, his expression clearly saying, "I don't want to deal with you right now."

"When will you be back? I'll wait for you!" Hannah asked warmly, seemingly oblivious to his coldness.

"Is there something you need?" Samuel's voice was deep and rich, tinged with emotion. He was still upset about Victoria's earlier indifference.

"Nothing much, just wanted to chat with you." Hannah was slightly taken aback, probably not expecting Samuel to be so unkind.

She then looked at Victoria, her gaze inscrutable.

Victoria knew that Hannah was affected by her presence, but it wasn't the right time to address it. She lowered her voice and gently chided Samuel, "Be nicer to Ms. Wright. She's a girl, don't make her feel uncomfortable."

Samuel sighed softly, as if resigned to Victoria's kindness, or perhaps convincing himself to let go of his emotions.

Samuel adjusted his posture slightly, turned to face Hannah, and put on a polite smile. "Ms. Wright, what I meant was, I'm really busy today and probably won't have time. Don't wait up for me."

Though his words were perfunctory, Hannah smiled again upon hearing his explanation. "Alright, we'll chat another time."

Before leaving, she playfully waved at him. "I'll be waiting for your call."

She looked every bit like a girl in love.

Before leaving, she gave Victoria a thoughtful glance.

Samuel stepped on the gas, and the car sped away.

Inside the car, Victoria knew what he was upset about. After a moment of silence, she cautiously looked at him and said softly, "It's not that I don't care. I just have faith in you, so I didn't question you. I believe you have your reasons."

"You have so much faith in me, I should be happy, right? But no matter how much faith you have, knowing your boyfriend is meeting another woman, you should still be a little upset, right?" Samuel said, though her words warmed his heart, and his grip on the steering wheel relaxed slightly.

"If you understand that, then why did you go? No matter the reason, meeting another woman when you have a girlfriend isn't good for either of us, right?" Victoria tilted her chin slightly, her gaze stubborn.

Samuel was momentarily speechless, opening his mouth but saying nothing.

After a moment, he shook his head lightly, as if mocking his own actions or marveling at Victoria's perceptiveness.

During a red light, he gently ruffled her hair, his touch tender and affectionate. "Now you're finally acting like a girlfriend."

There was a hint of a smile in his voice, as if the earlier tension had dissipated.

Victoria huffed, pretending to be angry. "I'm understanding, and you don't appreciate it? Fine, let's hurt each other then!"

"Yes, yes, it's my fault. I shouldn't have met another woman behind my dear girlfriend's back." Samuel apologized, but there was a hint of pride on his face, feeling pleased that she cared about him.

Back at The Carter Villa, Victoria urged him to go back.

"You're so eager for me to go back and see her?" Samuel's tone was calm, but the slight rise in his voice betrayed his emotions.

Victoria couldn't help but smile. She said softly, "It's basic courtesy and represents your family's hospitality. Besides, would you do anything to betray me?"

"Of course not!" Samuel denied without hesitation.

Victoria smiled and said, "So, what are you worried about?"

Samuel stared at her face, then suddenly leaned in and kissed her on the lips, quickly pulling back with a satisfied smile.

Victoria was stunned for a moment, her face turning red. She playfully slapped him a few times. "You rascal, get going!"

"Bye-bye!" Samuel winked at her before stepping on the gas and driving away.

Victoria stood there, watching the taillights fade into the distance, lost in thought.

After a while, she turned to unlock the door.

To her surprise, she heard familiar voices inside.

"Alvin, please help us! For the sake of our years together, help Bobby and me. I have no other options." Nora's voice was trembling with tears.

"Dad, even though I'm not your biological son, we've been family for years. Please help me.. I don't want to go back to prison. It's unbearable there. I beg you!" Bobby's voice was even more desperate.

Bobby?

Victoria was shocked.

Wasn't he in prison? How did he get out?

###chapter 202 Medical Parole

Victoria had been eavesdropping for a while before she finally pieced together that Bobby had been granted medical parole to donate a kidney to Nora.

What a sneaky move!

Victoria's lips twisted into a mocking smile. She didn't buy for a second that Nora would actually let Bobby go through with the donation.

It was just a temporary fix.

Sure enough, Bobby soon started whining, each word more pitiful and dramatic than the last.

"What do you need help with? Why don't you just tell me?" Victoria strode into the living room, breaking the awkward silence.

In the living room, Nora and Bobby were sitting on the couch, looking pretty downcast.

Bobby had a fresh buzz cut and was dressed in simple, loose clothing. He looked much thinner and more worn out, a far cry from his former self.

He seemed especially cautious and quiet, a stark contrast to his previous arrogance.

Nora sat beside him, occasionally dabbing at her eyes with a tissue, looking as if she had suffered a great injustice.

Alvin sat across from them, his face dark and silent.

Hearing Victoria's voice, Bobby's body trembled slightly before he quickly lowered his head, as if ashamed to meet her gaze.

"Victoria, you're back." Nora glanced at her and greeted her indifferently.

After the last suicide incident, Nora's heart had turned cold. She now saw Victoria as being in cahoots with that wretched Daisy.

"I'm still your mother. When you see me, shouldn't you at least ask how I'm doing? Even if you don't like me or acknowledge me as your mother, blood ties can't be severed." Nora felt disgruntled.

Victoria paused for a moment, then said in a flat tone, "How are you feeling?"

Though Victoria asked out of obligation, Nora acted as if she hadn't heard, her gaze drifting elsewhere, ignoring her.

Victoria sat down next to Alvin. "Dad, you've been catching up with them for a while now. You must be tired. Why don't you go upstairs and rest? I'll handle things here."

Alvin gave her a deep look. "Can you manage?"

She smiled faintly, her expression calm. "It's just entertaining guests. What's so difficult about that? I'm not a clueless child anymore. I've seen my fair share of these complicated dealings."

Guests?

Nora bit her lip and glared at her hatefully upon hearing this.

"Alright then." Alvin didn't want to get entangled with Nora any further. He stood up immediately, his steps hurried, not even bothering with a polite farewell.

"Alvin! I'm not done talking. You can't leave!" Nora, panicking, tried to get up and stop him.

Victoria stepped in front of Nora with a smile.

"Get out of my way!" Nora snapped at her angrily.

"Mom, I suggest you sit down and talk to me, your daughter. After all, I'm the one who was victimized by Bobby's crimes." Victoria's tone was equally indifferent.

Nora turned to glare at her, gritting her teeth, and hissed, "Don't think that just because your father is back, you have someone to back you up. Let me tell you, I've been married to him for years. Sooner or later, we'll reconcile and be as good as new!"

Victoria lowered her eyes, a mocking smile playing on her lips. She chuckled softly, "Just cut to the chase. Why are you really here?"

She then turned her sharp gaze to Bobby. "And you, how did you manage to get out of prison so quickly?"

Her words dripped with sarcasm, making Bobby's face flush red. The arrogance and swagger he once had were long gone. Now, he looked down, speaking timidly, "I'm on medical parole to donate a kidney to Mom."

"Really?" Victoria raised an eyebrow, her eyes full of amusement. "I remember when they did the matching tests before, they said your kidney wasn't a match. How did it suddenly become a match after a few months in prison?"

Her feigned surprise infuriated Nora.

"Victoria, watch your tone! How can you talk to Bobby like that?" Nora scolded.

Victoria glanced at Nora, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Does he deserve my respect? This shameless bastard."

Seeing Nora about to retort, Bobby gently tugged at her sleeve, speaking softly, "Mom, I understand why Victoria is angry with me. I acted impulsively before and hurt her. It's understandable that she's still upset and doesn't want to talk to me. Please, calm down."

As Bobby spoke, his eyes reddened, as if he genuinely cared about Victoria.

Victoria sighed inwardly. Bobby's acting was quite good, but she had seen too many of these fake acts growing up.

Sure enough, Nora immediately patted his hand, comforting him, "Alright, let's not bring up the past. She's already had you locked up for months. She should be over it by now. How long does she plan to hold a grudge? What more does she want?"

Then, she looked at Victoria, her eyes full of resentment, her tone commanding, "I came here for one thing. You need to paint a few pictures for Bobby. First, to publicly announce that you two have reconciled; second, so he can use a new pen name and make a fresh start in the art world."

Bobby kept his head down, waiting obediently for Victoria's response.

Victoria resisted the urge to roll her eyes.

So she was supposed to be the one to suffer?

"Why should I?" Victoria sounded as if she had heard the most ridiculous thing. "Are you two out of your minds? Is your brain foggy, or did I hear wrong?"

She pointed at Bobby. "He locked me up, tortured me, and nearly killed me! And you want me to paint for him so he can re-enter the art world? Mom, are you crazy?"

Bobby bit his lip, his eyes reddening, and stammered, "I was in a bad mental state back then. I didn't know what I was doing."

"So, you're saying you have a mental illness?"

"Yeah, I was diagnosed."

Victoria let out a cold laugh, mercilessly mocking him. "If your brain is sick, why be an artist? You should stay in prison and stop causing trouble!"

Bobby opened his mouth, looking to Nora for help.

Nora's eyes widened in anger, shouting, "Victoria! How can you say that? He's your brother!"

Victoria had secretly turned on her camera when she entered the room, recording their conversation.

If it weren't for wanting to capture their ugly faces on record, she wouldn't have wasted her breath on them.

###chapter 203 Unreasonable

Nora noticed Victoria's silence and assumed she had given in.

She commanded, "I've already talked to your dad. His design company has some connections in the art world, so we'll start by setting up an exhibition for Bobby. Once his legal issues are sorted out, he'll change his name and start fresh. With you painting for him, he'll be famous again in no time!"

Bobby kept glancing at Victoria, his eyes full of hope. "Dad's company might be small, but with Professor Brown's help, we'll be fine."

"Exactly," Nora said, looking at Bobby with a doting expression. "Bobby was born to be an artist. A little setback is nothing. We'll bounce back! Plus, signing with your dad's company is also a way to support him."

Nora continued, her tone condescending, like a seasoned art critic, "If we hire a new artist, it would take a lot of time and money upfront, with no guarantee of success. But Bobby's already got a lot of buzz, so we can save a ton on marketing!"

Victoria listened to their self-serving conversation in silence for a while before finally speaking up. "Bobby, I thought after everything that happened, you'd have learned something. But you're still just as unreasonable!"

She paused, muttering, "But with a mom like that spoiling you, it's no wonder."

Nora, used to being domineering in front of Victoria, didn't think she needed to be polite to get her to do something. Her tone grew even more forceful. "This time, the painting has to be better than your previous works. I know you can do it, and Bobby has the talent. This has to be perfect!"

Bobby, fired up by her words, his eyes shining and cheeks flushed, said, "Mom, I won't let you down!"

Victoria watched the mother and son duo, stunned. She hadn't even agreed, and they were already planning their success?

She pressed her lips together, glaring at them coldly for a moment before suddenly laughing. "You two are dreaming!"

Victoria had had enough. She knew that arguing with them was just a waste of time and would only make her more upset.

"You're kicking me out before I even finish talking? Victoria! Is this how I raised you?"

"Mom, don't get upset. It's not good for your health," Bobby reminded.

"Look at her, treating me like an enemy. How can I not be angry?"

Victoria grabbed a decorative item from the table and smashed it on the ground.

Bobby and Nora jumped, staring at her in shock.

"Get out! Stop causing trouble here!" Victoria shouted.

With that, she stormed upstairs, leaving a stunned Nora and Bobby behind.

***

A few days later, a video of Nora and Bobby pressuring Victoria to paint for them started circulating in the art community.

Though the video was shot from a clever angle that didn't show their faces, the conversation made it clear who they were. Those familiar with the situation quickly identified Nora and Bobby, turning them into a laughingstock.

Bobby had previously stolen Victoria's painting to win a silver award in a competition and then falsely claimed that her gold-winning piece was his. When this deceit was exposed, he even kidnapped and imprisoned Victoria.

Bobby's crime of kidnapping was serious, and getting medical parole was already a lenient act. Expecting the victim to help him make a comeback was pure fantasy!

And Nora, as a mother, had no boundaries in her favoritism towards Bobby. She brought him to Victoria's home, demanding she paint to help his comeback. It was sheer madness!

The internet was flooded with insults and ridicule.

Harry watched the edited funny video, laughing so hard he didn't notice William walking out of his office.

"What's so funny?" William asked, his voice cutting through Harry's laughter.

"Just a funny video," Harry replied, quickly trying to hide his phone when he realized who was standing there.

William had been particularly sensitive to the name "Victoria" lately, and any mention of her put him in a foul mood. So, Harry definitely didn't want him to see this video.

William didn't say a word, just extended his hand.

Harry hesitated for a moment before reluctantly handing over his phone.

William looked down at the screen, hearing Nora's arrogant tone in the video. His brow furrowed, and he spoke coldly, "Find out how Bobby got out."

"Yes, sir," Harry replied, quickly taking back his phone, fearing William might smash it in anger.

He then reminded him, "Mr. Scott, there's an important investment seminar this afternoon." 

The highly anticipated investment seminar was held at an exclusive private club in Silvermist City.

Attendees included wealthy businesspeople from across the country, covering a wide range of industries.

The moment William stepped into the banquet hall, he caused quite a stir.

At twenty-eight, dressed in a black suit that highlighted his tall, lean frame, he was strikingly handsome. His deep, narrow eyes were sharp as blades, exuding an intimidating aura.

Both men and women couldn't help but steal glances at him, their eyes filled with admiration.

"Is that the president of the Scott Group? He's so young and handsome, no wonder he's the dream man of so many single women!"

"Yeah, I'd marry him even if I had to pay for it!"

"Dream on! Mr. Scott isn't just any man! He's handsome and capable, with countless admirers. Do you really think you stand a chance?"

"Enough already."

The chatter among the women was incessant.

"Mr. Scott is here!"

Those skilled in socializing immediately put on their most ingratiating smiles, hurrying over to greet him warmly.

The Scott Group, under William's leadership, had been on a meteoric rise in recent years, backed by the powerful Scott family. Their strength was formidable.

In the fiercely competitive business world, everyone was eager to collaborate with the Scott Group, hoping to seize an opportunity to soar.

Alvin was out of town, so Victoria attended the seminar in his place.

Her gaze casually swept across the open-air venue, and she spotted William in the crowd.

Her heart gave a slight, almost imperceptible tremor, but she quickly looked away, maintaining her composure.

Victoria had gained some recognition in the local art scene and was Joshua's only student.

Many fashionable socialites wanted to chat and take pictures with her.

To help promote Alvin's company, Victoria kept a polite smile, patiently engaging with these ladies.

Through the dense crowd, William's gaze occasionally fell on her, his eyes flickering with an unreadable light.

Today, Victoria wore a light purple evening gown with a V-neck design, elegant and noble. A light purple crystal flower adorned her chest, making her look charming and delicate.

Her waist was cinched tightly, accentuating her full, rounded bust.

Already stunningly beautiful, she looked like a blooming rose, captivating and radiant.

William's eyes darkened as he watched her smile and nod at those around her, a sudden, inexplicable irritation rising within him.

###chapter 204 Taking Photos

What is Victoria doing?

She's doing this on purpose!

Dressing up like that just to get his attention?

William couldn't help but frown, feeling more and more disgusted with this seductive version of Victoria.

She was like a poppy flower-he knew he should stay away, yet he couldn't stop himself from being drawn to her.

William's teeth were nearly grinding to dust. He wanted nothing more than to drag her home and lock her away, forbidding any other man from even glancing at her!

"William!" Alice approached him with graceful steps. "I didn't expect you to come in person. I thought you'd send an assistant."

He pulled his gaze away, his expression lazy, his tone as calm as water. "This seminar is crucial for the future of Silvermist City's business landscape. It's important to show some sincerity."

Alice stepped closer, gently tugging at his sleeve and lowering her voice. "That's Andrew McClellan from X-STAR Solutions Inc."

X-STAR Solutions Inc. and the Scott Group were in the middle of critical negotiations. They had reached a preliminary agreement, and after Jerald returned to headquarters, he sent his brother Andrew to handle the follow-up.

William turned his head to see a young, arrogant man striding confidently into the room. Many people around him eagerly approached with smiles and greetings.

Andrew walked into the venue with his head held high, suddenly stopping to stare directly at Victoria in the crowd. "Who's that?"

His secretary followed his gaze and quickly explained, "Her name is Victoria Carter. She used to be Mr. Scott's secretary at the Scott Group. Now she's a somewhat famous artist."

Andrew's interest was piqued, a wicked smile curling on his lips as he strode over to introduce himself. "Ms. Carter, hello! I'm Andrew McClellan from X-STAR Solutions Inc. Jerald is my brother."

Using his brother's name to flaunt his status?

Victoria's lips curved into a polite smile, and she nodded slightly. "Hello, Mr. McClellan."

She had heard of X-STAR Solutions Inc. It had grown rapidly in recent years and gained considerable international recognition.

If she could secure investment from X-STAR Solutions Inc., it would be a huge boost for Alvin's company.

With that in mind, she treated Andrew with even more warmth and sincerity.

"I've admired your artwork for a long time, Ms. Carter! Could we take a photo together?"

"You flatter me, Mr. McClellan. Of course, we can take a photo!" Victoria stepped forward gracefully.

However, she didn't expect Andrew to place his hand on her shoulder and pull her closer.

Her smile froze, and her brow furrowed slightly.

But in such a public setting, if she were to lose her temper abruptly, it would only make her appear petty and lacking in social grace.

She reassured herself that it was just a photo and it would be over soon.

But after looking at the photo his secretary took, Andrew shook his head in disdain. "This one's no good. The lighting is terrible. Let's take another! Make sure it's a good one this time."

He stood next to Victoria again, this time wrapping his arm around her waist and pulling her even closer, a playful smile on his face. "Ms. Carter, you have such a slender waist!"

Victoria's face darkened. She wanted to push him away, but she couldn't make a scene. She had to hold back her anger, resisting the urge to slap him.

Not far away, William was chatting and laughing with some industry bigwigs, seemingly casual, but his eyes were always on Victoria, a cold glint in his gaze.

"Alright, let's take this one. Come on, another shot!" Andrew seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself, changing poses and urging his secretary to keep taking photos.

William suddenly slammed his champagne glass onto the table and said softly, "Excuse me," before turning and striding towards Victoria without hesitation.

"William!" Alice saw everything and quickly followed, her expression anxious. "That's Andrew! Jerald's brother! We can't afford to offend him right now."

William ignored her, deftly unbuttoning his coat and casually rolling up his sleeves, exuding an undeniable sense of authority.

Meanwhile, Victoria had reached her limit. Andrew kept using the excuse of taking photos to harass her, leaning on her and half-hugging her, his hands never staying still.

Victoria used the last of her patience to hold back. "Mr. McClellan, I think we've taken enough photos."

Just as she spoke, she was shocked to see Andrew's hand on her shoulder being forcefully grabbed and flung away by a strong hand.

"Mr. McClellan, I'd like a photo with Ms. Carter too. Are you done yet?" As William spoke, he naturally placed his arm around Victoria's shoulder.

He stood there, tall and relaxed, without any extra intimacy, yet the two of them side by side looked inexplicably harmonious.

A handsome man and a beautiful woman, like something out of a fairy tale.

Victoria looked up at him, lowering her voice. "What are you doing here?"

William didn't look at her, just slightly curled his lips, his voice cold as ice. "If I didn't come, he'd have his hands all over you by now."

Victoria's cheeks flushed instantly. "It's not as bad as you're making it sound."

"Really? So I'm overreacting? Fine, I'll leave then."

William pretended to leave, but Victoria quickly grabbed his coat. "You're already here."

William's lips curled into a mocking smile, and he chuckled softly, his hand gently wrapping around her waist.

Victoria stiffened, her body going rigid. She glared at him, warning him not to push his luck.

Andrew was annoyed by William's interruption but kept a smile on his face. "And you are?"

His secretary quickly stepped forward to introduce him. "Mr. McClellan, this is Mr. Scott, the president of the Scott Group."

So this was the Scott family's head? The one negotiating with Jerald?

Andrew's arrogance grew, his chin practically in the air.

"So, Mr. Scott, you and Ms. Carter are still in touch?"

Victoria didn't deny it. William glanced at her, his tone slow and deliberate. "Yes, we're quite close."

The implication was clear.

A boss and his secretary, with a relationship that invited speculation.

Victoria's face burned, and she glared at him, gritting her teeth.

Andrew's displeasure was evident.

Victoria's face and figure were irresistible to him, especially her full, perky chest, which seemed to captivate him completely.

But William's possessiveness was infuriating. How could he swallow this insult?

###chapter 205 Rekindling Old Feelings

"Mr. Scott, there are a few things in our agreement that I don't really get. Can you clear them up for me?" Andrew asked, forcing a smile while fuming inside.

"Sure." William shot Victoria a look that left no room for argument. "Wait for me over there."

The natural intimacy in his voice made anyone watching wonder about their relationship.

"Okay." Victoria obediently walked to a quieter spot.

Immediately, the sharp-eyed crowd swarmed around her, pretending to make small talk while subtly probing her relationship with William.

Those who initially wanted to cozy up to William now turned their attention to Victoria, hoping to gain an advantage through her.

In no time, a dozen business cards were thrust in front of her like a flurry of snowflakes.

Meanwhile, William listened to Andrew's irrelevant and trivial questions, which didn't even touch on the core points of their cooperation. He grew increasingly impatient, not even bothering to make eye contact. Eventually, Harry stepped in to answer on his behalf.

Holding his wine glass, William occasionally glanced in Victoria's direction.

At first, Victoria managed to handle the attention.

But as more people crowded around her, her brow furrowed, and a hint of helplessness appeared on her face.

William took a sip of his wine, thinking to himself that she shouldn't have been dragged into this complicated scene.

Setting down his glass, he was about to walk over to her when Alice naturally sidled up to him.

She affectionately linked her arm with his, her demeanor intimate. "This is Jonah Clarke, the head of this investment seminar and a key figure in Silvermist City's Department of Commerce."

William looked up to see a middle-aged man approaching them.

"You must be Mr. Scott. So young and accomplished! Alice, you have a good eye!"

The man's compliment was laden with obvious implications.

William wasn't about to waste time explaining such trivial matters. His main goal for attending was to establish a connection with Jonah.

He hadn't expected Alice to have such a close relationship with him.

He glanced at her, realizing he knew less about her than he thought.

Sensing his thoughts, Alice leaned in and whispered, "They only know me because of my aunt."

William knew a bit about Alice's aunt, Catherine Potts. His dealings in Xandria with Louie had gone smoothly partly due to Catherine's help.

The Potts family wasn't a major family, but Catherine had married far better than Alice's mother.

Her husband was from the Bryant family, a prestigious family in Harborview City, comparable to the Scott family.

Though Catherine hadn't married the head of the Bryant family, her husband was the head's younger brother, with significant assets and connections.

Catherine and Alice's mother had been close since childhood, so it was natural for her to dote on Alice.

Recently, Catherine had heard about Alice being trapped abroad by the Garcia family for years. If Ella hadn't donated a kidney to save Alice, Catherine wouldn't have let it go so easily.

William understood that if it was indeed Catherine's influence, it made sense.

Victoria finally had some peace. She instinctively glanced over at William, who was now chatting and laughing with others, Alice clinging to him affectionately.

Alice occasionally adjusted his slightly wrinkled collar with a natural familiarity.

Who would believe they had broken up?

Victoria forced herself to look away. Whether William and Alice rekindled their relationship was none of her business!

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Scott asked me to take you home." Harry appeared in front of her.

"The event isn't over yet," Victoria said.

"Mr. Scott said you might not be comfortable in this setting and shouldn't force yourself."

Victoria turned her head, staring at William in a daze.

William was still mingling with the crowd, Alice clinging to him like a bird, and he didn't seem to mind at all!

"Why does he still care about what I do?" Victoria slowly looked away, her tone carrying a hint of irritation she didn't even notice.

But as soon as she spoke, she realized it sounded like she was upset with a boyfriend or a girl complaining out of jealousy.

Realizing this, her mood worsened, and her rebellious streak flared up. "I'm not leaving! Why should I listen to him? I still need to promote my dad's company!"

"But..." Before Harry could say more, Victoria plunged into the bustling crowd.

This was an investment seminar, and everyone was deep in conversation. Victoria kept her task in mind.

As she promoted her company, people kept offering her drinks. Even though it was just wine, drinking one glass after another made her legs feel weak and her head light.

Her cheeks grew redder, and as someone handed her another glass, a large, well-defined hand suddenly reached over, taking the glass and downing it in one gulp, then turning the empty glass upside down to show it was finished.

"Everyone, is it fun to bully a young lady? If you want to drink, I'll join you." With that, he calmly picked up another glass.

Victoria tilted her head, looking at him in a daze. Perhaps it was the alcohol, but her head leaned against his chest, her consciousness growing fuzzier.

Seeing this, the crowd awkwardly laughed, defusing the tension. Who would dare push Victoria to drink more?

This was William, after all!

Of all people to offend, why him?

William glanced at Victoria, who was leaning against him, her cheeks flushed with a tipsy glow. Her body was limp, as if she might slide to the floor at any moment.

With a hint of exasperation, he wrapped an arm around her waist, supporting her entire weight.

He walked over to Jonah, his face apologetic, and said sincerely, "I'm really sorry, but something came up. She's had a bit too much to drink, and I need to take her home."

Jonah was momentarily stunned, his gaze quickly sweeping over Victoria in William's arms, then glancing at Alice nearby. He smiled warmly, "Of course, Mr. Scott. Take care of your business. We can talk another time."

"Absolutely."

Alice's face turned sour. She had gone to great lengths to help him network, and now he was willing to forgo a significant business opportunity for Victoria!

Despite her frustration and resentment, she suppressed her emotions, quickly catching up with them. She feigned concern, speaking softly, "Ms. Carter had too much to drink? Maybe I should take her home. It's rare to have all the big names in Silvermist City here. Leaving now might not be the best idea."

"No need." William's refusal was firm, "She's not that close to you."

###chapter 206 That's Slander!

He was just stating the obvious. After all, Victoria was completely wasted, and if she passed out on the street, could anyone else be as understanding as he was?

However, Alice felt utterly humiliated by his words, and her smile turned increasingly bitter.

"Are you worried I can't take care of Ms. Carter? Seems like you really care about her. You never treated me like this when we were together. Forget it, I shouldn't have said anything."

Seeing her look so hurt and disappointed, William hesitated slightly and softened his tone. "I mean, you're not strong enough to handle someone who's drunk. It might be too much for you."

"Who says I'm drunk?" Victoria, leaning on his shoulder, suddenly lifted her head and tried to open her eyes wide to prove she was perfectly sober.

Victoria tried to focus on the people around her, but her mind was a mess.

She squinted and finally recognized Alice. Pointing a finger at her, she mumbled warily, "I remember her. She's scary... She always scares me."

William raised an eyebrow slightly, his deep eyes narrowing as he slowly turned to look at Alice.

Alice was stunned, then became furious, her voice rising. "Ms. Carter! What nonsense are you talking about? When have I ever scared you? Just because you're drunk doesn't mean you can spout nonsense and cause trouble!"

Victoria let out a light hum. "You had someone pull Lyanna's clothes in public just because she went to Harborview City with William."

"That's slander!"

"And you said you'd skin me alive," Victoria continued.

"You!"

Alice was practically fuming. "That's a complete lie! When did I ever say that?"

"You did. You were so fierce! I know any woman who gets close to this guy ends up badly." Victoria's slender finger pointed at William's handsome face, poking it repeatedly. "Now you know! I'm scared. I need to stay far away from you so I won't get stripped in the street."

Victoria couldn't tell if this was reality or her imagination, but she poured out everything in her heart, mixing truth and lies.

William was silent for a moment, then thoughtfully said, "So, you want to stay away from me because you're afraid someone will cause you trouble?"

Alice was on the verge of breaking down. "William! You can't seriously believe her nonsense, can you?"

Such childish and ridiculous accusations, like a kid tattling, and he believed it?

William lifted his deep eyes, looking at her with determination. "She doesn't lie."

"You mean she doesn't lie, but I do?" Alice stared at him in disbelief. "In your eyes, I'm the kind of woman she says I am? Is that how you see me?"

Victoria felt the noise around her was overwhelming. She hiccuped and leaned against William's chest, frowning as she continued her accusations. "You are! You are! Let me tell you, you can't do that again. You'll just scare all the men away, just like my mom, Nora."

"Shut up!" Alice was trembling with anger, but considering the situation, she forced herself to lower her voice.

But her scolding of Victoria only made William more displeased. He suppressed his anger. "She's not someone you can yell at."

It wasn't a warning, just a calm statement.

Hearing this, Victoria immediately grabbed his collar, pulling his head down to whisper in his ear, "Don't provoke her. She might retaliate against you later!"

He raised an eyebrow slightly, mimicking her, and whispered in her ear, "She wouldn't dare."

"Okay." Victoria nodded as if she understood, looking like she had learned a lesson.

They were so wrapped up in each other that they completely ignored Alice!

Alice knew William was just placating Victoria and might not truly believe what she said.

But he didn't care about her feelings at all!

"I'm leaving. Harry will take you home later." William said this indifferently, then helped Victoria into the car, got in himself, started the engine, and drove away.

Alice stood there in a daze, watching the car disappear into the distance, her heart feeling like it was being torn apart. 

The black Rolls-Royce drove steadily down the road.

Victoria was half-lying in the seat, her beautiful face flushed with a dreamy red, clearly still drunk.

She rubbed her forehead, her eyes hazy as she looked out the window, mumbling, "So thirsty, so hot."

William remembered the last time in the rental apartment when she was just as enticingly drunk.

He couldn't help but swallow, feeling all the blood in his body rushing to one place, a wave of heat rising from his lower abdomen.

His breathing became a bit erratic, his deep eyes growing darker and more intense. He pressed his lips together and pulled over onto a side road.

He took a blanket from the back seat and covered her, then opened a bottle of water and brought it to her lips.

Victoria instinctively tilted her head back and drank a few gulps, but she drank too quickly and started coughing, tears welling up in her eyes.

William sighed helplessly, pulling her into his arms and patting her back firmly.

Victoria finally stopped coughing, her small face buried in his chest, gasping for breath.

The spilled water soaked a large part of the fabric on her chest, faintly revealing her nipples.

Victoria blinked her clear, watery eyes, looking up at him in a daze.

William's heart raced as he looked at her luscious red lips.

He couldn't hold back any longer and leaned down to kiss her lips.

The soft, warm sensation made Victoria instinctively close her eyes, letting his tongue pry open her teeth and ravage her sweet mouth.

The smell of alcohol mixed with her unique scent lingered in his nose, making him lose himself.

Victoria let out a soft moan, instinctively wrapping her arms around his waist, responding to his kiss.

Her reaction made William even more excited. He tightened his arms around her, wanting to merge with her completely, never to be separated.

Victoria felt dizzy, her body growing weaker, her arms clinging to his neck.

His lips touched her warm skin, igniting a fire wherever they met. Victoria's body trembled more violently, holding him tightly, her waist writhing restlessly.

But this contact only made her crave more, the primal desire almost pulling her into an abyss.

William also noticed her increasingly urgent movements. His large hand reached down between them, feeling her soaking wet panties.

William took a deep breath, turned her over to lie on the seat back, and removed her panties, looking at the fluid between her legs. His throat tightened, and he swallowed hard.

###chapter 207 Taking Advantage of Her

He had already touched her intimately, and only then did a flicker of conscience arise within him. Was he taking advantage of Victoria? If she woke up, would she never speak to him again?

But then he thought that it wasn't the first time he had taken advantage of her.

Without the influence of alcohol, she wouldn't even want to be near him.

He took off his shirt, revealing a well-toned chest with defined muscles.

Victoria, already lost to the effects of alcohol, acted purely on instinct, seeking any form of relief.

William was losing control under her touch.

He hesitated, even pulling his hand back, but Victoria grew more desperate, moving her hips to press against him.

His tip brushed against her inner thigh, grazing her sensitive areas, almost slipping inside.

Her body pressed tightly against the seat, and William's hand found its way to her soft breast, gently kneading it. She moaned involuntarily, her small hands gripping his broad shoulders.

Unable to hold back any longer, William thrust into her, aided by the natural lubrication.

His thick member plunged deep into Victoria, reaching her core.

He hadn't expected her to climax so quickly, her body convulsing around him.

She was so sensitive today.

William held her close, their bodies tightly joined. Before he could move, Victoria's hips began to grind, urging him to thrust inside her.

Driven to the brink, William gripped her hips, matching her movements with deep, powerful thrusts.

Victoria's moans filled the confined space, her breath coming in gasps as she clung to him, drawing endless pleasure from their union.

The car was too cramped, and William worried she might get hurt from their intense activity. He tried to control his strength, veins bulging in his arms, sweat forming on his forehead.

Fluids flowed from her, wetting their joined bodies, the rhythmic sound of their flesh meeting echoing in the small space.

Victoria's body rose and fell, clinging to him, crying out in pleasure.

Tears of ecstasy streamed down her cheeks. William, breathing heavily, leaned in to kiss her, their lips and tongues entwining.

After two more climaxes, William finally released inside her, sighing in satisfaction as he held her close.

The car was filled with a heady atmosphere. Victoria had fallen asleep from exhaustion. William watched her for a while, then gently cleaned her up.

He wanted to dress her, but her dress was soaked with various fluids.

He had no choice but to cover her with his coat.

The car's heater was on, and she slept soundly, not even a frown on her face.

William looked at Victoria, feeling a surge of happiness. He couldn't resist kissing her lips lightly before starting the car and driving away.

The car came to a sudden stop.

Victoria, sleeping in the reclined passenger seat, lost her balance and almost fell forward. A strong hand quickly reached out, steadying her and setting her upright.

Victoria groggily opened her eyes, confusion evident in her gaze. "Where are we?"

"My office," William replied curtly, stepping out of the car first.

Victoria, still disoriented, realized they were at the Scott Group. How did she end up here?

She hurriedly got out, her head still spinning, the alcohol not fully worn off, and her clothes not properly worn.

Victoria thought it might be her imagination.

"Thanks for earlier. I won't bother you at work. I'll just call a cab home," she said.

William's eyes swept over her, a hint of amusement in his gaze. "How are you going to get home? Wearing my coat? Sure, I don't mind. Let's see how you explain it."

Clothes?

Victoria instinctively looked down and realized she was wearing William's coat! He was only in a thin suit jacket, standing tall in the cold wind.

Then she realized something else, hurriedly peeking inside the coat. Her cheeks flushed red-she was only in her underwear!

Victoria quickly pulled the coat tighter, her voice rising. "What happened?"

William's expression was slightly awkward. "You threw up all over yourself."

Victoria's head was foggy, her memory patchy. "Who helped me change?"

William feigned ignorance, quickly walking past her to the company entrance. "Do you want to come in?"

Victoria was in a tough spot, feeling extremely awkward. "I can go buy some clothes nearby."

William took a deep breath, seemingly suppressing something. He strode over, grabbing her arm and pulling her towards the building.

"William! Let go!"

It wasn't quitting time yet, and Victoria knew struggling would draw attention and possibly lead to rumors. She had to endure, trying to keep some distance, but her feet followed him involuntarily.

The more cautious she was, the darker William's expression became.

They entered the elevator, the air thick with awkwardness.

William spoke first. "I'll have someone bring clothes. You can wait in my office."

"No need. I can wait in the conference room."

He raised an eyebrow, a hint of a smile in his eyes. "If you're innocent, why hide our relationship? Unless you're guilty, have you always had feelings for me?"

"You're overthinking it." Victoria turned away. She could stay calm with anyone but him.

After a moment, he asked, "Has Alice given you trouble?"

"No!" Victoria's denial was quick and unconvincing.

Alice was ruthless, willing to do anything to achieve her goals. Victoria had seen it firsthand at the bar, where Alice had framed her for drug dealing. What wouldn't she do?

William said no more. When the elevator doors opened, he walked out.

Victoria followed, still wearing his coat, her head low.

William glanced at her, mocking. "Victoria, are you feeling guilty?"

She snapped back, "Why would I be guilty?"

"Then hold your head up. Even if something happened between us, it's nothing to be ashamed of. No need to carry such a heavy burden. Everyone's busy; no one will watch your every move."

Victoria was taken aback, staring at William's back.

But somehow, she straightened her spine and lifted her head.

He was right. Fear came from guilt. What did she have to be guilty about?

William's office was spacious and stylish, with a minimalist yet tasteful design. Victoria sat obediently on the sofa, waiting.

His new secretary, a man, came in to report. Then managers followed, either getting scolded or receiving instructions.

William's new secretary replaced Lyanna, who had left after Alice publicly humiliated her.

Victoria remembered six months ago, she was one of those getting scolded.

###chapter 208 Not Together Anymore?

William was ruthless at work, his words sharp and cutting.

Victoria hesitated to interrupt, so she pulled out her phone, thinking she'd call a courier to bring her a change of clothes from home.

But just as she opened her phone, William's secretary walked in with a set of clothes.

"Mr. Scott, here are the clothes you requested."

William glanced up and nodded towards Victoria, and the secretary handed the clothes to her.

"That was fast," Victoria said, surprised.

She thought he might have done it on purpose and felt a bit embarrassed by her assumption.

When she looked up, she met William's gaze. He squinted at first, then seemed to understand everything, a slight smile playing on his lips.

Blushing, Victoria quickly took the clothes and headed to the small adjoining room in the office.

The room was still spacious and tidy, reminding her of the time she came here to resign and ended up making love with him.

The more she thought about it, the more she blushed. She hurriedly took off her coat, but in her haste, she caught her hair in the zipper of her dress.

She gasped in pain. Without a mirror, she fumbled to free her hair, only making it worse and pulling out a few strands.

Frustrated, she stomped her foot.

Just then, there was a knock at the door, a light tap before William pushed it open.

"Don't come in!" Victoria cried.

Her dress was half-zipped, her chest barely covered. She turned her back to him, exposing her tangled hair.

Seeing the situation, William raised an eyebrow and walked over. "Why didn't you ask for help?"

"I can do it myself."

"Don't move." William's hand gently brushed her back, his fingers grazing her skin. He knew how delicate her skin was.

He slowly and carefully freed her hair. Victoria stood still, feeling the tenderness in his touch.

Her heart raced, her cheeks flushed. William was special to her, after all.

He was her first love, and they had shared the most intimate moments. She remembered his every little preference.

Since Alvin intervened, she had drawn a clear line between them, and William hadn't pushed.

But some memories were etched deep. A glance, a touch, could bring back those heart-pounding moments.

Feeling the tension in her scalp release, she quickly asked, "Is it free?"

"Yes," William replied in a low voice. "As a thank you"

He leaned in and kissed her back, warm and gentle.

Victoria froze, feeling like she'd been shocked. She turned sharply, pressing her back against the wall. "William, what are you doing?"

William's gaze was intense and heated. Without explaining, he stepped forward, wrapping an arm around her waist.

Her waist was slender, and he felt an urge to tighten his grip, a desire to control that he found intoxicating.

Victoria knew this side of him well. She grabbed his hand, trying to pull it away. "William, we're not together anymore. You can't do this."

"Not together?" William's eyes darkened, a bitter smile on his lips. "Then let's make something happen, and we will be."

He cupped her neck and kissed her hard.

The last two times, she had been drunk, which had its own thrill, but it wasn't her true reaction.

Victoria's mind went blank, overwhelmed by his scent, dominant and invasive.

Her heart pounded, her chest filled with a rush of emotions.

William seemed to have waited for this. One hand pressed against her back, pulling her close.

He knew her body as well as she knew his, aware of every breath, knowing how to make her melt.

Feeling the cool air on her skin, Victoria snapped back to reality. She pushed his hand away, stopping him from going further.

William pulled back, eyes narrowed. "You feel it too."

Victoria didn't deny it, but that made her feel even more ashamed.

"We shouldn't be doing this," she said, trying to stay calm. She pushed against his chest. "We're adults, not kids. This doesn't mean anything."

But what she refused to admit was exactly what he cared about.

William didn't let go, gripping her chin. "So with another man, you'll also feel aroused? Is that what you mean?"

"You too," Victoria shot back, meeting his gaze without flinching. "Don't tell me I'm the only woman you've been with."

William's eyes darkened further.

"Even if you say that, I won't believe it."

Without her, he had Alice. They were practically engaged. No one would believe they hadn't done anything.

William took a deep breath, a bitter smile on his lips. "How much do you think you know me?"

"What about Alice? Did you say the same to her?"

William's brow furrowed slightly.

Coincidentally, his phone rang urgently.

William pressed his lips together, turned, and walked out to take the call.

Victoria took the chance to calm herself, quickly getting dressed and fixing her hair before following him out.

"Alice? Where are you? I'll be right there!"

The call was clearly from Alice. He looked worried, like it was an emergency.

Grabbing his coat and keys, he strode out, pausing briefly to say, "I'll have someone else take you home."

Then he left without looking back.

Victoria stood there, a self-mocking smile on her lips.

'Victoria, what are you expecting? You know this is impossible,' she thought to herself bitterly.

As she stepped out of the Scott Group building, her phone rang. It was the hospital.

"Dr. Myers?"

###chapter 209 What About Me?

Victoria arrived at the hospital in no time, as it wasn't far from her place.

Dr. Tony Myers was already waiting in the hallway. Seeing her rush in, he immediately approached her. "Ms. Carter, your mom's condition is pretty serious."

Victoria listened to Tony's explanation, her brows furrowed tightly the entire time.

"You're her only designated guardian. We need your consent for the next steps in her treatment."

Tony glanced at her before continuing, "Her body's been showing warning signs for a while now. The hospital didn't recommend her discharge in the first place. Right now, we need to prepare for a transplant surgery."

Victoria suddenly asked, "What about Bobby? Did he come with her?"

"He did. But after dropping Nora off at the hospital, he disappeared. The nurses have been trying to reach him, but no luck so far."

"Dr. Myers, I understand. Please go ahead with your plan."

"Alright."

Victoria turned and walked into the hospital room.

It hadn't been long, but Nora had become so emaciated that her features were distorted. Her cheekbones jutted out, making her look like a frail old woman. Her lips were pale and bloodless.

Nora glanced at her and let out a cold laugh, which quickly turned into a violent cough.

Victoria watched her expressionlessly and silently poured her a glass of water.

Nora's voice was hoarse as she asked, "Was it you who posted the video online, making us a laughingstock? Are you proud of yourself?"

Victoria remained silent. She had indeed posted the video. At the time, she was so furious that she just wanted to teach them a lesson.

Nora continued, "You're a worthless piece of trash. I should have killed you the moment you were born, saved myself the trouble. Letting you live is my biggest regret!"

Victoria had heard such words so many times that she was numb to them. She calmly picked up a wet wipe and gently cleaned the spittle from the corner of Nora's mouth.

But Nora wasn't grateful. She even tried to bite Victoria's hand.

Victoria pulled her hand back and looked at her coldly. "Dr. Myers said they'll arrange your surgery soon."

"What surgery?" Nora's eyes widened, her expression not of joy but of suspicion.

"A transplant surgery."

Nora blurted out, "You've come around? You're willing to donate your kidney to me?"

There was a hint of hope in her voice.

Victoria lowered her eyes and let out a soft laugh. "How could it be me? Why would I take away Bobby's chance for medical parole?"

Nora's face changed dramatically. "No! It can't be Bobby! Bobby is absolutely out of the question!"

Victoria slowly closed her eyes. When she opened them again, they were sharp and piercing as she stared at Nora. "He can't, but I can? What's the logic in that?"

Nora struggled to sit up in bed, but she was too weak to support herself. "Bobby has nothing now! If he loses his health, how will he survive?"

"And what about me?" At that moment, all of Victoria's long-suppressed emotions burst forth like a flood.

She pointed at herself, tears welling up in her eyes. "Don't I need a healthy body? Don't I deserve to live well? I'm your daughter. Why have you never seen me? If you only gave birth to me to abandon me, why didn't you just kill me as a baby? Do you think I would be grateful to you today? No! Never! I only hate you!"

"What right do you have to hate me? You shouldn't have been born in the first place. If the doctor hadn't said that an abortion was risky, do you think I would have wanted to have you?" Nora snapped.

Nora's words once again made Victoria see through her so-called "motherly love."

There was no turning back now. What more was there to say?

Victoria nodded slightly, her tone firm and resolute. "Since this mother-daughter relationship disgusts you so much, let's stop torturing each other from now on. I won't take care of your affairs anymore. And I hope you won't interfere in my life either."

"In your dreams!" Nora sneered, her face twisted with rage. She propped herself up with one hand, struggling to sit up. "As long as I have a breath left, you won't get rid of me! I'm your mother. No matter what I've done, you have to take care of me! Otherwise, I'll make your life a living hell!"

She laughed maniacally, but her laughter was cut short by a violent cough. She glared at Victoria with bloodshot eyes. "I'm disgraced because of you, you wretch! What do I have left to lose? Victoria, mark my words, I will never let you go! Even if I die and become a ghost, I'll haunt you forever!"

Victoria lowered her gaze, unwilling to look at that twisted face any longer.

"Maybe you don't know me well enough." She slowly stood up and looked at Nora with cold, calm eyes. "Dad is the only person I care about in this world. For him, I would do anything. As for you, you're nothing to me. I won't be threatened by you."

"Not take care of me? Aren't you afraid of being scorned by everyone, of being fired from the gallery?" Nora screamed. 

In the past, this would have been Victoria's weak spot. Starry Studio Gallery was her last lifeline when she had nowhere else to turn, her spiritual support.

But now, Victoria lowered her eyes and chuckled softly. "Fine, then I'll just become an independent artist. It would be more freeing, and the income wouldn't be bad either."

"What makes you think you can be an artist? After what you did to Bobby, you still want to be an artist?"

"Did you forget who painted those award-winning pieces? If someone like him can make it, why can't I?" Victoria said, curling one side of her lips in disdain. "Don't think of the art world as your backyard. Not only will I enter it, but I'll also become famous! You'll only be able to look at my works in envy and jealousy!"

Nora was utterly disgusted by her pursuit of art. "Do you have that kind of talent? Do you think anyone can become famous?"

"If Bobby can, then the bar must be pretty low." Victoria knew exactly how to hurt her, so she smiled and said, "Everything you've ever wanted, I'll hold in my hands!"

"You're delusional!" Nora was so enraged that her chest heaved violently, her face turning pale, her eyes filled with venom.

Victoria turned and walked towards the door. When she reached it, she paused and looked back, speaking slowly, "You should contact Bobby soon. Since there's a surgery to be done, all pre-op checks are crucial and must be taken seriously."

She smiled slightly and walked out the door.

"Come back! Get back here!" Nora was furious and tried to get out of bed to chase her, but as soon as she swung one leg over the edge, she collapsed to the floor.

Victoria didn't pause for a moment.

Nora lay on the floor, fists clenched, pounding the ground in a fit of rage. "Bobby can't! He can't donate! Do you hear me? Do you hear me?"

The door had already closed. Victoria walked down the hallway, hearing the curses from the room behind her, a bitter smile of self-mockery on her lips.

She had always favored Bobby, from childhood to adulthood, it only got worse!

She could force Victoria to donate her kidney to save her, but she would rather die than use Bobby's kidney!

###chapter 210 Evil Mother

In the hospital lobby, Victoria sat on a bench, staring blankly at the people coming and going through the entrance.

She had been sitting there for quite a while, feeling utterly exhausted.

Nora had always treated her this way, ever since she could remember. Now that she was older, there was no need to feel hurt by such coldness anymore.

At this moment, it was Nora and Bobby who should be in a panic, not her.

After coming to this realization, she slowly stood up and walked to the vending machine to buy a cup of hot coffee.

Just as she took the cup, someone bumped into her from behind, causing the coffee to spill on her chest, making her wince from the heat.

She frowned and looked up to see a middle-aged woman in her forties or fifties, dressed extravagantly, with an arrogant demeanor.

Even though the woman knew she had bumped into someone, she only glanced at Victoria indifferently, without any intention of apologizing.

"Excuse me, ma'am, you..." Victoria froze when she saw the person behind the woman. "Wendy?"

Wendy was hiding behind her mother, Carol Clark. She had recognized Victoria but deliberately avoided her gaze, pulling her scarf up to cover most of her face.

Victoria's heart tightened, and she vaguely guessed the woman's identity. Her expression turned cold as she asked softly, "Wendy, why are you at the hospital? Are you feeling unwell?"

Carol glanced at Victoria arrogantly and asked Wendy with a frown, "Do you know her?"

"Just a colleague, not very close." Wendy was eager to distance herself from Victoria in front of Carol.

Victoria frowned, full of doubts, but she could see Wendy's reluctance and knew she had her reasons, so she didn't press further.

After nodding slightly to the two of them, she threw the paper cup into the trash, bought another cup of coffee, and returned to her seat. She took out a tissue to wipe the coffee stains from her chest.

Carol watched Victoria's departing figure suspiciously and muttered to herself, "Have I seen her somewhere before?"

"She's my colleague. Maybe you've seen a photo or something." Wendy tried her best to conceal Victoria's true identity.

"Is that all?" Carol's brow furrowed. Hearing the nurse call her, she took Wendy into the examination room.

Before entering, she gently patted Wendy's head and forced a smile. "Wendy, you're grown up now. You know what to say and what not to say, right?"

Wendy bit her lip and nodded.

She turned around, dragging her heavy steps, filled with exhaustion and helplessness.

This was just a chance encounter. Victoria understood that Wendy didn't want to share her family matters and didn't intend to pry, thinking that Wendy would speak up when she was ready.

But who could have predicted that the next day, when Victoria received a call from Diana, she would be filled with regret.

When Victoria rushed to the hospital, Diana was already in the room.

Wendy lay on the bed, her hair disheveled, her face bruised and swollen, her body covered in bruises, clearly having been severely beaten.

Victoria walked up, looking at her pale face, her nose stinging with emotion. "What happened? How did you end up like this?"

Diana whispered, "The police called me early this morning. They found her unconscious on the street. They couldn't reach her family, so they called me. The doctor said she has multiple fractures and many old injuries."

Diana sighed softly. "She woke up briefly. I asked if she wanted to call the police, but she refused. She said she was afraid..."

Victoria felt a pang of sorrow. "Afraid of what?"

"Afraid her mom would get into trouble." Diana hesitated. "From the way she talked, it seemed like her mom was the one who beat her because her dad wants a divorce, and she took it out on Wendy."

Victoria's heart was a whirlwind of emotions, and her eyes reddened.

Some mothers were truly mothers, but some were demons to their children.

Victoria silently examined Wendy's injuries, new wounds layered over old ones.

There was a faint scar on her head, already healed. If her hair hadn't been such a mess, it would have been hard to notice. It looked like it had been caused by a hard object.

They couldn't imagine what Wendy had endured over the years.

Victoria was both angry and heartbroken. She decisively said, "I'm calling the police!"

At that moment, a weak hand tugged at Victoria's sleeve, pulling feebly. "Victoria, don't call the police."

Victoria looked down at Wendy, her gaze firm. "If we don't call the police, are we just going to let her keep torturing you? This time you were lucky to be brought to the hospital. What about next time? And the time after that? She may have given you life, but that doesn't give her the right to abuse you!"

Diana also tried to persuade her. "Don't you see? She doesn't see you as her daughter at all."

Just then, the door opened, and Carol walked in.

The moment she saw her, Victoria could feel Wendy's body tense up.

Wendy instinctively lowered her head, gripping Victoria's hand tightly.

In front of others, Carol appeared extremely gentle. Seeing them, she immediately asked with concern, "Are you Wendy's colleagues? Thank you for coming to see her."

Victoria asked directly, "What happened to Wendy's injuries?"

"It breaks my heart to talk about it. I've been sick these past few days, feeling out of it. Wendy insisted on helping with the housework. She's clumsy and accidentally knocked over a hot water bottle, burning herself, and then tripped and fell several times, getting these injuries. I'm heartbroken too."

Carol's eyes reddened as she spoke, her voice choked with emotion, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Wendy turned her head away in embarrassment, burying her face deep in the blanket.

Diana couldn't stand it anymore and said angrily, "Mrs. Clark, Wendy has always been a smart and capable employee at work, never giving me any trouble. How could she be so clumsy at home? Do you really think anyone would believe your story?"

Carol was momentarily stunned, seemingly never having heard anyone speak up for Wendy.

Her facade of gentle kindness shattered, and she screamed hysterically at Wendy on the bed, "If she were so smart, why couldn't she help me win her father's favor? Now her father wants to divorce me and live with his mistress and illegitimate child. Isn't that her fault?"

Wendy cried silently under the blanket, her tears soaking the pillow, but she didn't dare to say a word in protest.

Victoria trembled with anger, glaring at Carol. "So you beat her and abused her to make your husband change his mind?"

'Why are some mothers so cruel, taking out their marital frustrations on their children?' Victoria wondered.

It was clearly her own problem, her own shortcomings. How could she make an innocent child suffer?

"Miss, don't say such things." Carol looked at Victoria, her tone as gentle as a spring breeze. "You're still young and don't understand the difficulties of being a parent. Besides, disciplining my child is our family matter."

With that, she walked to the bed, elegantly lifting a corner of the blanket, her face showing a seemingly concerned smile. "Wendy, tell your colleagues to go home. You need to rest and not waste their time."

Wendy looked at Carol with helpless eyes, instinctively shrinking back into the bed, her voice choked with tears. "You all, you all should go. I'm fine."

Carol's lips curled into a barely noticeable smile, and she politely said, "I'm sorry, my daughter needs to rest now. Please, everyone, leave."

###chapter 211 I Understand

Carol was already trying to shoo Victoria and Diana away, and with Wendy worried about Carol's depression, even if they wanted to stand up for her, it would be pointless if she didn't cooperate.

As they walked out of the hospital room, Diana grew increasingly frustrated, gritting her teeth. "Hasn't she had enough of this misery? We're clearly trying to help her, can't she just be strong for once?"

Victoria was in a foul mood too. Seeing Wendy's condition made her think of herself.

Although Nora hadn't physically abused her when she was young, the long-term mental torment and suffocating oppression had nearly driven her to the brink of collapse. If Alvin hadn't come back, she might not have escaped the fate of being forced to sacrifice by Nora.

In comparison, how much better off was she really?

Just then, Diana spoke up, "Victoria, look over there. Isn't that Samuel?"

Victoria followed her gaze and saw Samuel, indeed. He was talking to a doctor, looking focused and serious.

In the few days since she last saw him, he seemed to have lost weight, with a faint stubble on his chin and a tired look on his face.

After the doctor gave some instructions and left, Samuel turned around and his eyes met Victoria's. He paused for a moment before walking over to her.

"Victoria, what are you doing here?" Samuel's voice was hoarse and low, filled with obvious fatigue.

"Wendy's in the hospital. I came to see her. What about you?"

"It's my dad." His voice carried a hint of bitterness, and he forced a wry smile. "He's pretty sick."

Victoria was taken aback and quickly asked, "What did the doctor say?"

"We've contacted a specialist team from Harborview City. The surgery is scheduled for next month."

Diana, sensing the need for privacy, quietly stepped back to give Victoria and Samuel some space.

Victoria was shocked by the news. No wonder Samuel had been out of touch these past few days-this was what had been going on!

A deep sense of guilt welled up inside her. As his girlfriend, she hadn't been there for him during such a critical time. "Samuel, I..."

"Samuel!"

A clear voice called out from the other end of the hallway. It was Hannah.

She waved at him with a bright smile. "Mr. Brown is looking for you."

Samuel's expression changed instantly. He looked at Victoria first, hurriedly explaining, "I didn't ask her to come."

Seeing Hannah, Victoria understood a bit more. She nodded. "I get it."

She continued, "Mr. and Mrs. Brown both like her. With her here, you can be more at ease."

Samuel should have been pleased with Victoria's understanding, but his feelings were complicated. A subtle, indescribable sense of loss crept into his heart.

He had already taken leave from school, managing the company for Elmer while also taking care of him at the hospital. He was utterly exhausted, with no energy left for sadness.

Victoria spoke softly, "With Ms. Wright here, I won't go visit your father now. Call me when the time is right."

She didn't want Samuel to be caught between her and his parents.

Samuel gazed at her for a moment, then slowly looked away and nodded. "I'll head back now. I'll contact you later."

"Samuel." Victoria called out to him, biting her lip with an apologetic look. "I'm sorry I didn't know until now."

He shook his head with a bitter smile. "How could this be your fault? It just happened recently."

He raised his hand as if to touch her cheek but stopped midway and slowly lowered it. "You have your entrance exams in two weeks. I might not be able to be there with you."

"It's okay. I'm confident. Just take care of Mr. Brown."

She had been spending all her time outside of work studying. With her strong foundation and Samuel's previous tutoring, she was well-prepared for the exams.

She didn't want to burden him with her issues. He had enough on his plate.

Samuel looked at her silently for a long time before sighing. "Alright, I'll go now."

"Okay." Watching him walk away, Victoria felt a pang of heartache.

He seemed to have lost a lot of weight. The once confident and spirited Samuel now looked so worn and defeated.

A bad feeling rose in Victoria's heart. She felt that the distance between her and Samuel was growing.

Her brows furrowed with a hint of worry.

Diana came over and patted her shoulder. "Victoria, don't overthink it. I heard from a friend that Elmer's been unwell for a long time. He delayed going to the hospital, and now it's serious. Samuel must feel really guilty for not taking better care of him."

Victoria nodded. "I understand."

Seeing that Victoria was preoccupied, Diana didn't press the matter further.

***

The next day, at dawn, Victoria hurried to the hospital.

She went straight upstairs to find Tony and ask about Nora's condition.

Despite her deep-seated resentment towards Nora, as a daughter, she couldn't completely abandon her.

Tony informed her that Nora was stalling, neither agreeing to the surgery nor clearly refusing it.

But her health was deteriorating, and she couldn't afford to delay much longer. The hospital had no choice but to ask Victoria to try and persuade her.

"Let her be," Victoria said, surprisingly calm. "She doesn't want Bobby to lose his health because of her. But Bobby's Medical Parole was granted for the transplant surgery. If he doesn't get it, he'll be sent back to prison. That's why she's stuck. If I were the donor, I'd probably be on the operating table by now."

Tony sighed helplessly. For now, they could only wait. "I'll try to contact Bobby and have him talk to her."

Victoria didn't say much more. Asking someone to give up their health for another was a form of moral coercion, even among family.

So, whatever Nora and Bobby decided was their business.

The she went to visit Wendy's room, only to be told by a nurse that Wendy had already been discharged.

Victoria felt a surge of anxiety and quickly took out her phone to call Wendy.

"This line is currently busy. Please try your call again shortly."

Victoria's heart raced. She tried again, but it was still busy.

She called Diana, asking her to find a way to contact Wendy.

After making those arrangements, she headed to Elmer's room.

She knocked gently, and after a moment, the door opened to reveal Hannah.

Hannah's eyes flickered as she looked Victoria up and down. A woman as striking as Victoria was hard to forget, especially since she was the girlfriend of the man Hannah admired.

Victoria hadn't expected her to be there. After a brief pause, she nodded slightly and said softly, "I'm here to see Mr. Brown."

###chapter 212 Let Go

Hannah's lips curved into a friendly smile. "Ms. Carter. Come on in."

The hospital room was a spacious, luxurious suite. As soon as Victoria stepped inside, she saw Primrose sitting by the bed, carefully wiping Elmer's hands.

Elmer looked up, surprised to see her. "Victoria?"

Victoria gently placed the fruit basket and flowers on the nearby table. Primrose, always polite and courteous, warmly invited her to sit and chat.

Hannah quickly poured a glass of water and brought it to her. "Ms. Carter, have some water."

"Thanks."

Elmer's face lit up with affection. "Hannah, you don't need to keep busy. Sit down and rest for a bit. You've been such a help these past few days, Primrose and I are very grateful."

"Mr. Brown, you're too formal. Samuel's busy with work, so it's my duty to take care of you."

Victoria sat quietly, her expression calm and unreadable.

After a while, the doctor came in for a check-up. Seeing this, Victoria quickly stood up to leave. Primrose also stood up. "Victoria, let me walk you out."

Victoria nodded, understanding that Primrose had something to say in private.

In the hallway, Primrose sighed softly, her eyes slightly red. "The doctor said that at his age, the surgery is very risky. We need to be prepared for the worst."

She looked at Victoria with earnest eyes. "Victoria, you know I've always stayed neutral about you and Samuel dating. But now, I have to ask you to let go."

Victoria leaned against the wall, wanting to say something, but her throat felt tight, and she couldn't get a word out.

"You saw it yourself. Hannah is a good girl. Not only in the family, but she can also be a great help to Samuel in his career. Samuel, being an artist, has never run a company. If something happens to his father, he needs someone reliable by his side."

Victoria listened silently, knowing that Primrose was right.

"I can see that Samuel likes you, but he's a filial son. He's caught between you and his father, and it's tearing him apart. So, Victoria, I'm asking you to break up with him to ease his burden."

Primrose didn't press her for an immediate decision. She turned and went back into the room.

Victoria slowly turned around, her head down, lost in thought.

"Are you really going to agree to such a self-sacrificing request?" A familiar voice, full of doubt and sarcasm, broke the silence.

Victoria frowned slightly and turned to see William's cold eyes.

William stood a few steps away, hands in his pockets, looking at her with a mix of mockery and challenge. "You only dare to act tough in front of me. With anyone else, you shrink back."

Victoria was in a mix of shame and anger.

She didn't understand why she always cared so much about her dignity in front of William, not willing to lose even a bit of it.

Before she could ask why William was there, Alice gracefully walked out of the room next door. "William."

William slowly shifted his gaze from Victoria to Alice. "Did the test results come back?"

"The doctor said my immune system's a bit weak, so I need to take it easy for a while." Alice glanced at Victoria, a quick flash of disdain in her eyes before she smiled. "What a coincidence, running into Ms. Carter everywhere."

Though she spoke in a joking tone, her words implied that Victoria was following them on purpose.

Victoria was exhausted, both physically and mentally, from dealing with Nora, Wendy, and the Brown family. She had no time to follow these two around.

But she didn't bother to explain. Alice had never given up on William and saw every woman as a rival.

"I won't keep you. I'll be going now."

"I'll walk you out," William suddenly said.

"No need. It's out of your way."

"How would you know if it's out of my way?"

His words carried a hint of sarcasm, making Victoria's heart tighten.

Victoria pressed her lips together and started to walk away.

But William didn't give her a chance. With a few long strides, he grabbed her arm and pulled her into the elevator.

Alice clutched her test results, her face turning pale with anger. She glared at Victoria before following them into the elevator.

"William, just talk nicely to Ms. Carter."

William's expression grew colder. "Would she listen if I talked nicely?"

Victoria glared at him, trying to shake off his hand. Just as she was about to retort, more people crowded into the elevator, pushing Alice to the other side. Someone even wheeled in a patient, filling the space completely.

Victoria swallowed her words, turning her back to William, trying to make herself as small as possible.

William stood close, their proximity too intimate. Her body pressed against his, making her heart race and her mind flustered. She leaned against the cold elevator wall, desperately trying to create some distance.

Especially when she caught Alice's jealous glare, she felt a chill down her spine.

William's warm breath tickled her ear, making her shiver.

Victoria cursed him silently, feeling her ears burn.

Seeing her trying so hard to distance herself, William's eyes darkened. His chest felt tight with frustration.

He let out a cold laugh and leaned in closer, trapping her in the corner, unable to move.

Victoria's heart pounded.

What was wrong with William? Why did he always take advantage of her?

She was furious but helpless, pushing against his chest.

William didn't budge, standing firm.

He raised an eyebrow, his eyes full of challenge, as if to say, "What can you do about it?"

Victoria struggled, feeling the elevator descend painfully slowly. The chatter around them only highlighted the strange silence in their corner.

The elevator was a confined space, amplifying every sensation. Victoria felt a strange tension in the air, a mix of embarrassment and something more.

William had only meant to tease her, but feeling her soft body tremble against his brought back memories of their close encounter in the car.

Those intimate moments, so close and heated, made him want more.

###chapter 213 Rogue

His breathing grew erratic, the fire in his eyes burning brighter.

He pulled her slender waist towards him, effortlessly wrapping her in his arms.

Victoria gasped, but a large hand lifted her chin, and warm lips pressed against hers.

She felt like she had been struck by lightning, her entire body stiffening, barely daring to breathe.

Her heart pounded wildly.

Her head spun, and she felt as if all the blood in her body had rushed to her cheeks, making her feel unbearably hot.

This was in an elevator!

Any slight movement could draw curious glances from others.

Not to mention, Alice was just a short distance away. Although William's tall frame shielded her completely, she still felt incredibly guilty and nervous, her throat dry, barely able to breathe.

William held her wrist with one hand and cradled the back of her head with the other, deepening the kiss. His lips and tongue forcefully pried open her teeth, exploring and entwining with hers, tasting her sweetness over and over.

His tongue skillfully delved into her mouth, tangling with her own, sucking, licking, and wrapping around it.

It was less a kiss and more an unabashed act of seduction.

And it was happening in plain sight.

Victoria was kissed until she was dizzy, nearly collapsing in his arms.

Finally, he released her, one hand braced against the elevator wall, looking down at her with dark, intense eyes, his voice hoarse. "Victoria, your little mouth only tastes sweet at times like this."

Victoria panted, her heart racing.

She felt like a cat's paw was scratching at her heart, both embarrassed and angry, yet unable to do anything about it.

She glared at him, her face flushed, saying nothing.

William chuckled softly. "What, do you really want to eat me up?"

Victoria was frustrated. William was truly shameless, a complete rogue.

Seeing her puffed-up cheeks, William couldn't help but laugh again, leaning in to kiss the corner of her mouth.

With a buzz, the elevator doors opened.

Victoria exhaled deeply, seizing the opportunity to break free from William's hold, quickly stepping aside, head down, not daring to look at him, and hurriedly stumbled out.

William watched Victoria's hasty retreat, a faint smile playing on his lips, a mix of satisfaction and laziness in his expression.

He leisurely followed, a stark contrast to the domineering intimacy in the elevator.

Alice trailed behind, her head bowed, her face as pale as a sheet.

From the moment they entered the elevator, her eyes had been glued to William and Victoria, not missing a single movement.

When she saw William lean in close to Victoria, his eyes filled with tenderness and unrestrained desire, her heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand, the dull pain spreading through her body.

She had never seen William like this. Normally, he was polite but distant with her, even when she tried her hardest to get close to him, his eyes never showed such intense emotions.

Her throat felt tight and dry, filled with bitterness.

She remembered the nights she tried to get close to him, even when she let go of all her reservations and exposed herself completely to him.

His gaze remained cold, without a ripple, as if she were just a cold statue, unable to stir any desire in him.

It wasn't that he was naturally indifferent, nor that she wasn't good enough, but simply because she wasn't the one who could make his heart race.

Lost in her pain, Alice was suddenly bumped on the shoulder.

She stumbled, her arm hitting the wall hard, tears welling up in her eyes from the pain, her brows furrowing tightly.

Instinctively, she looked up, searching for William, hoping for a bit of concern from him.

But William's eyes were fixed on Victoria, their figures growing more distant.

Alice stood frozen, staring blankly in their direction, her heart filled with a flood of resentment and unwillingness.

Once, he had promised to protect her for life, but now?

She was hurt, and he just ignored it.

She was bumped, and he remained indifferent.

Outside the hospital, William took a few long strides to block Victoria's path.

His tall, imposing figure exuded a natural pressure. He slightly lowered his head, his gaze locking onto hers, questioning, "What do the Brown family take you for? Are you just going to let them pick on you like this?"

Victoria turned her head, avoiding his intense gaze, her voice tinged with fatigue and helplessness. "They didn't really pick on me. Even if they did, it's my own business. I can handle it."

William snorted, a mocking smile on his lips. "Yeah, you're really something."

Victoria didn't want to argue with him here, feeling irritated, she said, "I'm leaving."

As she turned, a strong hand gripped her slender wrist.

Victoria frowned, trying to shake off his hand, nervously looking around, her tone urgent and unfriendly. "Let go!"

William ignored her, his gaze growing colder, a sneer in his voice. "His mother came to you and said those things, proving Samuel is useless. Artists like them don't understand social niceties, they act on whims. If he had any sense, he would have stepped in to resolve the conflict early on, not letting his mother have the chance to show off and boss you around!"

William didn't give her a chance to defend Samuel, commanding. "Break up with him."

Victoria laughed in exasperation, a mocking smile on her lips.

"Who do you think you are? Why should I listen to you?"

"He's not right for you."

"Then who is? You?"

Victoria's retort was casual, without any hint of suggestion.

But seeing William's brows tighten instantly, she realized her words had crossed a line, touching a nerve.

She smiled self-deprecatingly, quickly explaining. "Don't overthink it, I wasn't trying to provoke you, just stating the facts."

"Yes, I'm," he suddenly said.

Victoria looked at him suspiciously, "What?"

William's gaze was deep, as if it could pull her in, silently staring at her.

"William, you're really going to any lengths to ruin my relationship, aren't you?"

Victoria understood his meaning instantly, but she didn't believe it, thinking he was just causing trouble again.

William raised an eyebrow, a cold laugh escaping his lips. "Relationship? Do you think you're happy? Victoria, is it fun deceiving yourself? Pretending to like him, aren't you tired?"

"I'm not."

"You think Samuel can't see it?"

###chapter 214 Try Running Again

Victoria fell silent, feeling like a heavy stone had just hit her heart, sending ripples through her emotions.

She had never really thought about this question, or maybe she had been avoiding it on purpose.

She naively believed that feelings could be cultivated through effort, and their time together seemed to be proving her right.

But Elmer's sudden illness shattered all those beautiful illusions, making all her efforts seem pointless.

It turned out that her 'liking' him was just a temporary sense of comfort, coming from their smooth interactions. But once they hit a snag, this feeling proved to be incredibly fragile.

But this was her own business, and no one else had the right to interfere, not even William!

"William, you weren't even my boyfriend, so what gives you the right to meddle in my life? If you're so bored, why don't you spend more time with your ex-fiancée? Maybe you two can rekindle your old flame!"

William's face turned pale, a vein throbbing on his forehead, clearly infuriated.

In the past, he would have given Victoria a harsh lesson for such defiance.

But he suppressed his anger, staring at her with a dark gaze. "Didn't you hear what I just said?"

"What? That I should break up, or that you're mocking my unhappiness?"

She deliberately twisted his words, and a flash of coldness crossed William's eyes. He lowered his gaze and let out a cold snort. "Victoria, listen to me. There won't be a next time."

Victoria turned her head away, unwilling to look at him, and the atmosphere between them instantly dropped to freezing.

The sound of high heels clicking on the floor echoed behind them, cutting William off before he could speak out his feelings.

Alice limped closer, her voice tinged with a hint of grievance. "William."

In just a couple of seconds, William composed himself, returning to his usual calm demeanor. He turned to look at her, his gaze falling on her injured foot. "What happened?"

"I twisted it getting out of the elevator." Alice reached out her hand, and William naturally took it, carefully helping her to the car.

Victoria stood behind, watching coldly, a mocking smile playing on her lips.

See, he was always different with Alice.

If that was the case, why did he keep bothering her?

William returned, his gaze sweeping over Victoria as he curtly said, "Get in the car."

"No need." Victoria's refusal was crisp and decisive, without a hint of hesitation.

"Victoria, don't make me angry, or you'll face the consequences."

William reached out, grabbed her arm, and unceremoniously shoved her into the passenger seat.

Victoria frowned in displeasure, but she wasn't a child anymore and saw no point in struggling. If he wanted to drive her, so be it.

Alice sat in the back, her eyes glaring at Victoria through her glasses. William said nothing after getting in the car.

Victoria turned to look out the window. The street scenes flashed by like a slideshow, but her gaze was empty, as she was lost in thought.

Alice's face grew darker, her expression so gloomy.

Before long, the car came to a slow stop.

William unbuckled his seatbelt and turned to Victoria, his tone still indifferent. "Wait here."

Victoria snapped back to reality, thinking they had arrived at her place. She was about to unbuckle her seatbelt when she saw William already walking around to the other side, opening the back door and extending his hand to Alice. "Give me your hand."

Victoria froze, quickly realizing this wasn't her neighborhood.

Out of the corner of her eye, Victoria saw Alice slowly place her hand in William's, letting him help her out of the car.

She vaguely heard him say to Alice as they walked away: "I'll call a doctor for you."

In that moment, she realized that when he said "wait here," he meant her!

William escorted Alice to her door, where a servant came out to greet them. He gently handed Alice over, briefly instructing, "She twisted her ankle."

Just as he was about to leave, Alice grabbed his arm, her voice pleading. "William, can you stay with me for a while?"

William's gaze fell on her, calm and deep, like an unfathomable, undisturbed pool, never rippling for her.

"Get some rest." He gently pried her hand away, his movements devoid of any affection.

But Alice stubbornly refused to let go, her eyes red and tearful, staring at him. "I'm hurt, can't you see? Just stay with me for a little while, please?"

"She is waiting for me." His tone remained firm as he once again gently pushed her hand away, turning to the servant. "Take good care of her."

With that, he walked away without looking back.

"William! William!" Alice's desperate cries echoed behind him, but William's steps never faltered. He quickly disappeared into the night.

When he returned to the car, the passenger seat was empty.

William's brows furrowed in frustration. He should have known that stubborn Victoria wouldn't obediently wait. He should have locked the car door before leaving.

Fortunately, Victoria hadn't gone far.

As the car slowly exited the neighborhood, he spotted her immediately.

A young man was trying to chat her up, his eyes roaming over her in a way that made William's stomach turn.

William parked the car, got out, and strode over, placing a firm hand on the man's shoulder. "A word."

"Who are you? I don't know you, and I have nothing to say to you."

Victoria saw this and quickly intervened. "William!"

"This doesn't concern you. Stay put." William shot her a cold glance. "Try running off again and see what happens."

He forcibly dragged the man towards the bushes, and Victoria bit her lip, her brows knitted in worry.

Though she knew William was usually measured, she couldn't help but feel anxious.

Not long after, William emerged, hands in his pockets, calmly buttoning his sleeves as if he had just dealt with a trivial matter.

Victoria looked past him, puzzled. "Where's that guy?"

"Gone."

"I've been here the whole time. I didn't see him leave."

"He went out the side gate."

Ignoring her doubting gaze, William stepped forward, grabbed her wrist, and pulled her back to the car.

She thought he would finally take her home, but to her surprise, the car headed towards her old apartment complex.

"Why are we going here?" She leaned forward, curious. "Do you still live here?"

William turned off the engine and got out, glancing back at her. "Come on."

Victoria hesitated for a moment before slowly opening the door and getting out, muttering, "You still haven't answered my question."

"Yes. For some peace and quiet."

William strode towards the building, and Victoria stood there, full of questions.

He walked a few steps, then stopped and looked back at her with a faint smile. "Are you coming on your own, or do I have to carry you? Either way, the result is the same."

After weighing her options, Victoria reluctantly followed.

William's lips curled into a slight smile, a hint of amusement in his eyes.

###chapter 215 I Just Can't

William didn't say a word as he swiftly took off his jacket and tossed it onto the couch.

"You coming in or what?"

He walked out of the kitchen, casually holding a glass of water.

Victoria shook her head firmly. "We should keep our distance."

No matter how she felt about Samuel, as long as she was publicly known as his girlfriend, she couldn't get too close to William. Coming here was already pushing it; she couldn't afford another mistake.

A hint of amusement curved William's lips as he slowly approached her. "I told you, I bought this entire floor. Even if something happens between us, no one will know."

Victoria's face turned pale with a mix of shock and anger. "If that's why you called me up here, then I was wrong about you!"

She turned to leave.

"So far, I haven't done anything to Alvin. Do you know why?"

As expected, Victoria stopped in her tracks and turned back, glaring at him. "William! If you dare harm my dad, I'll never forgive you!"

William crossed his arms, standing tall and unyielding, his face as cold and emotionless as a frozen mountain.

"What makes you think I would stop hating him for you?"

Victoria was momentarily speechless.

Exactly, what made her think that?

William took a step closer, his deep eyes locking onto hers as if trying to see through her. "I've never found an answer to that question."

She looked up at him.

He took another step closer, closing the distance between them until he could touch her cheek with a slight movement.

William's brows furrowed, his voice low and filled with visible struggle, which eventually turned into a helpless sigh. "But you were right to bet on it."

Victoria's heart skipped a beat, and she was momentarily flustered, staring at him in a daze.

William's deep-set eyes, usually cold and sharp, now seemed to hold a focus that made her feel like she was the only one in his world, making it hard to pull away.

"I don't want to deceive myself." William's voice was calm but carried an undeniable authority. "I don't want to see any other man by your side. Only me."

If, at the hospital entrance, Victoria could still think he was just messing with her, now she couldn't.

William might act erratically at times, but deep down, he was proud. He would never use emotions to bind a woman.

Seeing her silence, William frowned slightly. "Do you understand what I mean?"

Honestly, even if he asked himself, he might not be able to clearly explain his feelings.

Victoria pressed her lips together and, under his almost stubborn gaze, finally spoke softly. "I understand."

But William wasn't satisfied. He stepped closer, their bodies almost touching, and she could feel his warm, rapid breath.

"So?"

Victoria turned her head, avoiding his intense gaze. "So, maybe maintaining the status quo is the best choice. Or we could just cut ties."

For a long time, William didn't respond. Victoria resisted the urge to look back, trying to keep her voice steady. "If there were no grudges between our families; if we hadn't been in such a degrading relationship, I think I would have fallen in love with you. But reality is what it is. I can't pretend the past never happened, or I would feel disgusted with myself."

William stood by the door, his figure hidden in the shadows, his eyes half-closed, making it hard to read his emotions.

When she said "disgusted," his eyelashes trembled slightly, and the turmoil in his chest seemed to freeze instantly.

Victoria finished speaking, her head lowered, her body trembling as she tried to suppress her emotions. "I can't be with you after all your forceful advances. I just can't."

William's Adam's apple bobbed as he struggled to speak, but in the end, he remained silent.

"I'll break up with Samuel," she said softly. "But not for you. You're right. I tried, but I never truly loved him. So it's better to end it early and be honest with him. I don't want him to be torn between me and his family."

"Lastly," she looked at him with a complex expression, "thank you for not hurting my dad. I know, with your power, you could have dealt with him easily, but you didn't. Even though you sent him to prison, you also helped get him out on parole and saved his life in Xandria. So, thank you."

Her words sounded like a final farewell.

William pressed his tongue against his teeth and let out a self-deprecating laugh. "You said so much, but never got to the point. You could have just said one thing to make me back off."

Victoria looked at him, puzzled.

"You don't like me." He stepped closer, his chest almost touching her back. "Just say you don't like me, and I won't bother you anymore."

Victoria's face turned red with visible panic. "I..."

"Too late. It's too late to say anything now."

A barely noticeable smile appeared on William's lips as he watched her struggle to explain.

He mercilessly pinched her cheek, stopping any words he didn't want to hear.

"Victoria, I gave you a chance."

Victoria's eyes widened in disbelief. She had said so much sincerely, yet he still didn't understand.

William suddenly grabbed her waist, pulling her close, their foreheads touching, his breath hot on her face. His voice was low and seductive. "If it's not dislike, then it's like."

"No-"

Before she could finish, William leaned in to kiss her fiercely.

Victoria's eyes widened, her mind exploding like thunder, and the world seemed to lose all sound.

She struggled desperately, and in her panic, she bit him hard!

William winced, frowning as he let go of her. He wiped his lip and saw the blood on his hand. He suddenly laughed. "Is it that hard to admit you like me?"

She was both angry and flustered, her face red. "I don't like you at all!"

He shrugged nonchalantly, a hint of defiance in his eyes. "I don't care."

William pinched her cheek again, his mood seemingly lifted, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.

"From now on, you stay by my side. You're not going anywhere."

Victoria bit her lip, trying to stay calm. She took a deep breath and looked him in the eye. "So, am I your girlfriend?"

###chapter 216 Scaring Her Off

William was caught off guard. The title that usually seemed so ordinary now felt oddly foreign coming from her.

His brief hesitation was like a needle, lightly pricking Victoria's heart, stirring up a wave of bitterness.

But she quickly pushed those feelings down, becoming even more composed and determined. "If you're not sure, don't mess with me."

"It's not that I'm unsure." William, surprisingly serious, paused before speaking slowly. "I'm just not used to it. When I think of you, all I remember are the intimate moments we spent together."

"Cut it out!"

Victoria's face flushed with embarrassment, and she quickly interrupted him, her voice carrying a hint of playfulness.

He smirked knowingly and let out a low chuckle. "It's just a title. It doesn't change anything for me."

He paused, locking eyes with her, and said deliberately, "Let's just call it girlfriend."

Victoria thought William had completely lost his mind.

Even though he had just asked her to be his girlfriend, she felt no joy at all.

Without thinking, she pushed him away forcefully and stumbled towards the door, her voice trembling. "Stop talking nonsense. There's no way we could ever be together."

William's deep eyes narrowed dangerously, his voice cold and hard. "Why not?"

Victoria's mind was in turmoil, and she shook her head desperately, her face full of resistance. "Don't ask me why. It just can't happen!"

With that, she practically fled, rushing out the door.

William stood in the hallway, his brow furrowed, his expression complex and inscrutable.

"Well, that was unexpected!"

A lazy voice reached his ears. William turned to see Eugene, raising an eyebrow slightly. "What brings you here?"

Eugene, reeking of alcohol, leaned casually against the doorframe, a mischievous smile on his lips. "I can't believe it, William. You confessed to Victoria and scared her off?"

William ignored him, his face expressionless as he walked into his room. Eugene, uninvited, swaggered in after him.

Watching William pour himself a drink and down it in one gulp, Eugene couldn't help but tease, "Drowning your sorrows in alcohol? That's not like you."

William leaned on the table, his usual cold and indifferent demeanor intact, but the faint mist in his eyes betrayed his inner turmoil.

Eugene found it amusing and raised an eyebrow. "Did you really think she'd just agree because you asked her to be your girlfriend?"

William finally glanced at him, but it was a brief, impatient look.

"William! With all the things you've done to Victoria, is it any wonder she wants nothing to do with you? The way you treated her, the pressure you put on her-it's no surprise she rejected you."

William swirled the drink in his glass, his tone certain. "She has feelings for me."

"So what?" Eugene scoffed. "Having feelings for you is one thing, but resenting and hating you is another. Trust me, women can tell the difference."

William grew increasingly irritated, glaring at him. "Who invited you here?"

"You bought so many houses. I thought I'd help you make use of them."

"This place isn't exactly your style, Mr. Eugene Bailey."

"If you can lower your standards, why can't I?"

William didn't believe his excuse and spoke slowly, "I heard your fiancée showed up?"

Eugene groaned, "I don't even know when I got a fiancée! Apparently, it's an engagement my grandfather arranged before he struck it rich. The girl's family hit hard times, and now she's come looking for help. Can you believe it? She's like a bad luck charm, bringing misfortune to her whole family. Even if I didn't have feelings for Grace, I couldn't marry her."

"What does your family think? Do they want you to marry her?"

Eugene sighed again. "My mom's against it, but you know my dad. He's old-school and stubborn. Since it's a promise my grandfather made, he'd sacrifice me to keep it."

He laughed bitterly. "Can you believe arranged marriages still exist in this day and age?"

William nodded slightly, a faint smile on his lips. "Yeah, Mr. Bailey is quite the man of principle."

Eugene stared at him in disbelief. "Whose side are you on? I get it now-you can't be happy, so you don't want anyone else to be either!"

William raised his glass to him. "Exactly."

***

Victoria had been distracted these past few days. Hearing William ask her to be his girlfriend had stirred up her emotions.

But she kept reminding herself that it was impossible between them. She couldn't accept or love someone who had humiliated her so many times.

It felt like betraying her past self, who had suffered so much.

After dinner, Alvin called Victoria over.

"Where's Samuel been lately?"

"His father is sick. He's been busy at the hospital."

Alvin looked at Victoria calmly, with a hint of inquiry in his eyes. "As his girlfriend, you should be helping him through this."

Victoria opened her mouth but didn't know how to explain. She could only say, "I've been really busy with work and exams. I can't find the time."

Alvin gave her a long look before lowering his eyes and asking softly, "Do his parents not like you?"

Victoria couldn't tell Alvin the truth and quickly explained, "No, they like me a lot! I'm just really busy..."

"Victoria." Alvin interrupted, his voice steady. "If there's a problem, I can talk to his parents. I'll take the blame. Don't let them pick on you."

"That's not necessary!" Victoria firmly refused. She couldn't bear to let Alvin face such treatment.

They fell into silence.

After a while, Victoria spoke softly, "Dad, if the relationship requires you to humble yourself, it's not worth having."

Alvin lowered his head, full of guilt. "I'm holding you back."

Victoria smiled, trying to comfort him. "Dad, don't think that way! I've never felt you held me back. I'm grateful you've always been there for me, so I wouldn't be alone."

Her voice trailed off.

Alvin felt a pang of sadness. After a moment, he spoke seriously, "Even if it's not Samuel, it can't be William."

Victoria was taken aback and looked at Alvin. His expression was serious. "He's not right for you."

Victoria quickly composed herself, looking away. "I understand."

"And your mother..."

At the mention of Nora, Victoria frowned. "Has she been bothering you again?"

"It's about her surgery." Alvin paused before continuing. "She called, asking me to help find a kidney donor."

"She can't bear to use Bobby's kidney, but she almost tricked me into donating mine back then." Victoria's tone was calm, as if recounting someone else's story.

"So, I refused her." Alvin's response surprised Victoria.

His expression was indifferent. "I don't care how she treats me, but she shouldn't have treated you that way."

Victoria was at a loss for words.

Just then, there was a knock at the door.

Victoria opened it to find Samuel sitting on the steps, smoking. From behind, he looked exhausted, a far cry from his usual confident self.

###chapter 217 Breakup

Hearing footsteps, he turned his head slightly and gave Victoria his signature warm smile, though it couldn't hide the deep exhaustion in his eyes.

Victoria walked over slowly and sat down next to him. "Just came from the hospital?"

"Yeah."

He stubbed out his cigarette and looked at her, his eyes glimmering with tiny sparks. "My dad collapsed this afternoon. My mom was crying so hard she couldn't even stand."

He spoke lightly, with a faint, almost imperceptible smile on his lips.

Samuel never thought he would face a choice between family and love.

He had always been the prodigy artist, sailing through life without much trouble.

It wasn't until Elmer fell seriously ill that he realized it wasn't his own brilliance but Elmer's support that allowed him to pursue his passions without worry.

Now, with Elmer down, it was his turn to support his parents, and he finally understood how hard it had been for them all these years.

Victoria's heart tightened painfully.

She gazed at him, then suddenly raised her hand and gently hugged him.

Samuel closed his eyes tightly, wrapping his arms around her with force, his voice choked with emotion. "Victoria, I'm sorry."

When Victoria returned home, Alvin was sitting on the couch, smoking.

"Where's Samuel?"

"He's gone."

Alvin just sat there quietly, looking at her with a pained expression.

Victoria walked over slowly, gently took Alvin's arm, and rested her head on his shoulder. After a long silence, she murmured softly, "Why does it still hurt so much?"

Alvin's eyes narrowed sharply, but he just extended his arm and pulled Victoria into a tight embrace.

Victoria nestled in Alvin's arms, closing her eyes as tears rolled down her cheeks and soaked into her clothes.

Alvin's embrace was warm and broad.

But her heart ached.

She understood Samuel deeply, and she wasn't surprised they had reached this point.

Even without Elmer's sudden illness, there might have been other reasons forcing them to face separation.

Seeing Victoria like this, Alvin's eyes flashed with determination. "Do you want me to go talk to him?"

Like any father who loves his daughter, Alvin was certain that Victoria had been wronged and that the fault lay with someone else!

Victoria looked up, a hint of helplessness in her eyes, and a slightly bitter smile on her lips. "Dad, it's not his fault. He's always tried so hard to be close to me. If anything, I owe him."

Her smile gradually faded, replaced by a look of loneliness.

Maybe people were like this: they only realized the value of something after it had gone, and then started to miss it deeply.

At this moment, memories of Samuel's kindness flooded her mind-their every interaction, his devoted care, selfless affection, unwavering support, and constant encouragement.

Shielding her from all harm and gossip.

She hadn't realized that she had developed a special feeling for him, a feeling different from love.

Maybe even she couldn't be sure if it was romantic love, but it had quietly taken root in her heart.

The more she thought about it, the stronger her guilt grew. Even though Samuel had been the one to suggest the breakup, she still felt she owed him too much.

The news of Samuel and Hannah's engagement came on three days later, with the ceremony set for the weekend.

It came suddenly, yet it made sense.

Even Wendy, who had been absent for a while, couldn't help but call Victoria.

"My uncle got an invitation from the Wright family. That's how I found out Samuel and Hannah are getting engaged."

"Yeah, I know." Victoria's tone was particularly calm. "If you're free that day, you should go and have some fun. Don't stay cooped up at home all the time."

"Victoria, are you okay?"

"What could be wrong? We talked it out and broke up amicably. Besides, we didn't have much going on anyway."

Victoria was in the library, studying for exams that were just a week away. She had been focusing most of her energy on her studies.

"I heard about Samuel's family situation too. He must be really upset. But he has no choice because of his father." Wendy instinctively defended Samuel. 

She had always supported Victoria and Samuel being together, but fate had other plans.

"Victoria, can I ask you something?"

"Sure, what?"

"If Samuel came back to you, would you take him back?"

Wendy wasn't just asking casually. She believed that Samuel was so devoted to Victoria that he wouldn't give up easily.

Victoria lowered her gaze slightly, looking out at the bustling street outside the window. She spoke softly, "He won't, and neither will I."

Wendy could only sigh and say no more.

When Hannah walked in, she saw Victoria calmly gazing out the window, looking as beautiful as a delicate painting.

She stood at the door for a moment before walking over and sitting down in front of Victoria.

Victoria looked up, surprised to see Hannah. After a pause, she said calmly, "Ms. Wright, what can I do for you?"

Hannah got straight to the point. "Ms. Carter, I hope you can make time this weekend to attend my and Samuel's engagement party."

With that, she elegantly took an invitation from her bag and gently slid it across the table.

Victoria looked at Hannah, feeling a bit strange. "Ms. Wright, why are you inviting me?"

Hannah smiled slightly, her tone generous. "I know you and Samuel were once a couple, and I understand why he agreed to marry me. But that's all in the past. What's important is the future, and that's us being together. So, I hope you can attend our engagement party, to witness it and to formally say goodbye to him."

Victoria understood her meaning and nodded. "Ms. Wright, don't worry. Since we've broken up, I won't interfere."

"Then you should come and give your blessings in person!" Hannah said.

If it weren't for Hannah's sincere expression, her words would have sounded like a deliberate provocation.

Victoria found the request a bit unreasonable. She had agreed to part ways amicably, so why insist she attend?

Seeing Victoria's displeasure, Hannah was silent for a moment before speaking slowly. "Ms. Carter, can you understand how I feel? I just want to fully have him, without him lingering in the past. I know he liked you a lot, so can you help me make sure he lets go completely?"

###chapter 218 Engagement Invitation

Victoria froze, lowering her head to look at the invitation Hannah had handed her, her fingers lightly touching the soft red cover.

As a woman herself, Victoria understood that Hannah was doing this out of insecurity, seeking some comfort from her.

And Hannah was right; she and Samuel did need a proper goodbye.

Victoria forced a smile at Hannah. "I'll be there on time."

"Thanks," Hannah said with a sweet smile before getting up and leaving.

Watching Hannah's retreating figure, a faint trace of sarcasm crossed Victoria's lips.

She was becoming more and more hypocritical.

***

On the weekend, Victoria got up early.

She took a long, relaxing bath, then opened her wardrobe to carefully select the perfect outfit. Sitting at her vanity, she meticulously did her makeup.

Since it was a final farewell, she had to look her best to give Samuel peace of mind.

Before leaving, on a whim, Victoria took out the ring box from her drawer, stared at it for a long moment, and finally put it on.

Victoria stepped out of the car at the hotel entrance, gently lifting her dress as she prepared to walk inside. Suddenly, a group of reporters rushed out from both sides. "Ms. Carter!"

Caught off guard by the sudden appearance of so many reporters, Victoria froze, her steps halting.

"Ms. Carter, we've heard you were very close with Mr. Brown. Is that true?"

"So, Ms. Carter, in what capacity are you attending today? As a friend of Mr. Brown or as his ex-girlfriend?"

"Rumor has it that the Brown family disapproved of you, which led to your breakup."

Victoria found herself surrounded, unable to move.

Seeing the microphones almost touching her face, she quickly raised her arms to shield herself.

Where did these reporters get their information?

Their relentless questioning drew the attention of many guests.

Hearing the reporters' questions and looking at Victoria, the guests' eyes filled with disdain.

So, she was Samuel's ex-girlfriend. Who knew what kind of entanglement they had?

Her presence here was clearly to cause trouble for the engaged couple. What was she up to?

Victoria felt utterly humiliated by their gazes.

The reporters continued to hound her, and Victoria kept retreating, her face growing increasingly pale. "These are all baseless rumors. I have nothing to say."

A sharp reporter immediately followed up, "Are you refusing to respond because you feel guilty?"

At that moment, a slightly cold voice cut in, "Why are you harassing my girlfriend?"

Victoria turned towards the voice and saw William standing at the back of the crowd, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.

William strode towards Victoria with long, confident steps.

He wore a perfectly pressed black suit, his hair neatly styled, his handsome features exuding a noble and proud aura.

He wrapped his arms around Victoria's slender waist, a hint of anger flashing in his eyes before quickly disappearing.

He curved his lips into a charming smile and asked softly, "Baby, did they give you a hard time? If they made you uncomfortable, I can sue their companies into bankruptcy."

Though he whispered in her ear, his voice was loud enough for all the reporters to hear clearly.

The reporters exchanged shocked glances. Since when was Victoria William's girlfriend?

But then again, rumors about them had been circulating for a while.

There had been talk that Victoria was William's sugar baby, and later, gossip suggested she had come between William and Alice, leading to their breakup before the wedding.

Now, with William publicly declaring their relationship, it seemed to make sense.

The reporters were instantly excited. This was a big scoop!

They swarmed around the couple, "Mr. Scott, when did you and Ms. Carter start dating?"

"Ms. Carter, can you tell us why you and Mr. Scott started dating?"

The barrage of questions made Victoria's head spin, like a swarm of flies buzzing around her. She opened her mouth to speak, "We..."

"We're doing great." Before Victoria could finish, William cut her off, smiling as he gently but firmly led her into the hotel. "The ceremony is about to start. It's rude to be late."

Ignoring the persistent reporters behind them, William kept a relaxed smile on his face, his hand sliding down her shoulder to rest on her waist. "You don't want to upset the Brown family, do you? Admitting our relationship is the best way to handle this."

Victoria frowned. Though his words made sense, something felt off.

She turned her head to glare at William, her eyes filled with anger. "You planned this, didn't you?"

William didn't deny it. Instead, he looked at her with an appreciative, almost amused expression. "You're not as dumb as you look. But I did come to attend the engagement ceremony. I just didn't expect you to be here."

Victoria turned away, struggling to break free from his hold. "Do you realize the trouble your words just caused? Not only will our privacy be exposed, but my father will also be dragged into this!"

Hearing her concern for Alvin, William's eyes grew colder, his tone mocking. "If he doesn't want to be involved, he shouldn't be in this circle. It's really responsible of him to let his daughter worry about his mess."

His sarcasm infuriated Victoria. "I know you still hate him, but I'm his daughter. It's my duty to protect him. If you can't stand it, stay away from me! I never begged you to stay!"

William looked at her in disbelief, anger flashing in his eyes. "Who taught you to use and discard people like this?"

Victoria ignored him, taking the opportunity to break free and stride towards the venue.

William stood there, watching her stubborn back, his eyes darkening.

"Having a fight?" Eugene approached with a smirk, glancing at William. "Didn't expect you to be so cunning!"

William shot him a look, uninterested. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Announcing she's your girlfriend in public was a brilliant move! She can't back out now. After all, it's better to be seen as your girlfriend than to be accused of interfering in someone else's relationship."

William casually slipped his hands into his pockets, walking leisurely into the banquet hall. "Whether she admits it or not, the result is the same."

"Just a word of advice, don't get too cocky."

###chapter 219 Formal Farewell

William waved his hand dismissively, looking completely unconcerned.

The banquet hall was extravagantly elegant, like a dreamland. The entire hall was filled with large arrangements of fresh flowers, and a pristine white lace carpet stretched out at the end of the red carpet. In the center stood two massive cake displays.

The air was thick with the enticing scent of roses, and the room was filled with well-dressed business moguls and political elites.

Samuel, dressed in a white suit that accentuated his tall, lean frame, had a handsome face that was marred by exhaustion and irritation. He stood quietly in a corner, as if the day's festivities had nothing to do with him.

It wasn't until he saw Victoria walk in that the icy facade on his face showed the slightest crack. He stared at her intently, as if she were just out of reach despite being so close.

"I invited her," Hannah said softly, approaching him with a gentle smile. "I thought you should have a proper goodbye."

Samuel's expression darkened, his eyes cold and tinged with anger as he looked at her. "What gives you the right to make decisions for me? I told you, we don't interfere in each other's business."

"But I don't agree with that," Hannah replied, still smiling but with a steely determination in her eyes. "Samuel, you're my fiancé. You need to be completely honest with me. If you still have lingering feelings for your ex, I can't accept that."

"It won't happen," Samuel said, his voice tinged with sadness. He then let out a self-deprecating laugh. "Even if I wanted to, she wouldn't."

Hannah's gaze was intense. "I know you still like her, a lot. That's fine, I can give you time. But I won't tolerate any form of betrayal, even if it's only emotional."

Samuel's lips curled into a slight smile, his eyes narrowing as he spoke through gritted teeth. "I can call off the ceremony anytime before it starts."

Hannah smiled sweetly again. "Of course, you have that right. But I hope you'll consider your father."

She glanced over at Elmer, who looked a bit pale but was smiling happily. "Look how happy he is."

Samuel's brow furrowed, and he bit his lip hard before slowly turning to look at Elmer Has it been a long time since you've seen him this happy?"

Hannah's voice seemed to have a bewitching power, reaching deep into his heart.

Samuel looked away from Elmer and back at Hannah, his gaze turning icy. "Hannah, stop using the same tactics you use on my parents."

Hannah's expression faltered, a flash of panic in her eyes, but she quickly regained her composure. "What do you mean?"

He paused for a moment before speaking slowly. "I appreciate everything you've done for me, taking care of my parents, keeping them company, making them happy. For that, I'm truly grateful. But..."

His tone suddenly shifted, his eyes filled with warning and distance. "Since I've agreed to our engagement, I won't go back on my word. But don't think you can control me, and don't try to use the people around me to threaten me. I won't accept it."

With that, he turned and walked away, his steps firm and unwavering.

Hannah bit her lip, then suddenly shouted at his retreating back, "You're scared I'll go to her, aren't you? Don't worry, she doesn't care about you at all! You're nothing to her! Don't you get it? You fool!"

***

Watching the couple on stage, Victoria found herself surprisingly calm, though the occasional glances from the Brown family made her uncomfortable.

She recognized most of the Brown family members. When she had attended Samuel's grandfather's birthday party as his girlfriend, it had caused quite a stir, and Samuel had to apologize to his elders.

Those same middle-aged women were now casting cold looks at Victoria while laughing and chatting loudly.

"I told you, they would break up eventually!"

"Victoria can't compare to Ms. Wright. She's not good enough for Samuel!"

"Exactly! Ms. Wright is from a noble family, she's beautiful, and most importantly, she's very filial! She even got me some special ointment from abroad for my knee pain. It really works."

Victoria didn't mind. She had heard worse over the years. 

But William's face was extremely gloomy. He slightly turned his head to glance at Eugene.

"I'm not going," Eugene pretested.

"Should I call your fiancée and tell her where you are?"

Eugene sighed deeply, looking resigned. "Remember, I'm doing this to uphold justice, not because you're forcing me!"

With that, he got up and walked over. "Ladies..."

William raised an eyebrow, a faint smile playing on his lips.

It was making the best use of resources.

In no time, Eugene had the previously cold and sarcastic women laughing heartily.

Just then, Victoria's name was called from the stage.

She looked up to see Hannah holding a microphone. "Ms. Carter is a mutual friend of Samuel and me. Samuel often praises her talent in painting. Today is our special day, and I wonder if Ms. Carter could paint an engagement portrait for us?"

The spotlight focused on Victoria, and her image appeared on the large screen.

William glanced at her, displeased.

He hated seeing anyone force her, no matter the reason.

Samuel's face darkened, and he strode forward to grab the microphone, but Hannah deftly sidestepped, whispering so only he could hear, "I'm helping her gain recognition. Look at the lively atmosphere, and your dad is so happy. What's wrong with asking her to paint? It could even promote her work."

Samuel's eyes were cold, and Hannah felt a chill run through her. "Hannah, you've gone too far."

She hesitated, then looked away.

In her mind, defending her relationship in this way was justified.

After all, Victoria's award-winning paintings were well-known, and her entanglements with Nora and Bobby were widely discussed. The room buzzed with excitement, and applause erupted.

Victoria lowered her eyes, silent for a moment.

Her phone buzzed with a message from William: [If you don't want to paint, don't. No one can force you.]

Victoria's lips curved into a slight smile.

If it were anyone else, she would have refused without a second thought.

But Samuel was different. She didn't want to ruin his engagement ceremony.

Besides, he had painted so many portraits of her, from the large oil painting when they first met in his studio to the pencil sketch on the snowy mountain and the drawing in the hospital.

###chapter 220 Hope You Are Happy

Every line, every color in the paintings he made for her spoke of his love and indulgence. Whenever she saw them, her heart stirred.

He had put in so much effort, but she had let him down.

"Alright," Victoria agreed, "I'll give it a shot."

Victoria's fingertips turned white from gripping the edge of the canvas too tightly. She took a deep breath, trying to steady her emotions before looking back at the stage where the handsome couple stood.

Today, she was going to return all his deep feelings to him. 

Hannah's lips curled into a slight smirk, a hint of mockery in her eyes.

Victoria lowered her head and began to draw, her pencil moving across the pristine paper.

The image gradually took shape, each stroke outlining Samuel's handsome features, his gentle, smiling eyes, and his hand entwined with Hannah's, both wearing their engagement rings.

***

Outside the hotel, a swarm of reporters had gathered.

William had publicly announced that Victoria was his girlfriend, and the news had spread like wildfire across social media platforms. The headlines were everywhere.

Major news outlets had picked up the story, leaving no room for clarification or retraction.

Victoria had anticipated some reporters, but she hadn't expected this many!

But she had no time to worry about them now. She was anxiously making a phone call.

"Dad, we're not dating. He was just helping me out. Really, we're not! I swear!"

On the other end, Alvin's tone was firm and resolute. He was fine with Victoria dating anyone she wanted, except William! 

No matter what, he would never allow Victoria to get involved with William! Even if it cost him his life, even if he ended up in prison again, he would never let Victoria and William have any entanglements!

Victoria's heart tightened, and she walked out with her head down, her voice weak, "Dad, don't worry. I remember what I promised you."

She hung up, feeling utterly dejected.

As soon as Victoria stepped out of the hotel, the reporters swarmed her like sharks smelling blood.

She had already prepared a statement to clarify her relationship with William, but a sleek, imposing black Range Rover suddenly pulled up in front of her.

The door swung open, and William got out, grabbing her without a word and shoving her into the passenger seat.

"William! I didn't say I was going with you!"

The only response was the heavy slam of the car door.

William quickly locked the doors and hit the gas, speeding away from the reporters.

Victoria glared at him, both angry and anxious, "Are you trying to make things worse?"

William's expression was equally grim, a cold smile playing on his lips, his words dripping with sarcasm, "His engagement upset you that much?"

Victoria frowned, "I'm talking about what just happened."

"Drawing at your ex's engagement party, and so seriously too. You looked like you were about to cry. How much do you still like him? Are you planning to elope with him?"

Hearing his increasingly outrageous accusations, Victoria's face turned cold, and she snapped back, "Yeah, I still like him! I can't stand seeing him in trouble! So what?"

She was just going along with his words, but William's reaction was intense. He slammed on the gas, the car speeding wildly down the road.

The winding mountain road and the increasing speed made the car tilt dangerously at every turn.

Victoria was terrified, clutching the handle tightly, her voice trembling, "Stop! Please stop!"

William seemed not to hear, alternating between the gas and brake pedals, his eyes dark and fixed on the road ahead.

"William! You're crazy! You might not care about your life, but I don't want to die!"

William finally reacted. "Do you still like him?" he asked coldly.

"Whether I like him or not is none of your business!"

The car swerved sharply, throwing Victoria against the door, her forehead hitting the window hard.

"I'm asking you one last time, do you still like him?"

The tires screeched against the pavement, making a piercing noise.

"You're insane! No, I don't like him anymore! I don't like him!" Victoria screamed.

But William didn't slow down; instead, he drove even faster, more recklessly.

She was terrified, tears streaming down her face, her voice choked and hoarse, "Please, stop. I'm begging you."

William's eyes were cold, showing no sign of relenting. He glanced at the rearview mirror and said in a low voice, "Stop crying. Look in the mirror."

Victoria followed his gaze, looking into the rearview mirror. There were only a few cars on the road, but she noticed something unusual: two black sedans were tailing them closely, even through multiple turns.

Her heart sank. Her first thought was that they were persistent reporters.

But on second thought, it didn't seem right. Reporters wouldn't dare provoke William like this unless they wanted to ruin their careers.

Seeing her confusion, William's lips curled into a cold smile, his eyes fierce, "It seems some people can't wait any longer."

Victoria looked at his profile, completely puzzled.

Some people? Was he talking about business rivals?

At that moment, more cars appeared in the rearview mirror, all black, like dark phantoms closing in on them.

Samuel's engagement party was in the suburbs, and the road was desolate, lined with a few abandoned factories, giving off an eerie vibe.

William frowned slightly. The other side was coming on strong, clearly prepared.

He gritted his teeth and muttered, "Looks like he's serious this time."

Despite the disdain in his voice, Victoria could sense that the situation was serious.

She sat up straight, nervously looking back at the pursuing cars, and asked anxiously, "What do we do now?"

Before she could finish, the car jolted violently, throwing her against the door again, making her cry out in pain.

She looked ahead and saw two large trucks blocking the road at an intersection, completely cutting off their path.

###chapter 221 Pursuit

The recent harrowing scene had Victoria's heart nearly stopping from fear.

Their car had almost crashed head-on.

With no other choice, they were forced to turn onto a narrow mountain road. William's brow was furrowed, his stern face heavy with concern. In a deep voice, he said, "Victoria, send Harry our real-time location."

Victoria quickly pulled out her phone, her fingers flying over the screen as she sent Harry their location.

On this mountain road, it seemed like it was just their car and the relentless pursuers behind them.

William's foot stayed firmly on the gas pedal, the car's speed not decreasing but steadily increasing.

Victoria knew those people had deliberately driven them onto this road. The thought made her palms sweat, a sense of foreboding rising within her. She was certain those people wouldn't give up easily.

After sending the message, Victoria was still nervous and couldn't help but ask, "Why didn't you let me send the location earlier?"

William had noticed they were being followed much earlier but only told her to send the location after she asked. This puzzled Victoria.

Seeing his calm demeanor, Victoria wondered if he already had a plan?

William heard her question and was silent for a moment before a slightly awkward smile tugged at his lips. He joked, "I thought I could lose them with my driving skills."

Victoria looked at his somewhat guilty expression, feeling both amused and exasperated, momentarily at a loss for words.

But somehow, his half-joking remark seemed to ease her panic a bit.

Even though they had sent a distress signal to Harry, the situation was still dire.

The car sped along the winding mountain road, the engine roaring deafeningly, making Victoria's adrenaline spike.

The vehicles behind them pursued like phantoms. Amid the noise, Victoria faintly heard the sound of rushing water. She instinctively looked out William's window.

Her heart sank. The road passed by a cliff, below which a raging, turbulent river flowed.

Several times, the cars behind them nearly caught up, clearly intending to force their car to stop.

As they passed another fork in the road, a black SUV suddenly barreled down from the side road.

The driver probably never expected so many speeding cars on this mountain road at midnight.

With a sharp screech of brakes and a loud crash, it collided violently with one of the pursuing cars.

Inside their car, William's grip on the steering wheel tightened, his knuckles turning white.

Victoria was so scared she covered her mouth, forgetting to scream.

William quickly glanced in the rearview mirror, but the smoke and chaos from the crash made it impossible to see if anyone in the other car was still alive.

He immediately shifted gears and accelerated, trying to shake off their pursuers.

Victoria slumped against the seat, her legs weak, still in shock.

William noticed her pale face out of the corner of his eye and asked, "Are you okay?"

Victoria took a deep breath and shook her head.

The cars behind them showed no signs of stopping, relentlessly speeding past the crash site to continue their pursuit.

Victoria watched the chaotic scene behind them, her heart pounding.

This was the second time she faced such a life-and-death moment.

The first time, she had been kidnapped and buried alive, thinking she was surely going to die, until William showed up and saved her.

Now, the threat of death loomed again.

She wasn't afraid of dying, but she couldn't bear the thought of what would happen to Alvin if something happened to her.

Thinking of this, Victoria suddenly started crying, tears streaming down her face, sobs escaping her throat uncontrollably.

"Victoria?"

Hearing William's voice, she slowly turned her head, staring at him through tear-filled eyes.

William frowned at her, his tone unusually gentle, "Don't be afraid, I'm here."

Victoria stared at him, and whether it was the lighting or something else, William's handsome face seemed to have a faint blush.

For some reason, his reassurance inexplicably made her feel a bit calmer.

The people behind them seemed to realize that forcing them to stop wasn't easy and crazily decided to speed up and ram them directly. The madness of it sent chills down her spine.

Victoria gripped the handle above her head tightly, her fingers turning white from the pressure. She looked at William, and in this extremely tense moment, a bizarre thought crossed her mind-if she was with him, even facing death didn't seem so bad.

William seemed to sense her gaze and turned to meet her eyes, his face showing no panic, but rather a hint of a roguish smile.

He raised his chin and asked, "Do you think we'd die faster if they rammed us or if we drove off the cliff?"

His tone carried a strange excitement, as if they weren't the ones being chased and on the brink of death, but characters in a game he controlled, where life and death were just part of the thrill.

Victoria followed his gaze to the cliff below, seeing the raging river. If they fell, it wasn't just a matter of the car being destroyed; even if it didn't explode, they could drown in the water.

She shivered but knew that if those people caught them, their fate wouldn't be any better.

Victoria took a deep breath, trying to stay calm, her voice trembling but resolute, "Either way, we die."

Facing a dead end no matter what, they might as well take a leap of faith. Maybe they could find a slim chance of survival in the midst of despair.

After all, with so many cars chasing them, if they were taken elsewhere, it would be even harder for Harry to find them in this remote area.

With this thought, her hand slowly moved to the door lock, ready to face death, determined to go down fighting.

William glanced at her, a flicker of admiration in his eyes. He smirked and chuckled, "Hold on tight."

As a sharp turn appeared ahead, he floored the gas pedal, the car crashing through the guardrail and plunging toward the seemingly all-consuming river below.

###chapter 222 Falling into the River

Victoria's eyes widened, her pupils contracting sharply!

The wind roared in her ears as she plunged into the icy, bone-chilling water, the murky liquid burning her lungs.

A few minutes later.

When William dragged her onto the shore, they looked like two ghosts crawling out from the depths of the River Styx, utterly disheveled and far from presentable.

They lay exhausted on the riverbank, their faces pale as paper, devoid of any color.

The moment the car plunged into the water, the windshield shattered instantly from the massive impact.

Fortunately, they had been prepared. The car doors weren't locked, and Victoria and William used all their strength to escape before it was completely submerged and dragged down by the rushing river.

The river surged violently, and by the time Victoria finally made it to the shore, she realized they had been carried hundreds of feet downstream from where they had fallen in. The cliff and the road were long out of sight.

She coughed out the water she had swallowed, her face expressionless, not knowing how much she had gulped down in the chaos.

The rocks beneath her were uncomfortable, but compared to the bone-chilling cold that had seeped into her body, this discomfort was nothing.

Her clothes were soaked through, clinging tightly to her body. Victoria's teeth chattered uncontrollably as she shivered from the cold.

The harrowing struggle for survival had made her acutely aware that they had just danced on the edge of death. A slight misstep, and they would have been gone.

William, catching his breath, coughed violently but then burst into laughter, as if their brush with death was just an exhilarating adventure, thrilling and fun.

He turned to look at Victoria, who was staring back at him.

Victoria gazed at his face, lost in thought.

She couldn't help but wonder what William would look like if he ever showed fear. If she hadn't known some of his childhood stories from Harry, she might have suspected that something had happened to him as a child, making him so crazy.

Victoria was numb from the cold, her teeth chattering uncontrollably. The biting wind by the river made her shiver even more.

William looked at her, frowning slightly, his eyes full of confusion. "Are you cold?" he asked.

Victoria felt a wave of helplessness. She wanted to roll her eyes at him but was too cold and exhausted to even make that small gesture. She weakly retorted, "Aren't you?"

William stared at her, his tone calm. "I'm okay."

He really was okay. After the initial cold, warmth began to seep back into his body, though it wasn't exactly comfortable. It was still early spring, and the weather was cold, especially after being in the water.

William, however, found the current atmosphere oddly pleasant.

He rolled over and moved closer, water droplets falling from his face onto Victoria's, a playful smile on his lips. "Surviving a disaster, shouldn't we celebrate?"

Under Victoria's gaze, William slowly leaned down, his cold lips gently pressing against hers, carrying the chill and taste of the river, as if trying to infuse the thrill of their near-death experience into the kiss.

At first, it was just a light touch. He closed his eyes slightly, gently brushing her lips, as if confirming something, or maybe comforting her.

Then, William applied a bit more pressure, prying open her cold-closed lips, his tongue exploring and claiming.

Victoria was completely stunned by his kiss. She lay there, dazed, as William's arm wrapped around her slender waist, holding her tightly.

After a while, she finally regained her senses and kicked his foot, angrily shouting, "William, what the hell are you doing!"

William gazed at her flushed face, his eyes growing more intense. His hand slid to her chest, caressing through the thin fabric of her dress, his deep, magnetic voice carrying a hint of seduction. "Aren't you cold? Let me warm you up."

"I..."

Victoria barely got the word out before William's lips covered hers again. His lips were cold, but his tongue was hot, sending electric shivers through her body, making her go weak.

His grip on her tightened, and Victoria could clearly feel their body heat rising rapidly.

William's eyes shone brightly, like stars in the night sky, radiating a dazzling brilliance.

Victoria's heart raced, her mind going blank. All she could hear was the pounding of her heart.

Fortunately, William hadn't completely lost his senses. Though he enjoyed the intimacy, he knew not to go too far. Finally, he released her, panting slightly. "We should get going."

They weren't familiar with the area, but they couldn't stay put. To avoid being found by those chasing them, they had to head into the woods by the river.

Hopefully, Harry would see the message and come find them soon.

The bare trees stood desolate, the ground covered in weeds, making it barely passable. Victoria followed William, struggling with each step.

The leaden clouds hung low, almost within reach. Victoria fervently hoped it wouldn't rain. In this desolate place, if it rained, they wouldn't find any shelter.

Her soaked clothes clung to her, each step feeling like it added pounds of weight, making it increasingly difficult to move.

Victoria was so uncomfortable that she considered taking off her wet jacket, but after a moment's thought, she dismissed the idea. Taking it off might make her even colder.

She then noticed that William was only wearing a shirt and pants. He had taken off his jacket and thrown it in the back seat before they started driving.

Victoria's teeth chattered, her body shivering uncontrollably. In contrast, William walked leisurely, hands in his pockets, his collar open, looking completely unbothered. The difference between them was stark.

Sensing her gaze, William turned his head, his expression relaxed and casual. "When do you think Harry will find us?"

"I don't know." Victoria shook her head slightly, then asked, "Who are these enemies of yours this time?"

William paused, then walked back to her side, looking unperturbed. "I have an idea."

A mocking smile played on his lips. "Maybe they're desperate."

His tone was nonchalant, but Victoria detected a hint of sarcasm. She frowned slightly. "Why?"

William glanced at her, his deep eyes locking onto hers. "Once I deal with them, I'll tell you."

Then, he could be with her without any worries.

###chapter 223 Escape from Trouble

Victoria was freezing and feeling miserable. She tried to wring out the water from her clothes to lighten the load.

William noticed her struggle and instinctively reached out to help wring out the hem of her dress.

Watching their actions, Victoria suddenly found the scene amusing and couldn't help but ask, "Ever been chased like this before?"

William tilted his head slightly, pondering for a moment as memories surfaced. "A few times, but I wasn't exaggerating. I used to be able to shake them off with my skills."

Victoria thought to herself, 'This guy is really something, always making dangerous situations sound like a game. I can't tell if he's truly capable or just careless.'

But judging by how he handled things earlier, he didn't seem inexperienced. He must have faced many dangerous situations over the years.

They walked and stopped intermittently on the rugged path, unsure of how much time had passed.

Victoria estimated that even if they retraced their steps now, it would be hard to find the spot where they had come ashore.

William alternated between walking beside her and scouting ahead. After a while, he habitually looked back to check on Victoria, only to find she had fallen far behind.

He quickly walked back, ready to ask if she was okay, but saw her slowly lift her head, her cheeks unnaturally flushed, and her eyes filled with exhaustion.

William's heart tightened. He hurried to her side and gently touched her forehead, feeling the heat. "You seem to have a fever."

Victoria weakly touched her face, realizing it was burning hot. She really did have a fever.

No wonder she felt like her body was getting heavier and heavier. She had thought she was finally warming up, but it was actually the fever.

"Your constitution is really something," William couldn't help but tease. Then, without hesitation, he squatted down in front of her and patted his back. "Get on, I'll carry you."

Victoria didn't hesitate, leaning onto his back and wrapping her arms around his neck. "Your constitution is the unusual one."

William carried her forward, his tone smug. "Thanks for the compliment."

After a while, Victoria mumbled something in a daze. William turned his ear to her. "What did you say?"

Victoria exhaled warmly and raised her voice. "I said, I want to pass my constitution to you, and my illness too."

William could feel Victoria's face pressed against his neck, her cheek's heat seemingly penetrating his skin.

"Alright," he said softly, "give it all to me."

Victoria was light, and William carried her for a long time, feeling the already gloomy sky grow darker.

Her clothes were wet, but her face was burning hot.

Victoria fell asleep on his back, or rather, her fever worsened.

At first, she could still chat with him intermittently, but later, when William called her, she barely responded.

William had never felt Harry was this slow before, growing increasingly frustrated, thinking he would dock Harry's bonus for the entire year.

In the dim forest, faint sounds emerged. William looked up and saw a few beams of light in the distance. He put Victoria down and shielded her, recognizing the group with flashlights.

He sighed in relief, seeing Harry and Alvin leading the group.

William hadn't expected to see Alvin here, and a sense of foreboding crept into his heart.

"Victoria."

Hearing the call, Victoria woke up abruptly and hurriedly pulled away from William's embrace. "Dad."

The swelling on Victoria's lips was too obvious for Alvin to miss.

He looked at her with a mix of disappointment and heartache, his lips tightly pressed as he suppressed his anger. "Come with me."

William glared coldly at Alvin, a mocking smile on his lips, his eyes full of provocation. "Alvin, she's not your possession."

Alvin finally focused on William, and the next second, he swung a punch.

Victoria's heart skipped a beat. Without thinking, she instinctively rushed forward, spreading her arms to shield William.

Alvin was shocked and stopped his punch abruptly.

William stared at the small figure in his arms. She was petite, just reaching his chin, her face flushed from the fever, yet she was trying her best to protect him.

In that moment, William felt a warm current flow through his heart, filling the usual restlessness and emptiness with her protective gesture.

Victoria slowly opened her tightly shut eyes. Realizing what she had done, she panicked and broke free from his embrace, stumbling back. "Dad, I..."

She was filled with regret, knowing she had made a big mistake. She kept asking herself inwardly, 'What was I doing? Why did I protect William?'

Alvin glared at her for a long time before gritting his teeth and saying, "Come here, I'll carry you to the hospital."

"Okay." Victoria lowered her head and obediently lay on his broad back.

William watched Victoria, her head drooping as she lay on Alvin's back, unable to calm down.

It wasn't until he got into the car that he seemed to snap out of it, pulling out a cigarette and lighting it.

The gray smoke quickly filled the car, blurring his vision.

***

Victoria felt like she was in a scorching desert or a humid tropical rainforest. Her body was unbearably hot, and her head was heavy.

When she woke up earlier, she saw Alvin sitting by her bed with a stern expression. The white walls and sheets made her realize she was in a hospital.

Her thoughts were slow, and her breathing was heavy. Alvin touched her forehead and told her to keep sleeping if she felt uncomfortable.

Victoria vaguely remembered that she and William had been walking in the woods, and now Harry and Alvin had found them. They were safe.

Thank goodness.

She relaxed and fell back into a deep sleep.

When she woke up again, she was drenched in sweat, tiredly opening her eyes. The room was dark, indicating it was late at night.

She moved her body, feeling somewhat better, though still dizzy.

Turning her gaze to the side, Victoria was startled to see someone sitting by her bed.

###chapter 224 He'll Get You Killed

Through the dim light filtering in from the streetlamp outside, Victoria could just make out that the person sitting by her bed wasn't Alvin, but William.

Victoria felt her throat had recovered enough to speak, so she croaked out, "Can you not sit by my bed without saying anything?"

The room was still dark, with no lights on, making everything seem even more shadowy.

William remained silent, his head turned to the side.

Victoria was puzzled, not understanding what was going on with him.

The silence in the room grew, and Victoria began to wonder if the figure she was seeing was just a fever-induced hallucination.

'Fine, if he doesn't want to talk, let him be,' she thought.

Victoria's breathing was heavy as she closed her eyes again, soon falling back into a deep sleep.

In the middle of the night, she vaguely felt someone holding her. The person was warm, pressed tightly against her.

She guessed it was William.

Victoria didn't push him away. Her face was hot, and her breath was warm, but her limbs were cold, making her feel unusually chilly.

William rested his head on top of hers, his arms wrapped tightly around her.

In his embrace, Victoria felt like she was being warmed by a heater, feeling an unusual sense of peace.

When she woke up the next morning, William was gone.

Victoria was still feverish, but she felt much better than the day before.

She spent the morning in her hospital room, and Alvin came to see her once, his face still extremely grim, not saying much.

From him, Victoria learned that she would need to stay in the hospital for a while longer for some tests to check for any other complications.

In the hospital room, all she did was sleep and eat. Because of her fever, she couldn't taste anything, making every meal feel bland.

Her phone had been retrieved from the river, and Alvin brought it to her. The phone was completely ruined, but fortunately, the SIM card was still usable.

Victoria inserted the card into the new phone Alvin had bought for her. When she turned it on, a news article popped up on the browser: #Chain Car Crash on Mountain Road Near Silvermist City, Scene Shocking.

Having survived the ordeal, Victoria was curious about how the incident was reported.

She clicked on the article, which briefly described the car crash on the mountain road that resulted in seven deaths. One of the images was of the two cars that had collided the day before.

None of the images showed the faces of the victims, just a few distant shots of bodies covered with white sheets.

Victoria frowned at the picture.

The people who had been chasing them were dead.

Did William do it?

Probably not.

He was with her the whole time.

Victoria scrolled down and saw a pinned comment.

[My uncle works at the police station. He told us this crash isn't as simple as it seems. It might be related to a personal vendetta.]

The comment had many replies, most of them expressing curiosity about the details of the crash.

But the commenter hadn't replied to any of them.

Victoria got out of bed to pour herself a cup of hot water, watching the few people passing by outside.

Feeling cooped up in the hospital room, she put down the cup after drinking and opened the door. Before she could step out, two burly men in black suits and sunglasses standing on either side of the door turned to look at her.

Victoria fell silent.

She quietly stepped back and closed the door.

These two were probably bodyguards sent to protect her, but she didn't know if they were arranged by Alvin or William.

The sight of them had been a shock, and she sat back on the bed, picking up her phone. She noticed that the commenter had replied to their own comment.

[The cause of death for these people wasn't the crash. It was a vendetta. My uncle told me this in secret.]

This reply sparked even more curiosity, but also some skepticism.

[Nice story.]

[What's your uncle's name? Badge number?]

[The news said they died in the crash. If you're making up stories, at least check the facts!]

The skeptical replies seemed to anger the commenter. Victoria refreshed the page and saw that they had added two more replies:

[Believe it or not, what do I gain from making this up?]

[Let me tell you more. Their throats were slit. When the police found them, they were already dead.]

Victoria wanted to see what else the commenter would say, but the network lagged. When she reloaded the page, the comment and all its replies were gone.

She scrolled through the comments, finding only scattered remarks from other users.

Victoria didn't dwell on the comment, thinking it was too far-fetched. Though she was curious about what happened to the pursuers after she and William fell into the river.

If she asked William, he probably wouldn't tell her. Otherwise, he would have mentioned it last night.

***

Victoria stayed in the hospital for two more days. When she was fully recovered, Alvin came to take her home.

Seeing his still grim face, Victoria felt uneasy and didn't dare to speak on the way home.

Once they were back, Alvin turned to her, glaring angrily. "What did you promise me before? Why are you still entangled with him? He'll get you killed, don't you understand?"

Victoria stared at Alvin, stunned. He had always been loving and gentle with her, never scolding her so harshly.

When he found out that Victoria and William had gone off the cliff together, he nearly broke down. The thing he had feared most had happened-Victoria got into trouble because of William.

Thankfully, they both survived without life-threatening injuries.

But just knowing the details was enough to understand how ruthless William could be.

Victoria had narrowly escaped this time, but what about next time? And the time after that?

Alvin couldn't bear to think about it. He couldn't allow Victoria to continue being involved with William.

"I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't want to lie to you. I really do love him." Victoria bit her lip, her eyes reddening as she looked down at her feet. "I thought being with Samuel would help me forget him, but I can't. I just can't."

Alvin suddenly turned and slapped her hard.

Victoria was stunned, holding her cheek as she stared at Alvin in disbelief. He had never hit her before.

"Victoria! No matter what sweet lies William has told you, remember this: his parents died because of me! Do you think you mean more to him than his parents? He's using you to get revenge on me! I warned you to stay away from him, but you didn't listen. He paid you to sell your body, and you fell for him? Are you really that willing to degrade yourself?"

###chapter 225 Please Disappear

Victoria stood frozen, her mind racing.

"If you keep seeing him, you're no daughter of mine!" Alvin shouted before storming upstairs.

Victoria stared at the empty living room, tears streaming down her face.

After a moment, she wiped her tears away, grabbed her bag, and ran out of the house.

As soon as she stepped outside, her tense nerves finally relaxed. She kept her head down, walking aimlessly, tears flowing uncontrollably, occasionally wiping them away with her hand.

"Why are you crying?"

The sudden voice startled her. She looked up in surprise.

William, frowning, exhaled a puff of smoke, then stubbed out his cigarette. He walked over quickly, taking off his jacket and draping it over her shoulders.

Seeing her face, his expression darkened. "Did Alvin hit you?"

Before she could respond, his eyes turned cold, and he started to march back towards the house to confront Alvin.

He couldn't bear to hurt Victoria, and Alvin dared to lay a hand on her?

Victoria snapped out of her daze and grabbed his arm, shouting angrily, "Can you stop causing trouble for me? I'm in this mess because of you!"

William halted.

"I've paid my dues, haven't I? I'm begging you, disappear from my life! I don't want to see you again! I don't want any more ties with you. Just let me go. Whoever you like, whoever you want as your girlfriend, it's none of my business!"

She clutched his collar, her emotions spiraling out of control. "Am I that unlucky? Why do you treat me like this? I've given you everything I could, almost lost my life for you multiple times. I just want a peaceful life now. Why can't you let me go? Why?"

She cried until she had no strength left, collapsing to the ground, hugging herself tightly, gasping for breath.

William watched her quietly for a while, then turned and left.

Soon, his car started and slowly drove out of her blurred vision.

William had his pride, more so than most men.

The fact that he didn't get angry at her accusations was already remarkable.

However, Victoria's mood didn't improve with his departure. Instead, she felt even more oppressed, a wave of indescribable loss washing over her.

***

As Victoria wished, her life returned to calm.

Even the dramatic moment when William declared their relationship at Samuel's engagement party, along with the subsequent chase, didn't stir up much of a buzz online.

When the hospital called, Victoria hesitated for a moment but decided to go.

Nora's attending physician, Dr. Myers, looked serious as he spoke to them. "Bobby ultimately refused."

Victoria wasn't surprised. It would have been strange if Bobby had agreed.

In this regard, Bobby was no match for Ella.

Bobby would rather go back to prison than harm himself for Nora, while Ella was willing to give Alice a kidney for William. Such courage wasn't common, though it wasn't something to be encouraged. After all, there weren't many people "foolish" enough to do that.

"Finding a suitable kidney donor is very unlikely. Given Nora's current condition, she won't last long. So, I hope you can prepare yourselves mentally."

Leaving the doctor's office, Victoria wore a grim expression.

No matter how bad Nora was, she was still her mother. Facing life and death, how could she not worry?

Victoria stood outside Nora's hospital room for a long time before slowly pushing the door open.

Nora looked extremely haggard. Without makeup, her face seemed to have aged decades, her cheeks sunken, skin dull, dark circles under her eyes, and her body emaciated.

Victoria pulled up a chair and sat quietly by the bed.

After a while, Nora opened her eyes. Seeing Victoria, the hope in her eyes quickly faded.

"Thought it was Bobby?"

Victoria's words made Nora agitated, but her voice was still weak and hoarse. "What are you doing here? Checking if I'm dead? Stop pretending to care. Get out, get out!"

Victoria smiled wryly. Even now, she had the strength to curse her, showing how much she truly hated her.

"Dr. Myers is already looking for a kidney donor for you," Victoria said calmly.

Nora sneered. "Why bother? You're the perfect match. Give me your kidney, and I'll live."

Victoria raised an eyebrow. "Why not Bobby?"

"He's different from you! He's the product of my true love. He's suffered so much. How can you bear to hurt him? I'm right, aren't I? You're the most heartless. You'd let your own mother die!"

She cursed viciously, as if all her misfortunes were Victoria's fault.

Victoria didn't argue, used to it by now.

When Nora was tired of cursing, Victoria even fetched her a glass of water, inserting a straw and handing it over.

"I don't need your fake concern!" Nora said, but when Victoria brought the straw to her lips, she couldn't help but drink a few sips.

Her throat soothed, she continued cursing.

Victoria put down the glass, went to the bathroom, and got a towel to gently wipe her down.

"Don't think I'll forgive you for this! I'll tell everyone you're a monster, letting me die when you could save me! You want me dead. You're a murderer!"

Victoria ignored her, continuing to wipe her down.

Maybe her silence angered Nora. Nora raised her hand to hit her, but Victoria easily caught it and pressed it down.

"Monster! You're a curse! If it weren't for you..."

Victoria could recite the rest of her words by heart, but she remained silent.

Then, she found a clean hospital gown and helped her change.

Nora loved beauty and cleanliness, but who cared about that in the hospital? Even hired caregivers couldn't be so meticulous.

Despite Victoria's care, Nora kept cursing.

Finally, Victoria stopped and looked at her. "Does humiliating me make you feel better?"

Nora glared at her, tears welling up. "If it weren't for you, would I be in this state? It's all your fault! You're a jinx!"

Watching Nora's tears, Victoria couldn't tell if she was mourning her lost glory or her harsh fate.

But it didn't matter anymore.

After finishing her care, Victoria faced her calmly. "What I'm about to say will be our last conversation."

###chapter 226 I Won't Do It

Nora cried until she was completely drained, her face going blank and empty.

Victoria looked down and said softly, "Bobby turned down the surgery, so you're still on the waiting list for a kidney."

Nora didn't say a word.

"With your condition, you probably can't wait too long," Victoria paused before continuing, "If you want to live, go find Bobby."

"No way, forget it!" Nora snapped, glaring at Victoria. "Why can't you do it? Why should I go to him?"

Victoria slowly raised her eyes, her voice steady, "I won't do it."

Nora laughed bitterly, like she'd heard the most ridiculous joke, "This is my wonderful daughter! You'd rather watch me die than give me a kidney!"

Victoria didn't flinch, nodding, "Yes, I would."

Nora narrowed her eyes, mocking, "What if it was your father lying here?"

"I wouldn't think twice."

Even though she expected it, Nora was still furious, "Don't forget who gave birth to you!"

Victoria stayed calm, "I don't want to hurt the people who love me for someone who doesn't. Even now, you have a choice. Between Bobby and me, you chose him without a second thought. I'm not heartless; I get disappointed, sad, and even blame myself for not being good enough. It wasn't until I almost ended up on the operating table last time that I realized the problem was never me. To you, I'm nothing."

Victoria's face remained composed as she spoke her truth.

"You're just making excuses! You're heartless and cold-blooded! Even if I die, I won't let you off! I'll haunt you as a ghost!"

Victoria had said all she needed to and got up to leave.

As she walked out of the hospital room, the cursing inside turned into low sobs, then heart-wrenching wails.

Victoria left without looking back.

***

The entrance exam for the University of Aesthetics Shine had arrived.

Although Victoria was confident she could pass, she didn't dare to be complacent.

It wasn't until she finished all the exams that she finally breathed a sigh of relief.

As she was about to leave the University of Aesthetics Shine to return to work at Starry Studio Gallery, she saw Samuel near the office of the university's president, Albert.

He looked very different. If he used to be calm and elegant, now he seemed mature and gloomy.

He was talking to Albert, who had a regretful expression on his face.

Sensing someone looking at him, Samuel glanced over.

When their eyes met, he froze for a moment.

Victoria gave him a slight smile and nodded, intending to leave.

Unexpectedly, he quickly said goodbye to Albert and chased after her, "Wait."

Victoria didn't stop.

Samuel hurriedly ran a few steps to block her path.

"Running away as soon as you see me? Am I that scary? No matter what, even if we're not a couple, we're still friends, right?" Samuel said with a bitter smile, looking at her delicate profile, feeling a sudden warmth in his eyes.

Victoria was amused by him, her initial awkwardness easing, "How have you been?"

He forced a smile, "Honestly? Not great."

He was always honest with her.

"But there's some good news. My dad's surgery was quite successful."

"Really? That's wonderful!" Victoria was genuinely happy for him.

"Thanks," he said, then chuckled, "When did we get so formal?"

Victoria's smile faded, her expression sincere, "Samuel, I've always wanted you to be happy."

"Happy? Yeah, happy. I don't even know what that feels like anymore."

His words were a mix of truth and sarcasm, making it hard to read him.

Even after they parted, Victoria felt uneasy.

Though their time together wasn't long, she knew him well enough. His eyes were full of exhaustion and pain.

"You're here for the exam, right?" Samuel suddenly changed the topic.

Victoria nodded.

He smiled, "Congrats, you'll definitely pass."

Victoria smiled back, "Thank you."

Samuel smiled again, "Too bad I can't teach you anymore."

Victoria was momentarily stunned, "Why?"

A hint of sadness flashed in Samuel's eyes, "I resigned. My dad's health can't handle managing the company anymore. The company is my dad and grandpa's legacy. I can't let it fall apart because of my selfish interests."

Victoria was silent for a while before slowly speaking, "That's a real shame."

He was an excellent artist and a great teacher.

Samuel took a deep breath and smiled again, "Don't worry, I'll still deliver the two paintings a month to your gallery as promised. You can always ask me for help if you need it."

His words made Victoria's heart ache even more.

Samuel was the best artist she had ever met and the teacher she admired most.

If possible, she wished he could stay at the University of Aesthetics Shine, doing what he loved.

But life is unpredictable.

Suppressing her thoughts, she forced a smile, "Thank you. But don't push yourself. You've already done so much for me. I'll handle the rest."

Samuel's expression turned bitter, "Are you cutting off our last connection too?"

Victoria shook her head, speaking earnestly, "Samuel, it's not me cutting off the connection. You're engaged now. I hope we can both move on."

Her attitude was firm and harsh.

Samuel stared at her for a long moment, then forced a bleak smile, "Alright, I understand. You're right."

With that, he gave her one last deep look, turned, and walked away resolutely.

His figure looked desolate, his steps unsteady, as if he had aged years in an instant.

Victoria stood still, watching him disappear around the corner, tears glistening in her eyes.

Leaving the school, Victoria returned to the gallery to continue working. She had only taken a half-day off, and the accumulated work kept her busy for a long time.

With Alvin's business gradually stabilizing and her artwork royalties coming in, life had become much more comfortable without Nora's burden.

Even so, she continued working at Starry Studio Gallery.

Not only because she had worked hard to get this job, but also because she could learn a lot here. She truly loved this job.

In the afternoon, when she finally had a moment to drink some water, she habitually checked her phone and found several missed calls.

Startled, she quickly checked and saw they were all from Wendy, who had taken a long leave and hadn't been at work for a while.

Victoria's heart tightened. Wendy wouldn't call so many times unless it was urgent!

###chapter 227 Abuse

Victoria immediately called back.

But the phone rang for what felt like forever without anyone picking up.

Starting to panic, Victoria turned to a colleague. "Hey, have you heard from Wendy lately?"

The colleague shook her head. "I sent her a few texts, but her replies were super short. It seemed like she didn't want to talk, so I stopped trying."

Victoria's face grew serious. After dialing four more times, someone finally answered.

Victoria instantly recognized Carol's voice. "Mrs. Clark, where's Wendy?"

"She's not feeling well. She's resting in her room."

"Is she still sick? Should I take her to the hospital..."

Before she could finish, Carol cut her off, "Do you have any other business?"

"Wendy won't be coming to work for a while. She needs to rest at home. I've already informed her supervisors. You guys shouldn't visit her either. I don't want her to be disturbed. That's all."

The call ended abruptly.

Victoria stared at her phone, her brows furrowing tightly. "I need to check on her."

After handing off her work to a colleague, she rushed to Wendy's house as fast as she could.

It was a charming, secluded little house, peaceful and elegant.

"I can't just barge in. Wait here for a bit," Victoria muttered to herself.

She hid behind a row of bushes, her eyes fixed on the house across the street.

Before long, a graceful middle-aged woman emerged from the house. It was Carol, talking on her phone, her expression alternating between happiness and shyness.

Victoria watched her drive away before quickly running over.

She rang the doorbell, but after a while, there was still no response.

Victoria was full of suspicion. 'Could she not be home?'

But she immediately dismissed the thought, 'She has nowhere else to go.'

Unwilling to give up, Victoria circled the house and finally found an open kitchen window.

Without hesitation, she climbed through the window.

Once inside the kitchen, Victoria was stunned, and then a wave of intense anger surged through her.

"How could anyone do this?"

On the kitchen floor, Wendy lay unconscious, her face flushed, her body burning with fever.

In just a few days, her once round face got so thin it was hard to recognize, her chin sharp.

What was even more infuriating was the collar around her neck, attached to a six-foot chain.

This meant Wendy's movements were restricted to just six feet!

Victoria's eyes filled with tears. Though Nora wasn't great, she had never treated her like this.

But Wendy's mother, Carol, didn't even see her as human, treating her like an animal.

Wendy was burning with fever, and Victoria couldn't afford to waste a moment. She frantically tried to remove the collar but found it locked. She needed a key.

Desperately searching the house, she couldn't find the key. Fortunately, she spotted a pair of pliers in the corner. With great effort, she used them to roughly cut the collar off.

Though Wendy was slender, she was unconscious and limp, making it difficult for Victoria to lift her. After a few steps, she was already out of breath, her arms trembling.

Finally managing to get Wendy to the door, Victoria hailed a cab and urged the driver to hurry to the hospital.

Victoria had planned to call the police, but they found her first.

"Breaking and entering?" Victoria exclaimed.

"Yes, and the homeowner reported a lot of important items missing."

Victoria was stunned, her eyes wide with disbelief. "You seriously believe what she said? This is outright extortion!"

And so, Victoria was taken to the police station.

With surveillance footage clearly showing her climbing through the window, the evidence was undeniable.

Sitting in the police station, feeling helpless, Victoria suddenly saw a familiar figure.

It was William!

Victoria quickly turned her head, pretending not to see him.

At the same time, the police chief personally escorted him to the door. William also avoided eye contact.

"Mr. Scott, thank you for your cooperation."

"No problem." William turned and left.

Seeing him leave like that, Victoria felt a mix of emotions but also a sense of relief.

After they had laid everything out, Victoria felt it was best for both of them to cut ties completely. It was the right choice for both of them.

For now, she had to admit, William handled it well.

The police chief came in a while later, glancing at Victoria as he walked in. He called over the officer in charge and whispered a few instructions.

Victoria sat alone, listening to Carol's lawyer's aggressive questioning and the mounting accusations, remaining silent.

She knew that until she saw her own lawyer, saying anything could make things worse.

As for hiring a lawyer, Victoria was determined to apply for legal aid.

She didn't want to make a big scene. If it blew up, Wendy would be the one most hurt. If it left her with any psychological scars, it would be terrible.

Unexpectedly, the police worked quickly, following the clues to find Wendy. Soon, the abuse she suffered at Carol's hands came to light.

There was no hiding it now. The story made the news, causing an immediate uproar in the community. People were outraged, condemning such vile behavior.

Soon, Carol and her husband's identities were exposed, and people online began to remark.

[Carol looks so polished, but how could she be so cruel to her own daughter? She's a wolf in sheep's clothing!]

[That man is no better. Cheating on his wife and neglecting his family. Scum!]

But some people turned their criticism towards Wendy.

[Look at Wendy, her face swollen, smelling bad. She doesn't look like a lady at all.]

[She's so weak. Her own parents abuse her, and she doesn't fight back? I think she's an idiot.]

[Exactly. Being treated like that and not fighting back, she might as well be dead.]

These malicious comments, like daggers, flooded the internet.

Seeing this, Victoria gritted her teeth in anger. "Wendy is the victim here. How can they blame her? Don't they have any compassion?" She had only one thought: Wendy must not see these hurtful words.

Just then, the hospital called. "Come quickly! Wendy Clark's in trouble!"

###chapter 228 Despair

When Victoria arrived at the hospital, a crowd had gathered outside, all pointing and staring at the rooftop. Some were frantically taking pictures with their phones, and the firefighters had already set up an inflatable cushion.

Looking up, Victoria saw the person standing on the edge of the roof.

"Wendy!" Victoria was stunned, her heart clenched tightly, and without hesitation, she rushed into the building.

She sprinted up the stairs, breathless by the time she reached the rooftop. Seeing the police, she quickly explained, "I'm her friend, please let me through."

After confirming her identity, the police let her pass. Victoria ran over and saw Wendy's mother, Carol, was also there.

"What are you doing? Get down here right now!" Carol tried to maintain a facade of calm, but her trembling hands betrayed her panic, and her face was pale.

Wendy stood motionless at the edge of the roof, her figure so frail it seemed a gust of wind could knock her over.

She stared blankly into the distance, ignoring Carol's shouts, as if those cruel words could no longer hurt her.

"Wendy!" Carol couldn't hold back any longer and yelled, "You useless thing, get down here! Who do you think you are, trying to jump off a building? Don't want to come down? Fine, jump then! Even your dad doesn't want you, what's the point of living? If you're going to jump, just do it already!"

The firefighters and police behind her were shocked, "Ma'am! You can't provoke her right now..."

Before they could finish, Carol cut them off harshly, "Why should I care if she lives or dies? She should have disappeared from this world a long time ago! My life has been miserable because of her!"

She was about to continue her tirade when someone suddenly shoved her from behind.

Carol, wearing high heels, stumbled and nearly fell.

"Shut your mouth!" Victoria's eyes were wide with anger, her eyes red, glaring at Carol, "Wendy is such a good girl! If you want to die, then jump! If not, get out of the way!"

"This is a family matter, what does it have to do with you?"

"Get out of the way!" Victoria shouted again.

If the situation weren't so critical, Victoria would have loved to give her a piece of her mind.

She stepped past Carol and walked towards Wendy at the edge of the roof, "Wendy!"

Wendy, who had been unresponsive, slowly turned her head at the sound of Victoria's voice.

"Victoria." She called out softly, her eyes instantly filling with tears, "Victoria, why did you take so long?"

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm late." Victoria cautiously took a step forward, but Wendy, crying, shook her head, "Don't come any closer."

The police behind her quickly pulled Victoria back, whispering, "Don't go too close, it might agitate her."

Victoria stopped and reached out her hand, "Wendy, come over here, it's too dangerous over there. Let's talk over here, okay?"

"They're cursing me, saying I deserve this. Yeah, I deserve this. I don't even deserve to be alive."

Victoria couldn't understand where the bright, confident Wendy she first met at Starry Studio Gallery had gone.

Back then, she was positive, optimistic, and cheerful, as beautiful as a flower, with a stubborn streak. But how had she become so despondent and hopeless in just a few months?

Victoria's heart ached, and tears streamed uncontrollably down her face.

She choked out, "Wendy! Let them say whatever they want. You can live however you want! Don't worry about what others think!"

Wendy's face was streaked with tears, and she kept repeating, "Victoria, why did you take so long? Why?"

Victoria, desperate, took a few more steps forward. "Wendy, this is my fault. I promise, I'll stay by your side from now on, okay? Please come down."

Wendy looked at her and gave a sorrowful smile. "Victoria, I really like you. Working with you these past few months has been the happiest time of my life. But why did you only show up now?"

She kept looking at Victoria, smiling and shaking her head. "Why?"

"No, no, Wendy, don't!"

Victoria sensed something was wrong and, disregarding the danger, lunged forward. "Wendy!"

Wendy closed her eyes slowly, her body leaning back.

"Wendy!"

Victoria's fingertips brushed against her, desperately trying to grab hold, but it was in vain.

People behind her rushed to hold Victoria back. "Don't go!"

"No, no!"

Victoria watched helplessly as Wendy fell before her eyes.

Wendy looked at her, a relieved smile on her lips.

She whispered, "Goodbye, Victoria." 

Victoria sat on the rooftop, curled up into a small ball, her eyes vacant and hollow, her trembling pupils revealing her inner turmoil.

Wendy had jumped, right in front of her.

She hadn't been able to catch her, even though she was so close. If she had just reached out a little further, maybe she could have saved her, but it was too late.

If she had been faster, if she had noticed Wendy's despair sooner.

These thoughts haunted her mind, swirling endlessly.

When William arrived at the rooftop, he saw a devastated Victoria.

The police were talking to her, but Victoria seemed not to hear, her eyes blank and her face as pale as a sheet.

He strode over, signaling to the police that he would handle it, then knelt down, his gaze fixed on Victoria, and called softly, "Victoria?"

Victoria's thoughts were a tangled mess, but that familiar voice managed to pierce through the fog and reach her ears.

She looked up dazedly, her eyes gradually focusing. When she saw it was him, she grabbed his arm, her voice trembling and tearful. "Wendy jumped. What do I do? I didn't catch her, I didn't save her."

She was so lost and helpless, like a child who had lost their way.

William's lips pressed into a tight line, and he pulled her closer, his eyes full of concern. "She's not dead."

"What did you say?" Victoria couldn't believe it, confirming each word.

"The inflatable cushion caught her."

It took Victoria a moment to process this, and she let out a long breath, her body going limp as she leaned against William, her forehead resting on his chest, murmuring, "She's okay, thank goodness, she's okay."

As she spoke, her voice choked up, and she unconsciously tightened her grip on his hand. "You know, she jumped right in front of me. If something had happened to her, I would never forgive myself."

Even though Wendy had narrowly escaped, the harrowing scene would forever be an indelible shadow in her life.

"I know." William's brow furrowed, and he gently hugged her.

He had been in the area on business and had witnessed the whole ordeal.

At this moment, he was more worried about Victoria than Wendy.

For years, Victoria had always seemed strong, having faced life's ups and downs too early. But in reality, she wasn't as invincible as others thought.

On the contrary, she had just learned to hide her vulnerability, suppressing her emotions.

Victoria took a long time to calm down and slowly stood up, feeling a bit embarrassed.

"Thank you," she said softly.

William looked down, his expression becoming distant and cold. "No need to thank me. Anyone would have done the same."

Victoria understood.

He was subtly telling her he was there for her only because of the situation today, and he didn't want her to get the wrong idea about his intentions.

###chapter 229 No Need to See Each Other

Victoria was a sharp observer and gave a slight nod. "Got it."

Just then, her colleague Ember came running over, shouting, "Victoria, Wendy's awake!"

Victoria's eyes lit up immediately. She was about to follow Ember but suddenly stopped and turned back. "I sent the money I owed you for the car repair to Harry."

William pressed his tongue against his teeth, a wry smile forming at the corner of his mouth. "So, I guess we don't need to see each other anymore."

Victoria didn't respond, just turned around and left with Ember.

William took a deep breath, letting the strong wind on the rooftop whip around him, as if only this could clear his muddled thoughts.

"William, you okay?" Alice asked, looking at William, who was standing on the rooftop, lost in thought.

William turned to look at her. "Yeah, I'm fine."

Alice pursed her lips slightly, her expression a bit uneasy, but she quickly composed herself and asked softly, "Do you know why your grandfather urgently called us back this time?"

William was silent for a moment before speaking slowly. "Grandpa's in the hospital again."

Alice had already heard this news from Catherine, but she still pretended to be very surprised and asked with concern, "How's he doing now?"

"His condition's unstable," William said, looking up at her. "Thanks for coming with me this time."

Garth had a poor impression of Alice before, but perhaps due to his serious illness, he had a change of heart and asked William to bring her back to the Scott Manor in Harborview City.

Even though William didn't fully agree with Garth's decision, he would still do his best to fulfill his grandfather's wishes at a time like this.

"William, don't be so formal with me," Alice said, her eyes gentle as she gazed at him. "Besides, your grandfather watched me grow up. In my heart, he's like family."

She gently held William's hand and said softly, "Don't worry, I'll stay by your side."

William calmly withdrew his hand from hers and turned to go downstairs.

***

Fortunately, the hospital wasn't too far, and with proper preparation, Wendy only suffered a fracture and a concussion, with no life-threatening injuries.

Victoria and her colleagues took turns caring for her, and Diana brought her delicious food every day.

But since waking up, Wendy had remained silent.

Carol visited once, standing coldly and looking at Wendy as if she were a stranger. "Are you happy now that I've been trashed by netizens?"

Victoria's face darkened. "Wendy needs to rest."

Carol glanced at her without speaking, then turned her gaze back to Wendy, expressionless. "I've decided to go abroad. I'm leaving in a couple of days. The house is listed with a realtor, and I've packed your things. Someone will bring them to you later."

Victoria looked at her in disbelief. "You're leaving? What about Wendy? What will she do?"

Carol shrugged indifferently. "What does that have to do with me?"

Her indifferent attitude made Victoria furious.

Victoria could empathize with the pain of being abandoned.

"If you feel sorry for her, you can take her in!" Carol sneered at Victoria. "Stop pretending to be a good person!"

With that, she grabbed her bag and left.

Victoria's hands trembled with anger, but there was nothing she could do.

How could some parents abandon their children so easily?

Under the covers, Wendy's eyes were open, tears silently falling onto the pillow.

The next day, Wendy's hospital room was empty.

There was only a letter left on the bed.

Victoria stood at the door for a long time before mustering the courage to pick up the letter.

Just then, footsteps sounded outside, and Diana arrived.

"Where's Wendy?" Seeing the empty bed, Diana was also stunned.

Victoria silently read the letter and said softly, "She's gone."

Diana looked puzzled. "Where? Home? But that can't be right. Carol sold the house. Where could she go?"

Victoria shook her head, looking desolate. "She's left the city for good."

She didn't say where Wendy had gone.

Diana was taken aback and quickly grabbed the letter. "This is ridiculous! She's not fully recovered. Where could she go alone?"

A colleague nearby tried to comfort them. "Wendy's just in a bad mood. Maybe she just went out to clear her head. She'll be back soon."

But Victoria didn't think so. She had a feeling Wendy wouldn't return.

She looked out the window, feeling a deep sense of loss.

It seemed everything had returned to square one.

***

Victoria's exam results came out, and she passed the University of Aesthetics Shine entrance exam with the highest score, transitioning from an auditor to a full-fledged student.

However, Samuel, who had given her the pass, was no longer at the school.

Victoria's life became busier.

From Monday to Friday, she worked at Starry Studio Gallery during the day, attended online video classes at night, and went to school on weekends to attend classes, submit assignments, and write papers. Her days were simple to the point of being monotonous. 

Late at night, the sudden ringing of the phone shattered the silence.

Before long, Alvin came to Victoria's room.

"It's the hospital."

Despite mentally preparing herself, when the moment truly arrived, Victoria found she was far less composed than she had imagined.

Her heart pounded erratically.

"Get dressed. I'll wait for you downstairs." Alvin's voice was low and hoarse.

They hurried to the hospital.

Tony was waiting there. When he saw Victoria, he lowered his eyes slightly and said softly, "Go in and see her."

Victoria's steps faltered before she slowly walked into the hospital room.

Nora lay on the bed, emaciated, her cheeks sunken, and dark circles under her eyes. Hearing the door open, she struggled to open her eyes. "Is it Bobby?"

Victoria bit her lip and stepped forward. "It's Victoria."

"Why is it you?" Nora's voice was weak, and she was so frail that even though she still disliked Victoria, she no longer had the strength to scold or berate her.

"Yes, why is it me?" Victoria's lips curled into a self-deprecating smile. She took a deep breath. "It's ironic, isn't it? You despise me so much, yet here I am, the one by your side in your final moments. Isn't this your karma?"

On the way here, she had repeatedly told herself to stay calm, no matter what Nora said.

But now, she couldn't control her emotions!

She couldn't accept that even at the end of her life, Nora's thoughts were still only of Bobby!

What did she mean to Nora?

###chapter 230 He Refused

Victoria's eyes were red as she looked at the frail Nora lying in the hospital bed, a cold smile playing on her lips.

Nora coughed weakly, her gaze fixed on Victoria. "I don't want to see you. Leave."

Victoria felt like a knife had pierced her heart, the pain spreading through her entire body.

"You think I wanted to come?" Victoria laughed softly, stepping back slowly. "I don't want to see you like this! I don't want to hear you talk about Bobby over and over! And I don't want to keep reminding myself that I'm the kid who never had a mother's love!"

She had been through this scene too many times. Victoria should have been numb by now, but the emptiness in Nora's eyes always made it impossible for her to let go.

"You've never looked at me properly. Now you're leaving, and you still won't look at me?" Victoria's shout was followed by a flood of tears.

"I don't ask for much. I just want you to look at me, but you never have." Victoria covered her face, her body trembling uncontrollably. "Not even once."

Outside the room, Alvin clenched his jaw, his fists tightly balled.

Victoria's cries were like sharp needles, piercing his old, unhealed wounds.

Inside, Nora's consciousness was fading, and she was unaware of Victoria's outburst.

All she knew was that the person in front of her wasn't her Bobby.

"Bobby, my dear son, Bobby."

Victoria closed her eyes, tears streaming down her face.

Yes, Bobby.

In Nora's heart, there was only ever Bobby.

Perhaps, even on her deathbed, she wouldn't remember she had a daughter.

Suddenly, a hand grasped Victoria's.

Startled, Victoria looked down to meet Nora's slightly open eyes.

For a moment, there was clarity in Nora's gaze.

"Victoria," Nora said slowly, "do me a favor. Go find Bobby, will you? Bring him here. I want to see him."

Victoria left the room, glanced at Alvin, said nothing, and stepped aside to make a call.

Alvin stood in silence for a moment before entering the room.

Soon, Victoria returned.

Nora seemed a bit more alert, even struggling to sit up, her eyes anxiously fixed on the door.

"Where's Bobby?"

Victoria looked down for a long time before raising her head. "I couldn't reach him."

Alvin looked at Victoria, his gaze steady for a few seconds before he slowly lowered his head.

"You couldn't reach him? What do you mean? That's impossible." Nora's previously calm eyes turned frantic again. "No, it can't be."

Victoria stood across from her, her hands clenched into fists.

"No, Bobby!" Suddenly, Nora coughed up blood.

Doctors and nurses rushed in, trying every possible method to save her. Finally, Tony stopped, looked at Victoria, and shook his head helplessly.

Victoria didn't cry.

She sat on a bench outside, her hands cold, the surrounding commotion feeling distant.

Alvin sat beside her. "You did reach Bobby, didn't you?"

After a long while, Victoria nodded slightly. "He refused."

He wouldn't even come to say goodbye to Nora.

Victoria and Alvin sat in silence.

Nora's funeral was simple, with few attendees.

Afterward, Victoria returned to her daily routine.

***

Time flew by, and after three years of study, Victoria was about to graduate from the University of Aesthetics Shine.

In those three years, she had made a name for herself at Starry Studio Gallery, her performance impressive across the industry.

Diana had high hopes for her, planning to hand over the management of Starry Studio Gallery to her once she returned to the Simpson Group.

But then, Diana's father Hugo Simpson suddenly introduced an illegitimate daughter, Marcella Simpson, who came back from abroad and forcibly took over the gallery's management. Marcella disliked Victoria intensely and often caused her trouble.

At first, Victoria didn't understand why Marcella targeted her so much.

Later, she found out that Marcella was friends with Samuel's fiancée, Hannah, from their college days abroad.

Samuel and Hannah had been engaged for three years but hadn't married yet.

Despite the Wright family's constant pressure, Samuel resisted, focusing on his career, wanting to establish himself before settling down.

The Wright family had supported the Brown family financially and through connections, especially during a crisis three years ago. They had helped Samuel overcome a significant challenge.

Given the Wright family's substantial support, the Brown family was expected to finalize Samuel and Hannah's marriage soon.

However, Samuel was dedicated to his business, believing it wasn't the right time for marriage. He wanted to secure his position first.

This caused dissatisfaction within the Wright family.

Fortunately, Hannah always stood by Samuel, understanding his ambitions and speaking on his behalf to her family.

Though Samuel hadn't given Hannah a grand wedding yet, he was a considerate and romantic boyfriend. He never missed a holiday or anniversary, always preparing thoughtful gifts. When Hannah was unwell, he took care of her attentively, earning praise from her friends.

Even though they weren't married, everyone around them knew it was only a matter of time.

The two families were deeply intertwined in business, making separation difficult.

This was why the Wright family tolerated Samuel's delays, hoping he would soon succeed and provide Hannah with a stable future.

However, to Hannah, Victoria was still a thorn in her side.

Even though Victoria and Samuel had little contact in recent years, Samuel never forgot his promise to provide paintings for Starry Studio Gallery, working in his studio whenever he had time.

This made Hannah uncomfortable.

As her friend, Marcella naturally disliked Victoria and went out of her way to cause her trouble.

###chapter 231 Heading to Harborview City

Alvin's company had been growing like crazy over the past few years. Thanks to his sharp eye for architectural trends, a bunch of landmark projects that mixed innovative ideas with human touches had created quite a buzz in the industry as soon as they hit the scene.

On top of that, Victoria's incredible talent often brought fresh creative inspiration to the table, helping Alvin's company stand out from the competition.

In just a few short years, Alvin's Dreamscape Construction had gone from a little-known firm to one of the top players in the architectural design world.

Victoria was already a bona fide heiress, but the challenges and trials of the past few years had made her more composed and grounded. The external accolades and vanity that others chased were fleeting in her eyes, never truly capturing her heart.

Alvin had tried many times to persuade her to quit her job, but Victoria had her own considerations.

First, she hadn't yet graduated from the University of Aesthetics Shine and didn't want to disrupt her current life plans. Second, she had deep emotional ties to Starry Studio Gallery, where she had worked for many years. The thought of leaving that job was something she couldn't bear.

Her stubborn attitude left Alvin with no choice.

***

Victoria was organizing materials for an out-of-town art exchange event at Starry Studio Gallery.

Her colleague Ember, arms crossed and leaning against the doorframe, frowned and asked, "Marcella wants you to go with her to the industry exchange event to accept the design award?"

"Yeah." Victoria carefully placed a catalog into a box.

"How shameless can she be!" Ember fumed. "The idea was yours, the design sketches were drawn by you, and even the presentation plan was meticulously prepared by you! What right does she have to take credit for it? And to make it worse, she wants you to accompany her?"

Victoria remained calm. "She's the manager of Starry Studio Gallery, and I'm an employee. It's my job to do more work. For me, every project is a valuable growth opportunity. The experience I gain now will be useful in the future."

Ember shook her head in exasperation. "You're too forgiving."

Victoria looked up at her and smiled, changing the subject. "I'm leaving now. Keep an eye on things at the gallery. If there's any problem, contact me right away."

Victoria finished packing her luggage and took a cab to the airport.

When Marcella saw Victoria, her face instantly darkened.

"Why are you just getting here?"

Marcella looked only a few years older than Victoria, dressed stylishly and exuding the aura of a seasoned professional.

"Sorry, there was traffic." Victoria didn't offer much explanation and headed straight to the VIP lounge.

"Then why didn't you leave earlier?" Marcella pressed on. "Victoria, you should know, I could take anyone. There are plenty of people at the gallery eager for this opportunity!"

"Yeah, I get it." Victoria was used to her attitude and responded accordingly, then greeted the assistant manager, Terrence Wheeler, who was sitting on the other side.

Terrence was known for being easygoing and was leading the team to the industry exchange event.

Seeing Marcella about to continue her tirade, Terrence smiled to ease the tension. "Marcella, we're not at the office. Don't be too harsh."

No matter how much Marcella disliked Victoria, she had to show respect to Terrence.

He was Hugo's trusted aide, and only his age had led Hugo to assign him simpler tasks at the gallery.

Marcella's lips curled into a cold smile. "Since Terrence is speaking up for you, I'll let it go. But you need to be punctual. We can't be waiting for a mere sales assistant!"

Victoria nodded, acknowledging her words.

Soon, the three of them boarded the plane. Terrence and Marcella sat in business class, while Victoria was in economy class.

When booking the tickets, Alvin had offered to get her a first-class seat, but Victoria didn't want to draw attention and booked according to the company's travel policy.

After boarding, Victoria helped Marcella with her luggage, took out her tablet, and settled her in before returning to her own seat.

Terrence praised her, "Victoria is great, diligent and reliable."

Marcella, however, said slowly, "But she's too meticulous, always scheming."

Terrence was taken aback, not understanding her meaning, but didn't ask further, clearly not wanting to get involved in their conflict.

As soon as Victoria sat down, she noticed the young girl next to her was engrossed in her phone, looking at unique and exquisite architectural designs.

The girl sensed Victoria's gaze and turned to her enthusiastically. "Do you like architectural design too?"

"I know a bit about it," Victoria replied, recognizing the designs from Dreamscape Construction, each one a testament to the company's glory and the designers' hard work.

The girl was clearly passionate about architectural design, eagerly sharing her insights on the designs throughout the flight.

From the ingenious spatial layouts to how the exterior harmonized with the surroundings, every detail sparked her deep analysis, and her words were filled with admiration for the buildings.

Victoria was exhausted, having stayed up late the previous night preparing crucial presentation materials and an acceptance speech for Marcella. Marcella's demands were high; the materials had to be comprehensive and beautifully formatted to showcase the company's professionalism and high-end image perfectly.

The acceptance speech had to be unique, making her shine in the news.

Despite her fatigue, Victoria listened attentively to the girl's enthusiastic sharing.

It wasn't until they were about to disembark that the girl reluctantly said goodbye.

The three arrived in the destination city, where the Simpson Group had meticulously booked their hotel.

As soon as the car stopped, Marcella got out and, looking back at Victoria, imperiously ordered, "Victoria, carry my luggage inside."

She then walked into the hotel lobby with an elegant yet haughty stride, immediately putting on a warm smile as she greeted familiar colleagues.

Victoria quietly took care of the luggage and then went to the front desk to check in.

Marcella, having finished her chat, headed towards the elevator, still urging, "Victoria, hurry up."

"Got it." Victoria quickly grabbed the room keys, picked up the luggage, and hurried to the elevator.

Marcella adjusted her hair, standing in the elevator, and gave Victoria a disdainful look. "Can't you move any faster?"

Victoria didn't respond, pressing the button for their floor.

Just as the elevator doors were about to close, a hand reached in, causing the doors to slowly reopen.

The hand was fair and delicate, with long, well-manicured fingers.

Victoria's heart skipped a beat as she saw the hand, and she looked up slowly.

The man outside the elevator was dressed in a dark suit with a light blue shirt underneath, the top two buttons undone. He was tall and handsome, with features that seemed meticulously sculpted, exuding an irresistible charm.

Even Marcella, who was used to seeing attractive men, was momentarily stunned, staring at him for a long time.

###chapter 232 Fleeting Encounter

Victoria instinctively lowered her head and moved closer to the corner after locking eyes with William's cold, intense gaze.

Three years had passed, and she never imagined their reunion would be so sudden and unexpected.

William seemed not to recognize her, or maybe he just didn't care. After stepping in, he turned his back to everyone, pressed the elevator button, and casually slipped his hands into his pockets.

As the elevator ascended, Victoria's heart felt like it was floating in mid-air, only to crash down heavily, over and over, making it hard for her to breathe.

The small space became awkwardly tense.

Marcella stood diagonally behind William, her eyes unblinking.

'No wonder Harborview City is so renowned. Even a random guy here is so outstanding,' she thought.

This time, she had to make a good impression during the exchange event, hoping to attract more excellent men and find a wealthy boyfriend to outshine that bitch Diana!

Marcella, always proud and ambitious, rarely met a man who piqued her interest so much. She was itching to get his contact information but was also mindful of her dignity and status.

Catching a glimpse of Victoria out of the corner of her eye, Marcella decided to make small talk to assert her presence in front of William.

She pursed her lips slightly and turned to Victoria, saying, "The designers attending this exchange event are all industry elites. Since it's your first time here, be smart and don't embarrass our company. Also, did you bring a gown? If not, I have one, but I'm afraid you won't have the grace to pull it off. Just look at your outfit, it's really..."

She smiled without saying more, her disdain evident.

Victoria bit her lip, her face turning pale.

In just a few words, Marcella had elevated herself by belittling Victoria, exposing her situation completely.

Of course, Victoria knew that these words meant nothing to those who didn't care about her.

So if she let it bother her, it would only be her own problem.

The elevator arrived, and the doors slowly opened.

Marcella raised her chin and softly said to William, "Excuse me, sir, could you please move aside?"

Even though she could easily slip past him, she insisted on making William move, her intentions clear to Victoria.

But this time, her plan was likely to fail. William wasn't someone who could be easily swayed.

William slowly glanced sideways, then stepped aside.

Whether intentionally or not, he ended up standing right in front of Victoria.

Victoria pressed her lips together, trying to breathe steadily as she dragged her two heavy suitcases past him.

William's deep eyes narrowed slightly, seemingly indifferent to everything around him. His gaze slowly moved, landing on Victoria's struggling figure.

The elevator doors slowly closed.

Victoria finally let out a heavy sigh of relief.

She had thought about meeting William again, but not like this, purely by chance.

She had imagined their reunion would be a simple, light-hearted smile.

Who could have guessed it would be like this, as if they were strangers?

But wasn't this exactly what she had hoped for?

"What a pity," Marcella sighed regretfully beside her. "He's so handsome and distinguished. It would be great to get to know him."

Noticing Victoria looking at her, Marcella didn't feel embarrassed. She turned and ordered, "Take my luggage to my room."

Victoria silently pushed the two suitcases, her expression calm on the surface, but her mind in turmoil.

She had underestimated William's impact on her. Despite three years of mental preparation, seeing him again easily shattered the facade she had painstakingly built.

Her room was right next to Marcella's. After returning, Victoria threw herself onto the bed, staring blankly out the window.

That evening, there was a banquet.

The venue was the hotel's first-floor banquet hall.

Marcella took this occasion very seriously, dressing up meticulously. Her elegant evening gown accentuated her graceful figure, and she walked with poise, immediately attracting attention as she entered the hall.

The designers invited to this exchange event were all industry elites. Female designers were already few, and young, beautiful ones were even rarer.

Thus, Marcella instantly became the center of attention.

From the moment she appeared, compliments and greetings were endless.

Her smile was radiant, every curve practiced to perfection, clearly aiming to present her best side.

In contrast, Victoria was much more casual, wearing a simple professional outfit, her long hair loosely tied back, and a pair of black-framed glasses adding a touch of elegance.

She had been busy all day, barely having time to eat. Now, her stomach growled with hunger, and she headed straight for the buffet.

She filled a plate with food, looked around, and then carried her tray to a corner by the window, quietly sitting down to eat.

The view from the window was excellent, with the city's bustling night scene in full view.

A gentle breeze brought the warm, pleasant air of early summer, making her feel refreshed.

Tonight's banquet was just a routine event, relatively relaxed with no formalities. Terrence had been called away by a business partner as soon as he arrived at the hotel.

Marcella seemed busy mingling with acquaintances, leaving Victoria with a rare moment of peace.

Nearby, someone was chatting, "Do you know Marcella?"

Hearing the name, Victoria instinctively slowed her eating.

"She's quite notorious in our industry! I heard she's an illegitimate child who, along with her mother, drove the wife to suicide to secure a place in the Simpson family."

"Exactly, with that background, she still struts around arrogantly. It's infuriating."

"Even though she seems glamorous now, who knows how many people despise her behind her back. Every time I see her acting superior, it makes me angry."

Victoria continued eating quietly, trying to make her movements as silent as possible.

She had heard bits and pieces of these rumors before but never delved into them.

To her, even if the rumors were true, it was someone else's past and privacy, not something to judge.

Soon, a sharp scream broke the noise in the hall.

It sounded like Marcella.

Victoria immediately put down her utensils and quickly walked towards the source of the sound.

Marcella stood in the center of the hall, looking disheveled. Her meticulously styled hair was a mess, her gown stained with wine, and her makeup smeared, making her look utterly embarrassed.

The waitstaff hurriedly handed her towels, trying to help clean her up.

Marcella stood there like a statue, her eyes filled with panic and helplessness.

Laughter erupted around her, with people covering their mouths to stifle their giggles.

Some even took out their phones, aiming their cameras at her, ready to capture this "spectacular" moment.

###chapter 233 Do You Really Not Know Her?

Victoria had no clue how the champagne ended up all over Marcella, but now wasn't the time to figure it out.

She quickly stepped forward, taking off her jacket as she walked, and draped it over Marcella's shoulders to cover the mess.

She didn't want Marcella to become the laughingstock of the party, with people snapping photos for their amusement.

"Marcella, let me help you get cleaned up," Victoria said.

Marcella snapped out of her daze, finally noticing the mocking glances around her. She felt utterly humiliated, a mix of shame and anger boiling inside her.

But she couldn't lash out in public, so she directed all her fury at Victoria.

"Where were you?" she demanded angrily, yanking the jacket off her shoulders and throwing it to the ground. "Didn't I tell you not to wander off?"

Victoria's eyebrows twitched slightly, a barely noticeable frown forming.

She understood that Marcella was trying to save face. After a moment, she lowered her gaze and softly said, "It was my mistake."

"I don't even know why I brought you here!" Marcella continued to berate Victoria as she stormed towards the exit. "It's all your fault!"

Clearly, Marcella was used to being pampered, and Victoria felt a wave of helplessness.

Despite her frustration, Victoria had to bite her tongue and just endure it. If she and Marcella had a public argument, it would tarnish the reputation of Starry Studio Gallery, and she didn't want her beloved gallery to become a joke.

Once they were outside the banquet hall, Marcella still wouldn't let up, her righteous indignation making it seem like everything was Victoria's fault.

"Where did you go?" Marcella asked again, her tone harsh.

"I was hungry, so I got something to eat," Victoria answered honestly.

"You're such a glutton!" Marcella snapped, her words cutting. "At a time like this, you have the nerve to eat? Don't you know why you're here?"

Victoria lowered her eyes and calmly corrected her, "I'm an employee of the gallery, not anyone's servant."

Though their tasks often overlapped, there was a fundamental difference between the two roles.

Marcella let out a cold laugh. "You won't be for much longer."

For the first time, Victoria looked up at her, her gaze icy and resolute, sending a chill through the air.

Victoria's lips curled into a slight smile. "So, what are you planning to do?"

"What am I planning?" Marcella's lips twisted into a mocking smile as she headed towards the dressing room. "You'll find out soon enough."

It was both a warning and a threat.

Victoria stood still, her beautiful face calm and emotionless.

She wasn't afraid of whatever scheme Marcella might come up with. At worst, she would leave Starry Studio Gallery.

"What are you standing there for? Come upstairs and help me change!" Marcella urged.

The dressing room was conveniently located upstairs.

Victoria hesitated for a couple of seconds before following Marcella up the stairs.

Once the hallway was quiet, the two men behind the door began to speak.

"William, do you know her?" the younger man asked in a hushed voice.

From the moment the commotion started outside, he had noticed William's unusual reaction. William's expression was cold, his eyes filled with a chilling intensity that made him seem unapproachable.

Leaning against the wall with his hands deep in his pockets, William's eyes were narrowed, making it hard to read his emotions.

But those who knew him well understood that he was exuding a "stay away" vibe.

William's lips curled into a cold smile. "How could I possibly know someone like that?"

Someone like that? What did he mean by that?

Cassius was puzzled, completely in the dark.

He knew William was usually aloof, but this was unusually harsh, especially considering the girl outside seemed to be the one wronged.

"Let's go."

Clearly irritated and impatient, William turned and headed back to the banquet hall.

Cassius, who had sneaked out behind his parents' backs, quickly followed. "William, do you really not know her?"

William shot him a frosty glare, and Cassius promptly shut his mouth.

"Fine, won't ask then. What's the big deal?" he grumbled.

Still, given William's reaction, it was hard to believe he didn't know her.

As soon as William entered the banquet hall, a small stir went through the crowd. Delmar Puckett, the host and the big boss behind the event, personally greeted him with a broad smile, introducing him to various business partners and friends.

William merely nodded in acknowledgment, his face showing little interest.

Only Cassius noticed that William's gaze kept drifting towards the door.

Cassius's eyes lit up as if he had discovered something significant. Could it be that a woman had caught William's attention? He was eager to find out who she was.

Soon, Victoria returned with Marcella, who had changed into another eye-catching dress, this time a striking red gown with a floor-length skirt adorned with sparkling sequins that shimmered under the lights.

Marcella had a tenacious spirit; she was determined to regain her dignity right where she had lost it.

Victoria was slightly taken aback by Marcella's bold choice, but Marcella, head held high, confidently re-entered the banquet hall.

Victoria couldn't help but admire her. If it were her, she might not have had such a positive attitude.

As expected, Marcella quickly became the center of attention again.

Victoria, not wanting to draw too much attention, kept a distance and headed to the lounge area to sit down.

Marcella immediately spotted Delmar, her smile perfectly poised as she approached him. "Mr. Puckett, do you remember me? I'm Marcella from Starry Studio Gallery."

At the mention of "Starry Studio Gallery," the man standing next to Delmar slowly turned his head.

Marcella instantly recognized him as the striking man from the elevator earlier.

Her smile grew even brighter. "Mr. Puckett, who is this?"

Delmar introduced him with a smile. "This is Mr. Scott from the Scott Group."

William gave a slight nod, his gaze quickly shifting away.

"Mr. Scott, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Marcella, the manager of Starry Studio Gallery." Marcella was thrilled, feeling like this was a golden opportunity.

"Mm-hmm." William took a sip of his drink.

Marcella, overjoyed, eagerly raised her glass of champagne. "Mr. Scott, a toast to you."

William barely lifted his glass, not even sparing her a glance.

He seemed to be casually scanning the room, but when his eyes landed on a figure in the corner, he frowned slightly.

Marcella tried to continue the conversation. "Mr. Scott..."

"Excuse me." William set down his glass and headed straight for the corner.

###chapter 234 Do You Know Him?

Cassius was leaning against a pillar, his eyes locked on someone across the room, curiosity written all over his face.

Out of nowhere, someone smacked him on the head.

He spun around, startled, and grumbled, "William! You almost knocked me out!"

"What are you staring at?" William asked, glancing at him with a hint of indifference.

"Nothing," Cassius replied, still peering across the room with a sly grin. "By the way, you really don't know that lady?"

William finally lifted his gaze, his deep eyes reflecting a figure he knew all too well.

"Looks like she's in a bit of trouble," Cassius said, clearly enjoying the drama, while watching William's reaction.

William's face remained as cold as ice, showing no emotion.

Across the room, someone had stopped Victoria. "Miss, haven't we met somewhere before?"

The man, in his forties, was dressed in a sharp suit, his hair meticulously styled.

Victoria, trying to be patient, replied, "I'm sorry, you must be mistaken."

"No, no, I'm sure we've met!"

The man brazenly looked her up and down, even circling around her exaggeratedly. "Let me think, where could it have been?"

Victoria's face darkened, her eyes avoiding his. "You have the wrong person."

She was deliberately avoiding attention. Despite her efforts to keep a low profile, her work had garnered significant attention in the industry, and Dreamscape Construction's recent news had been widely covered. Given the company's reputation, it wasn't impossible for someone to recognize her.

As she tried to walk away, the man suddenly grabbed her arm. "Wait, I remember now!"

Victoria took a deep breath, turned around, and tried to remove his hand. "Sir, whether you remember or not is none of my concern. I'm not interested. Now, let go."

The man ignored her displeasure, still acting smug. "I know who you are. You're..."

Just as Victoria was about to forcefully shake him off, someone suddenly grabbed the man's hand tightly.

"Ow!" The man winced in pain, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.

Victoria stared in shock at the person who had appeared.

William, his face expressionless, didn't even glance at her. He just stared coldly at the man. "Which company are you from? Do all your employees behave so rudely?"

His tone was severe. The man, unsure of William's identity but noticing the growing attention from onlookers, couldn't afford to lose face and refused to back down easily.

"We're in the same industry, just having a normal conversation," the man argued.

William had no patience for his nonsense. Without another word, he flung the man aside.

The man stumbled, his face flushing with anger. He rolled up his sleeves and charged forward. "What the hell..."

"What's going on here?" Delmar, noticing the commotion, hurried over to inquire.

Seeing his boss personally involved, the man's arrogance vanished, and he stood obediently in front of Delmar.

Before he could explain, William impatiently said, "If this is the quality of your company's designers, then consider our collaboration canceled."

Delmar's eyes widened. He turned and scolded the man, "Look at the mess you've made! Apologize to Mr. Scott immediately!"

The man, realizing he couldn't afford to offend anyone, was about to say "I'm sorry" when William interjected, "You should apologize to her, not me."

Delmar reacted quickly, glaring at the man, "Yeah, go apologize to the lady right away!"

"Okay, okay." The man quickly turned to Victoria. "Miss, I'm really sorry, I mistook you for someone else."

Despite his words, his eyes still held a hint of resentment.

Victoria's thoughts were entirely on William, her heart pounding. She couldn't tell if she was more shocked or delighted.

Marcella, who had been observing, found the situation increasingly puzzling.

Her gaze shifted between Victoria and William. What was going on? How could someone like William, the head of Harborview City's leading enterprise, be involved in such a trivial matter?

And the way he looked at Victoria was unusual.

Could they know each other?

But how was that possible?

Victoria was just a small-time gallery employee. How could she know someone like William?

Marcella scrutinized Victoria again, finding the idea absurd. William was surrounded by women, and even if he were to choose, it wouldn't be someone like Victoria-plainly dressed and always buried in work.

Feeling reassured, Marcella's lips curled into a smile, like a spectator enjoying the show.

Victoria didn't want to escalate the situation. After all, she represented Starry Studio Gallery.

So, she accepted the man's apology and explained, "It's okay;, it's easy to mistake someone in a crowd."

She wanted to resolve the matter quickly, but William, seeing her so accommodating, felt a twinge of displeasure.

As the man slunk away, William turned to Delmar, his expression stern. "People like that will ruin your company's reputation."

Delmar, ever the diplomat, quickly understood. "Don't worry, Mr. Scott. He won't be working for us anymore."

Victoria frowned slightly. The man's behavior was inappropriate, but it didn't warrant losing his job.

She was about to speak up when William said to Delmar, "By the way, about the project plans for the second half of the year, could you elaborate?"

Delmar, all smiles, nodded eagerly. "Of course, Mr. Scott. Let's find a place to discuss."

"Sure." William followed Delmar, not sparing Victoria another glance.

Victoria watched his retreating figure, her emotions in turmoil.

She knew he was doing it on purpose.

But she couldn't blame him. William was always proud, and she had deeply hurt that pride.

"Do you know him?" Marcella approached.

Victoria shook her head lightly. "He's the CEO of the Scott Group. How could I know him?"

"Before this, he was quite the figure in Silvermist City."

Marcella looked her over. "You must have heard of him."

"Marcella, you know, just hearing about someone doesn't mean you know them."

Victoria clearly didn't want to continue the conversation. She turned to leave, but Marcella chuckled softly. "I'm curious what that unlucky guy did to provoke Mr. Scott."

Victoria lowered her eyes and walked to the nearby lounge area.

She never liked these social events, always feeling out of place. She had never even attended Dreamscape Construction's annual parties.

As soon as she sat down, someone joined her.

Victoria turned, puzzled, to see a young man beside her.

With so many empty seats around, it was hard to believe he sat next to her by coincidence. But she said nothing, turning her gaze away.

After all, it was his choice. She had no reason to overthink it.

"I'm Cassius Scott. What's your name?" Cassius broke the silence.

Scott?

Victoria looked at him more closely, noticing the resemblance to William, especially around the eyes.

She had a guess. "I'm Victoria Carter. Are you Mr. Scott's cousin?"

"That's right. And you, Ms. Carter? Are you William's ex-girlfriend?"

###chapter 235 More Annoying Than Before

Cassius leaned back, propping his head on his hand, grinning at her like he didn't have a care in the world.

Victoria felt a bit uneasy but still shook her head. "Nope."

Their relationship was complicated, to say the least, but they were definitely not a couple.

"Really? Then why did I see your picture on William's phone?" Cassius lowered his voice on purpose, leaning in closer to make sure she heard him.

Victoria was taken aback. He had her picture on his phone?

In that moment of surprise, a shadow loomed over her.

She instinctively looked up, meeting William's deep, dark eyes. Her heart skipped a beat, and she quickly averted her gaze.

Without a word, William grabbed Cassius by the collar and yanked him away.

"William! William, let go! Everyone's watching! You said you didn't know her, but the moment I got close, you freaked out. So, tell me, are you..."

His voice faded as he was dragged away.

Victoria took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.

Ever since she met him, she had been acting out of character, and she hated feeling so out of control.

Tonight was just an informal dinner, so Victoria decided to head back to her room to rest. She got up and walked towards the door.

Once she left the banquet hall, the inexplicable agitation in her heart began to subside.

She let out a self-deprecating smile.

After all this time, she thought she had managed her feelings well, but his presence made her feel like a fool.

The more she denied her feelings for him, the more ridiculous it seemed now.

The elevator doors opened, and she stepped inside.

Just then, someone followed her in. She turned around and froze, quickly looking away, pretending not to see him.

William glanced at her, then turned to press the floor button. "Which floor?"

It took Victoria a moment to realize he was talking to her. "12th floor, thanks."

"Thanks?" William scoffed, turning his head to scrutinize her. "Victoria, do you know how fake you've become?"

Victoria's brow furrowed, a flash of displeasure crossing her face.

She quickly put on a distant smile, as if they were strangers. "Really? I think I'm doing okay."

William stared at her, stepping closer. Victoria's expression changed, and she pressed herself against the wall, eyes full of caution. "There's a camera here."

He raised an eyebrow, his expression a mix of amusement and mockery. "What are you afraid of? That I still have feelings for you? Or that I'll do something to you here?"

"I'm not."

Victoria realized she had overreacted, feeling a bit self-conscious.

"Or do you think that after three years, I haven't found someone to replace you?" he added.

Victoria looked up sharply, her gaze heavy. "Mr. Scott, these are none of my concern Honestly, I didn't expect to see you here. Sorry if I upset you. Please don't hold it against a lowly employee like me."

William stared at her, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "You still talk as annoyingly as ever. No, you're even more annoying now."

Victoria bit her lip. She had a temper too, and she hadn't provoked him. Yet here he was, picking a fight!

She was fuming inside, and her attitude naturally wasn't great. "In that case, Mr. Scott, you should stay far away from me to avoid getting angry and hurting yourself."

Looking at her face, which hadn't changed much in three years, William squinted his eyes and took another step forward, staring at her. "Is this really what you want to say to me after three years?"

"What else?" Victoria shot back, "What should I say?"

"Yeah, what should you say?" William took a deep breath, his eyes growing darker. "I also want to know, what do you have to say to me?"

Victoria looked up at him, staring straight into his deep eyes.

She pressed her lips together, silent for a moment.

Until the elevator doors opened again, she finally spoke slowly. "What do you want to hear?"

William glanced at her, then decisively closed the elevator doors, and it continued to rise.

"What do I want to hear?" He shook his head, a bitter smile on his lips. Suddenly, he placed one hand on the wall behind her. "You don't know?"

He really wanted to question her harshly!

She knew everything but still pretended to be indifferent.

Victoria turned her head, avoiding his gaze, her voice low. "Mr. Scott, we are from two different worlds."

William gritted his teeth, then laughed. "Since you say so, I won't force it. Honestly, I quite like your body. Out of all the women, only you fit me the best, and you're the hardest to forget."

Victoria's face changed slightly, but she said nothing.

"But this kind of thing should be consensual. Forcing it is no fun." He put one hand in his pocket and casually tidied her slightly messy hair with the other. "After all, we are old acquaintances. If you have any needs, just ask. Of course, you know the price."

Victoria's patience finally snapped. She angrily swatted his hand away. "No need. I'm not the little girl who begged for charity anymore. Save your money for someone else!"

She pushed him away and quickly pressed the button for the nearest floor, ready to leave.

William slowly approached her from behind, his unique scent enveloping her. "Don't be so quick to refuse. You might need me someday."

Victoria glanced at him coldly. "Rest assured, that will never happen!"

The elevator doors opened, and she walked out without looking back.

As the doors closed, the playful look on William's face faded, replaced by frustration. His cold gaze could freeze anything in an instant!

Fine, very good!

After all this time, she was still so calm!

Forget it! A heartless woman like her wasn't worth it!

***

The day after the dinner, there was an annual networking event.

Marcella attended as usual, dressed to impress in a champagne gold mermaid gown with a thigh-high slit. Every step she took revealed her slender legs, and the elegant dress highlighted her delicate collarbones and sexy shoulders. The backless design added a touch of allure.

She was undoubtedly the center of attention. Female designers showcasing their work at such important events were rare, and she was both young and beautiful.

Marcella found her reserved front-row seat and sat down. Colleagues immediately gathered around to chat.

"Ms. Simpson, your project last month was absolutely stunning."

Marcella was in high spirits, covering her mouth with a light laugh. "You're too kind."

Victoria entered the exhibition hall, feeling dizzy.

She had trouble sleeping last night, and the unfamiliar climate made her feel unwell.

She spent the night running to the bathroom, exhausted and pale in the morning, feeling weak all over.

###chapter 236 An Old Friend

As a junior employee, she could only snag a seat in the back row of the audience.

After finding an empty spot, she leaned back and closed her eyes, hoping the event would wrap up soon so she could head back to her room and rest.

Delmar took the stage, officially kicking off the event.

Victoria's head felt heavy, and the host's voice seemed distant and muffled.

It wasn't until Marcella took the stage, greeted by thunderous applause, that Victoria was jolted awake. She forced her eyes open and looked toward the center of the stage.

Marcella, with her elegant demeanor, began with a thank-you speech, then launched into a detailed account of her unique creativity and the challenges she overcame to present the award-winning piece.

Victoria, exhausted, closed her eyes again.

Maybe Marcella's confidence was too overwhelming, or the atmosphere too lively, but the host decided to add an impromptu Q&A session.

Marcella's previously triumphant expression faltered for a moment but quickly returned to her charming smile. "Sure," she said cheerfully.

The audience, full of industry peers, was very supportive. Someone immediately raised a hand and asked, "Ms. Simpson, your design concept is incredibly innovative. How did you get the inspiration to blend traditional elements with modern style so seamlessly?"

"Well, at that time, I..." Marcella maintained her polite smile, but inside, she was panicking. 

This project was from months ago, and she barely remembered the details. Many of the creative ideas had come from Victoria. How was she supposed to answer this suddenly?

But Marcella was quick on her feet. Smiling, she said into the microphone, "Such a basic question. I'll let my assistant answer it."

Then, pretending to be playful, she added, "Come on, ask me something more challenging!"

The host began looking for Victoria. "Ms. Simpson, where is your assistant?"

Marcella raised her voice, "Victoria? Come on up."

To the audience, it seemed like she was giving her assistant a chance to shine. Who wouldn't praise her for being so considerate?

Victoria slowly stood up, her face pale. She stared at Marcella. Others might not notice, but she could see the warning in Marcella's eyes despite her smile.

Victoria remained calm. She believed she was just doing her job. When she learned Marcella would represent Starry Studio Gallery to accept the award, she didn't mind. She certainly wouldn't expose Marcella now.

But she felt so unwell that she had to pinch her palm hard to stay alert.

Taking the microphone from the host, Victoria clearly explained the design concept, the source of inspiration, and the integration process.

She even answered potential follow-up questions in detail.

Someone started clapping, and soon the whole room erupted in applause.

Even Delmar, sitting in the audience, nodded in approval.

If even a junior employee could explain things so clearly, it showed that Starry Studio Gallery was truly full of talent!

Marcella kept smiling, but she was furious inside. She had only asked Victoria to answer a simple question. Who told her to go on and on?

Now it seemed like Victoria was trying to make it clear that most of the credit for the project belonged to her, not Marcella!

Victoria didn't plan to stay on stage. Seeing that the host had more questions, she bowed slightly to the audience and turned to leave.

But after a few steps, she seemed to remember something and turned back.

Marcella's smile froze again. She glared at Victoria and whispered, "What are you doing?"

Victoria ignored her, picked up the microphone, and said firmly, "Just to clarify, I'm not Ms. Simpson's assistant. I'm a full-time employee at Starry Studio Gallery."

She then put down the microphone and walked off the stage steadily.

Delmar smiled, his eyes following Victoria. He turned to the person next to him and said, "This young lady is interesting."

Marcella stood on stage with a forced smile. She was supposed to be the star, but Victoria had stolen the spotlight!

***

The original plan was to return in three days, but Marcella showed no intention of leaving. Terrence, busy with work, had to return to Silvermist City first.

Victoria had planned to go back with Terrence, but Marcella insisted she stay.

"Victoria, you need to remember, you're working for me," Marcella said casually while painting her nails. "I still have some loose ends to tie up here, and I need your help."

Victoria saw Terrence off downstairs. Terrence had a good impression of her and gave her some advice before leaving. "Marcella's dad is our boss. Just go along with what she says. Don't oppose her. She's just a bit spoiled."

"I understand. Thank you, Mr. Wheeler."

After Terrence's car drove away, Victoria stood there for a long time before slowly looking away.

She wasn't afraid of Marcella's pettiness. The real reason she didn't want to stay was William.

"Victoria?" A voice called from behind.

Victoria turned to see a tall, handsome young man standing there. Despite the maturity and worldliness that time had added to his face, his innate vitality was still evident.

Victoria instantly recognized him. It was Alton.

Years ago, Victoria had met him while working on a home exhibition project for the Bridges Group in Silvermist City.

Back then, Alton was cheerful and wealthy, a golden boy in everyone's eyes.

Alton had fallen for Victoria at first sight and publicly confessed his feelings, which led to his ex-girlfriend Sofia injuring Victoria.

William had intervened, and the Moore family had apologized and compensated Victoria, preventing Sofia from being sent to jail.

Later, Victoria was sent by the gallery to Harborview City to work on another exhibition for the Bridges Group, where she worked with Alton again for a while.

After that project, Victoria hadn't seen him again. She had only heard that the Bridges Group's investments had failed, their funds had dried up, and they had declared bankruptcy two years ago.

Alton had gone from a carefree rich kid to an ordinary young man working hard in the corporate world.

Victoria hadn't expected to run into him here.

"Victoria, what a coincidence! I can't believe I ran into you here!"

Alton looked genuinely happy. "How about we find a place to sit and catch up?"

Victoria didn't want to go back upstairs to face Marcella, so she agreed and followed him to the hotel's lounge.

"So, you're here for the exchange event?" Alton asked.

"Yeah, accompanying our gallery manager."

Alton sighed. "Honestly, I admire you. You've stuck to your dreams all these years, not letting anything distract you."

Victoria smiled and looked at him. "Where are you working now?"

Alton pulled a business card from his pocket.

"You're the Sales Director at the Scott family's Infinity Unity Group?"

###chapter 237 Assimilation

"Yeah, ever since my family had that mess, I joined Infinity Unity Group."

Victoria had a sudden thought. "Was it William who got you in?"

He chuckled. "You never miss a beat, do you? Your intuition's still sharp."

Victoria was a bit surprised. "He got you into his family's company?"

Alton's smile was faint, his gaze intense. "Technically, it's his uncle Wayne who runs Infinity Unity Group. As for why, I think you can figure it out, right?"

Victoria had indeed guessed, but she hadn't realized he'd planted this seed years ago.

Alton didn't hold back and spoke openly. "My family hit a crisis, and I lost all support. I had to start from scratch. Even though I graduated from a top university, the competition was brutal, and my family was drowning in debt. My parents' health wasn't great either."

His tone was calm, like he was finally letting out long-held feelings.

"I reached out to a lot of relatives and friends, but none of them were willing to help."

Victoria listened quietly, sighing softly.

She knew all too well the coldness of the world.

Alton's smile was bitter. "In the end, it was Mr. Scott who helped me. He paid off my debts and covered my parents' medical bills. I owe him everything. I swore I'd do anything for him, no matter the cost."

Victoria listened in silence for a long time before asking, "Why are you telling me this?"

"Aren't you his girl?"

Alton's matter-of-fact tone annoyed Victoria. "There's nothing between us. Don't jump to conclusions."

"No relationship? That's hard to believe." Alton seemed to realize something and smiled. "Did you two have a fight? It's normal for couples to argue sometimes."

Victoria let out a mocking laugh. "Have you ever seen a couple stay mad at each other for three years?"

Alton was stunned. "So, you haven't seen each other in three years?"

"There was no need to." Victoria lowered her head and took a sip of tea.

"That's really interesting." Alton leaned forward slightly, looking at her with great interest. "I remember when I drove you back to the hotel, Mr. Scott looked like he wanted to kill me! And you say there's nothing between you two now."

Victoria didn't respond to his diversion.

Alton chuckled. "You've been apart for so long. Want me to fill you in on what's been happening these years?"

"No need." Victoria took another sip of tea. "We've moved on."

"I'm afraid that's just your wishful thinking."

Victoria frowned. "What do you mean?"

Alton looked at her with a mix of amusement and sympathy. "You really don't understand this man, do you? I bet you've been single these past few years, right?"

Victoria retorted loudly, "I have plenty of admirers!"

Alton shook his head with a smile. "I don't even have to think about it. Did all those admirers disappear after confessing their feelings to you?"

"How do you know?" Victoria's eyes widened in shock, staring at Alton in disbelief.

Alton's smile grew even brighter.

He took a slow sip of his tea before continuing. "When you were working at our exhibition hall, a lot of people were interested in you. But Mr. Scott scared them all away, and you had no idea."

Victoria's eyes widened even more, unable to believe it. "Are you saying that William has been..."

"Yes!" Alton said firmly. "Otherwise, with your looks and abilities, how could you have stayed single all these years? The only reason things have been peaceful between you two is because no one around you has made him feel threatened. If someone did, your life wouldn't be so calm!"

Victoria's frown deepened. She hated to think she was being presumptuous.

But what he said made some sense.

Alton watched Victoria. She had become even more captivating over the years, losing some of her youthful naivety and gaining a mature charm.

At this moment, her slightly confused look made her even more endearing. He instinctively raised his hand to touch her head.

But halfway there, he snapped back to reality and pulled his hand back.

He almost made a huge mistake!

He almost crossed William's line!

He remembered when he first joined Infinity Unity Group. William could have helped him with connections, but instead, he let him struggle at the bottom, enduring many hardships.

At first, he thought it was a test. Later, he realized it might have been a form of punishment for daring to covet someone he shouldn't have.

Victoria looked at Alton, who was now smiling helplessly.

His thoughts were written all over his face.

It was because of his trust and closeness to her that he didn't use the usual workplace pretense with her.

Victoria stared at him for a while before suddenly speaking. "Stop overthinking."

Then, she said firmly, "There's nothing between him and me, not the kind of relationship you're thinking of."

Alton smiled. "It doesn't matter what kind of relationship it is. I've just realized one thing: to succeed, you need to align yourself with powerful forces."

Victoria frowned. "Alton, have you been completely assimilated by the system?"

Alton nodded and added seriously, "Completely assimilated."

At that moment, Alton's phone rang.

He glanced at the caller ID, and his smile widened. "Perfect timing."

He answered the call, immediately adopting a respectful tone. "Mr. Scott."

Victoria was startled and looked up at him.

"Yes, that's right. You're correct. Okay, I understand."

He hung up the phone and said with some helplessness, "I have to go. Duty calls."

"I'll walk you out." Victoria followed him out of the lounge. As they reached the lobby, someone called her name.

"Victoria?" Marcella, now wearing a flirty short dress, sauntered over.

She immediately noticed Alton, her eyes scanning him up and down.

Then, she smiled.

Victoria felt a headache coming on.

As Marcella approached, Victoria leaned close to Alton and whispered, "You can still leave now."

Alton, who had worked his way up from the bottom over the years, could tell what kind of person Marcella was at a glance.

This type of woman was the most troublesome.

He quickly nodded to Victoria. "I'm out of here."

With that, he strode towards the door, where his car was already waiting.

"Was that your friend? Why did he leave?" Marcella looked towards the door, noting Alton's attire and the car he got into, clearly impressed.

###chapter 238 Overworked

Marcella's eyes gleamed with a cunning light as she scanned the room. "This city's got a lot of hidden gems, doesn't it?"

Victoria stayed silent. Marcella turned to her, "Victoria, you seem to know a lot of folks around here. Are they all your friends? That guy just now, so cheerful and stylish, he doesn't seem like an ordinary person."

Victoria looked up and replied calmly, "The gallery sent me here for work before. He was a colleague back then."

Marcella narrowed her eyes, "Oh, I see. So, what's he up to now? You must know."

Victoria shook her head, "We haven't seen each other in years. We just had a quick chat."

Marcella's interest faded, and she pouted, "You really missed out on a good opportunity."

Victoria pressed her lips together and stayed quiet.

"I've got plans tonight." With a graceful wave, Marcella swayed her hips and left.

Victoria just wanted to get some sleep. She hadn't been feeling well these past few days, probably due to the intense workload and constant stress.

Now that she had a moment to relax, all the accumulated fatigue hit her at once. She had a low-grade fever and felt weak all over.

She shook her head, trying to stay awake, but as soon as she stepped into the elevator, a wave of dizziness overwhelmed her.

She struggled to breathe, gasping for air, but it didn't help.

As the elevator ascended, Victoria felt lightheaded and lost control, falling forward and hitting her head against the elevator door with a loud thud.

***

The ongoing project meeting was interrupted by a sudden, urgent phone ring.

"Hello, this is the hospital. Are you Victoria Carter's family?"

William, who had been focused on the meeting with a stern expression, stood up abruptly and walked quickly towards the door, "I am."

He gestured for his assistant, Carl Ward, to take over the meeting.

After listening to the caller, William's deep eyes narrowed, and he spoke urgently, "I'll be there right away."

Soon, William appeared outside the hospital room.

"She's just overworked and not used to the environment here. It's nothing serious. She just needs to rest and recover."

Hearing the doctor's words, William finally breathed a sigh of relief.

He walked quietly into the room and looked at Victoria lying on the bed. Her face was as pale as paper, and her breathing was light and weak.

She was curled up under the white blanket, looking especially small and fragile.

William's face darkened inexplicably. He stood by the bed for a moment, then pulled up a chair and sat down slowly.

She had only been here for a short time and had already ended up in the hospital. She really didn't know how to take care of herself.

Victoria slept deeply and for a long time, dreaming of many chaotic things.

She dreamed of her family going on a rare outing together, filled with laughter and warmth;

She dreamed of her friend Wendy, reuniting after a long time, and Victoria excitedly asked her about her life over the years.

Finally, she dreamed of William.

In the dream, he was like a cold, distant iceberg, exuding an aura that kept people at bay. Just standing there and staring at her from afar made her feel a chill and break out in a cold sweat.

"No, don't look at me like that. I... I'm not afraid," she murmured in her sleep.

Victoria woke up suddenly, sitting up in a panic.

When she took in her surroundings, Victoria realized she was in a hospital room.

She raised her hand to rub her head, wincing as a sharp pain shot through her forehead.

"Careful, you've got a bump there."

The deep voice startled Victoria. She turned to see William sitting nearby.

"What are you doing here?"

"The hospital called, asking if I was your family."

Victoria felt her face flush with embarrassment. "Sorry, they didn't know the situation."

"What I'm curious about is how the hospital got my number and why they were so sure I was your relative."

Victoria's face grew even hotter, and she mumbled, "I just changed your contact name."

"Really?"

He seemed intrigued, asking slowly, "What did you change it to? Dad? Brother?"

"Of course not!" She cleared her throat, her voice barely audible, "Honey."

As soon as she said it, she wished she could disappear.

William was clearly taken aback, then looked at her in disbelief, staring intently, "What did you save it as?"

Victoria was so embarrassed she wanted to flee, regretting her words.

"You heard me." Her voice was still as soft as a whisper.

William suddenly smiled, then slowly walked over to her, his usual intense gaze roaming over her, "Honey?"

Victoria felt her face was hot enough to fry an egg.

"Don't you remember?" Victoria bit her lip, looking down to avoid his gaze, "You made me change it after that time."

William paused, then remembered he had indeed forced Victoria to change his contact name.

He smirked, his smile devilishly charming.

All these years, she hadn't deleted him or changed it back.

He narrowed his eyes, a playful look in them, nodding slightly, "So, since I made you do it, why didn't you change 'Honey' back? Couldn't bear to?"

Victoria knew he was doing this on purpose!

He repeated "Honey" over and over, clearly trying to embarrass her to the extreme!

Finally, Victoria decided to just go for it.

She said, "I just wanted to get through these years peacefully, without being bothered by boring people. So, whenever someone asked for my number or wouldn't leave me alone, I'd show them that contact name."

She continued, "The reason I saved your number is because it looked like an unused number, and changing the contact name didn't feel weird. I didn't plan on contacting you anyway."

William listened, his expression unreadable.

"I see. So, for you, that contact name was just a way to avoid harassment?"

Victoria thought for a moment, then replied nonchalantly, "If you want to see it that way, sure."

William's gaze on her grew colder. "Never contact again, what do you mean?"

"Exactly what it sounds like."

At this point, she had nothing to hide. "You're here now, and you probably won't go back to Silvermist City. I have my own life, and I'm quite happy with it. I don't plan on leaving. We're probably completely done now. I'm satisfied with my current state, so why would I call you?"

William didn't speak, just stared at her without blinking.

Victoria avoided his gaze, "I'm just stating the facts."

William was silent for a long time before nodding slowly, "You're right."

His attitude was much colder than before, his eyes distant, "How could I forget, you always kept your life and feelings separate. To you, I might just be a memory."

###chapter 239 An Offer

"It's history," Victoria corrected quickly.

William took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm inside him.

He soon smiled again. "Alright then, let's settle the score."

Victoria eyed him warily. "Settle what score? I already repaid you for your help."

She clearly remembered the days she helped him with his projects. Was he just part of her past now?

William's eyes darkened.

"I've always said my time is valuable, charged by the second. I wasn't exaggerating, was I?"

"No."

"I interrupted an important meeting and rushed here. How do you plan to make up for my loss?"

"Name your price." Victoria thought this was fair enough.

William narrowed his eyes and chuckled softly. "The projects you worked on must have been pretty profitable, right? You must have made a lot of money."

He was right. With Alvin's industry connections, Victoria's annual income was quite substantial. Despite her modest spending habits, she was actually quite wealthy.

"But I'm not looking for financial compensation." William got straight to the point. "Infinity Unity Group needs a display designer."

Victoria looked at him skeptically. "A company that big needs a designer?"

"Exactly. Because the company is large and has many projects, we need to expand the team," he replied without missing a beat. "Instead of wasting money hiring externally, why not have you join us?"

Victoria frowned. "I haven't graduated yet, no degree."

"I don't mind."

"I lack experience, can't handle it."

"You helped Marcella shine at the exchange event. Don't be modest. Our company needs talent like you. To become a top display designer, you need the platform I can provide."

Victoria's mind was in turmoil. William was still the same; he knew how to control her, knew what she wanted and cared about!

Victoria indeed aspired to be an outstanding display designer. Her years at Starry Studio Gallery had fueled her passion for display design. Compared to Dreamscape Construction, Infinity Unity Group, a Fortune 500 company, undoubtedly offered more opportunities to showcase her talents.

But she looked at William and after a moment said, "I don't want to mix business with personal matters."

"Funny, neither do I." William lazily lowered his eyes. "I've always said I'm a businessman, I don't do unprofitable deals. In business, having you work for my company is the best use of resources, maximizing benefits. But I don't know what you are expecting?"

"Who's expecting anything?" Victoria didn't expect that after years apart, William had learned to turn the tables on her!

Ignoring her reaction, William continued, "You don't need to worry. To me, you're just someone who can save me money. Plus, you don't belong to any faction, your background is clean, I can use you with peace of mind."

Victoria glared at him. "What if I don't agree?"

"You will," William said confidently. "You love your work too much to pass up this opportunity. After all, none of the companies you currently have access to can compare to Infinity Unity Group."

Victoria looked away. Damn it, he was right.

"I need to think about it." She was still cautious.

"Don't keep me waiting too long, I don't have much patience."

Just then, a nurse came in to notify Victoria it was time for a check-up.

William stood up and walked over to her, extending a hand.

Victoria stared at it for a moment, then turned away, pretending not to see it. She stood up and said, "I can manage on my own, no need to trouble you."

After all, he was too "expensive" for her to afford!

William smirked. "Who else should you trouble if not your 'honey'?"

Victoria's face turned red uncontrollably. "I've already explained everything."

He didn't say anything, but grabbed her wrist. "The doctor said you're too weak. If no one's around, who knows what might happen?"

She was puzzled. "Did the doctor really say that?"

"Want me to bring him over so you can ask yourself?"

"No need." Victoria's heart raced and her breathing became uneven as they stood close together. 

She silently cursed herself for being so weak. Just a moment ago, she was so confident, but now, just because he got close, she was flustered.

William, on the other hand, showed no emotion on his face. His eyes remained deep and dark. But the moment he touched her, it felt like something lightly pricked his heart, a bit numb, with a faint, almost imperceptible pain.

This feeling was intoxicating. He didn't want to let go of her wrist, his fingers unconsciously tightening slightly, wanting to hold on tighter.

She let out a low cry.

William raised an eyebrow. "Did I hurt you?"

He loosened his grip and glanced at her wrist, noticing a faint scar. His brows furrowed even more.

Victoria had no idea what he was thinking. She just felt uncomfortable. Finally, they reached the hallway outside the room, and she looked up to see a very familiar face.

Alice seemed to have rushed over from somewhere, standing anxiously at the door. The first thing she saw was the two of them walking closely together.

Victoria hadn't expected to see Alice here. But thinking about Alice's obsession with William, it wasn't surprising she followed him here, especially with Victoria around. Her alarm bells must be ringing.

Honestly, Victoria never liked Alice. Remembering the things Alice had done, Victoria used to avoid her as much as possible. She couldn't afford to provoke her, so she stayed away.

But things were different now.

Alice scrutinized Victoria carefully, only momentarily losing her composure before regaining her haughty demeanor, taking control of the situation.

"You disappeared in the middle of a meeting without a word? I was worried sick looking for you," she said to William, seemingly full of concern but actually filled with reproach, subtly hinting at her close relationship with him.

So what if the engagement was called off? For the past three years, she had been the one by his side.

William treated her naturally, not even bothering to explain Victoria's presence, simply responding, "Something came up."

She nodded slightly, not pressing further.

William escorted Victoria to her check-up. In front of Alice, Victoria didn't refuse.

When the nurse said she needed to remove her outerwear, Alice stepped forward. "You're a man, it's not appropriate. Let me help, you wait outside."

###chapter 240 Picking Her Up

William glanced at Victoria, but she wasn't even looking at him. He frowned, opened the door, and walked out.

Only then did Alice turn to Victoria, her eyes brazenly scanning her up and down. "So, you don't need any help, right?"

Victoria had been ignoring her the whole time, only turning her gaze back slowly when she heard Alice speak. She gave a faint smile. "Nope, I don't. So, Ms. Garcia, don't trouble yourself. Staying here will just make things awkward for both of us."

Alice casually pulled out her business card and handed it over. "Don't be in such a rush. Just wanted to remind you, Ms. Carter, if you need anything in the future, give me a call. William's got a lot on his plate; his time isn't just for one person."

Victoria felt a bit guilty about the whole situation. The call had come from the hospital, but it was because she had made a foolish note.

It wasn't just William or Alice who might overthink it; even she found it absurd and laughable.

So, faced with Alice's half-warning, half-insulting words, Victoria didn't argue back.

When Alice came out, William was on the phone not far away.

His phone was on silent, and calls had been coming in one after another. He was finally getting a chance to handle them.

After giving a few instructions, he hung up and turned around to see Alice.

"Why are you out here?" He frowned slightly.

Alice walked straight up to him, looking him directly in the eyes. "What are you worried about? She's perfectly fine but here trying to get your sympathy! I don't believe you can't see that!"

William lowered his eyes, his expression indifferent. "Then let her put on a good show."

"William! Victoria doesn't care about you! It's been three years. If she still had feelings for you, how could she not have called even once? When you truly love someone, even three months, three days, or three hours apart is torture!"

Alice seemed desperate to wake him up, clenching her fists, her eyes slightly red.

"You're played by a woman who doesn't care about you; you really disappoint me!" She shouted, then turned and walked away.

William remained expressionless, not even calling out to stop her or offering any explanation as he watched her leave.

Alice walked all the way to the hospital entrance.

She suddenly stopped, taking deep breaths, reminding herself not to act impulsively.

William didn't like others interfering with him, and he hated being controlled. The reason they had managed to get along for the past three years was largely because she knew her boundaries.

After thinking it over, she took out her phone. "Grandpa Scott, this is Alice..."

When Victoria came out of the examination room, she saw William sitting outside.

He seemed deep in thought, his brows furrowed, his gaze distant.

She was surprised, thinking he had already left.

Seeing her come out, he stood up. "Let's go."

Victoria followed behind him, looking up at his tall, upright figure.

She could clearly feel the long-buried emotions in her heart quietly resurfacing.

But now, facing these indescribable feelings again, she was no longer as flustered as before and could handle them calmly.

So, she suppressed these emotions and spoke calmly. "Thanks for today. But let's part ways here. I can take care of myself."

William abruptly stopped.

Victoria also stopped, her heart starting to tremble slightly.

He replied, "You're right. You've always been able to take care of yourself."

His words shook her again. She thought she would have to argue, but he agreed so readily.

It seemed she had been overthinking things.

William walked past her without another word.

Victoria stood there, slowly turning to watch him leave.

Victoria wasn't seriously ill and was discharged the next day after spending one night in the hospital.

As soon as she returned to the hotel, Marcella called her to her room.

Marcella pointed at her nose and started scolding her without giving her a chance to explain!

Victoria's strength hadn't fully returned, and with irregular meals over the past few days, she was extremely weak.

But Marcella, full of energy, showed no signs of tiring as she berated her.

Finally, Victoria couldn't take it anymore and interrupted Marcella. "Marcella, I think you misunderstand. I'm an employee of the gallery, not your personal assistant, and certainly not your servant to be ordered around."

Ignoring Marcella's furious expression, she slammed the door and left.

"Come back here! Do you hear me? Victoria, come back!"

The only response was the sound of the door slamming shut across the hall.

Marcella was livid. How dare a lowly employee who relied on her for survival talk back?

Especially since Victoria had always been so submissive, her sudden rebellion was a shock Marcella couldn't handle.

"Don't think that just because you made a splash at the exchange, you can stand on equal footing with me! Without me, you're nothing!" Marcella swept everything off the table in a fit of rage, her face contorted with anger.

But now she had a problem. She had driven Victoria away, so what about the dinner Delmar had arranged for tonight?

Delmar had specifically asked her to bring her "assistant."

Though Marcella was extremely annoyed that Victoria had caught Delmar's eye, she still had to bring her along.

But on the other hand, if Victoria didn't show up because she was angry, it would be her own fault for missing the opportunity, and she couldn't blame anyone else!

Even if Delmar asked, she had plenty of excuses!

Thinking this, Marcella smiled smugly.

Victoria rarely lost her temper like this. She knew Marcella's personality and wouldn't waste time on pointless arguments.

Maybe it was because she had run into someone she didn't want to see, and her mood was terrible, making she felt Marcella's usual arrogance unbearable this time.

Back in her room, Victoria fell asleep immediately, deciding that no matter what, she needed to rest first.

She slept as if she were cut off from the world.

She was woken by the ringing of her phone.

When she answered, a cheerful voice came through. "Victoria?"

Victoria frowned. "Alton?"

"What are you doing?"

"Sleeping." She couldn't help but yawn.

"That's no good! Such a beautiful day, you can't waste it sleeping! Get dressed up nicely, I'll come pick you up in a bit."

Victoria sat up, puzzled. "Why are you picking me up?"

"You're staying for a while, right? I'll show you around."

Before she could refuse, Alton hung up after saying, "See you in an hour."

Victoria sat there for a moment, then touched her stomach. She did need to go out and eat something.

An hour later, Alton arrived on time.

"You're wearing that?" He looked her up and down. She was wearing a simple white cotton dress, her hair tied in a casual ponytail, and no makeup.

Though she looked fresh and elegant, it was a bit too plain.

Victoria blinked, looking down at herself. "We're not going on a date. This is fine, isn't it?"

###chapter 241 A Gathering

Alton couldn't help but chuckle as he opened the car door with a playful flourish. "After you."

Once they were inside, he glanced at her and half-joked, "You trust me this much? Aren't you worried I might sell you off?"

Victoria shot back, "Would you?"

Feigning deep thought, he replied, "It's not that I wouldn't, it's that I don't dare."

With William around, he wouldn't dare no matter what!

Victoria asked, "So, where are you taking me?"

"Just a gathering of some industry bigwigs. It's pretty boring, but the food is great. Think of it as a chance to enjoy a good meal."

Victoria smiled, pleased with his answer.

But her satisfaction didn't last long. As soon as she followed Alton into the private room, she froze.

She hadn't expected to see Marcella and Delmar there!

Marcella's face darkened when she saw Victoria, while Delmar was momentarily taken aback before asking, "You're Victoria, right? Weren't you supposed to be busy?"

Victoria raised an eyebrow, her gaze sweeping over Marcella's guilty expression, instantly understanding the situation.

She gave Delmar a faint smile. "Plans changed."

"Glad you could make it!" Delmar seemed genuinely pleased, especially when he noticed Alton following behind her. His eyes lit up.

"Victoria, you know Mr. Bridges too?" he asked.

Marcella, now noticing Alton, recognized him as the man she had seen at the hotel a few days ago.

Alton led Victoria to a seat, smiling. "Victoria is a friend of mine."

"What a coincidence!" Delmar laughed heartily. First William, and now Alton. The more he looked at Victoria, the more he felt she brought good luck!

Marcella eyed Victoria warily, relieved when she saw no intention of exposing her. With a smile, she chided, "You should have called me when your plans changed. I could have sent someone to pick you up. You're new here, what if something happened?"

Victoria gave her a cold glance, too tired to deal with her hypocrisy.

"This place has some of the best security in the country. I had nothing to worry about." With that, she turned her attention away from Marcella.

Marcella kept smiling, but inside, she was seething.

Did Victoria think that just because Delmar favored her, she could rise above her station?

Not while Marcella was around!

However, Alton, sitting next to Victoria, caught her attention. She kept steering the conversation towards him, occasionally toasting him with a drink.

Alton, having navigated such social scenes for years, was no longer the naive young man he once was.

He had seen enough of human nature to understand people like Marcella.

But he maintained a gentle demeanor and a smile.

For him, it was all about interests now, not personal likes or dislikes.

So, he kept his emotions in check, responding to Marcella's enthusiasm like a seasoned player in love, neither rejecting her nor making her feel brushed off.

It was as if he gave her hope, yet not quite, making her feel that just a bit more effort would suffice.

Under this illusion, Marcella became even more eager to please him.

Victoria noticed all of this. When Alton poured her a drink, she whispered, "She's still my boss. Don't go too far."

Alton knew what she meant and smiled. "I'm not doing anything. It's all in her head."

Victoria rolled her eyes. "That's what makes it worse!"

He teased, "I didn't know you had become a little justice warrior!"

Their interaction, seen by Marcella, looked like they were whispering secrets.

She glared at Victoria, convinced she was deliberately opposing her.

Delmar, meanwhile, chatted with others, but his attention never strayed far from them.

At the same time, the scene of Victoria and Alton together was noticed by someone just entering the room.

William glanced at them briefly, showing no emotion, as if they didn't interest him at all.

Beside him was Alice, elegantly dressed in a red gown that accentuated her figure. Her captivating eyes could easily enchant anyone.

Together, she and William looked like a perfect couple.

Victoria hadn't expected them to be there. She immediately glared at Alton, who quickly raised his hands in mock innocence.

"Mr. Scott never shares his schedule with us. I just wanted to treat you to a good meal! Pure coincidence, I swear!"

Alton had clearly become more cunning over the years, and Victoria didn't believe him.

But since they were already there, and it wasn't her place, she decided not to show her displeasure.

Remembering their connection from the previous day, she smiled and greeted William. "Mr. Scott."

William responded with a simple nod, not even looking at her.

Victoria didn't mind. She had done her part in being polite; the rest was none of her concern.

Delmar immediately stood up to welcome them. "Mr. Scott, Ms. Garcia, welcome."

Alice's eyes flashed with disdain when she saw Victoria.

They were seated at the head of the table, directly opposite Victoria and Alton.

Alton leaned slightly towards Victoria, whispering, "You'll have to protect me later."

Victoria gave him a complex look.

Protect him?

Why should she?

Everyone here had a higher status than her.

She placed a delicate dish on his plate. "Eat more, talk less."

"You seem smart usually, but why act dumb at crucial moments?" He ate the dish she gave him.

Their familiar interaction didn't look like just friends.

Marcella noticed and teased, "Victoria, you and Mr. Bridges seem close. Did you two have a past romance? I'm so envious."

She scooted closer to Alton. "Mr. Bridges, do tell."

Her interest in Alton was obvious, and she shot a warning glance at Victoria, clearly staking her claim.

William, listening to Delmar, glanced over casually, his deep eyes growing darker.

Alice smiled, sipping her wine, her gaze towards Victoria filled with mockery.

To her, Victoria was only fit for someone like Alton, a fallen rich kid.

Victoria lowered her eyes. Before Alton could speak, she firmly said, "Marcella, you misunderstand. Alton and I are just friends. There's no story."

Alton, eager to avoid trouble, quickly nodded. "It's true! I admire Victoria's talent, nothing more!"

Marcella was pleased. "I see, my mistake for jumping to conclusions."

Alton stood up respectfully, raising his glass. "Mr. Scott, a toast to you."

William glanced at him lazily, taking his time before raising his glass.

Only then did Alton relax.

He didn't want any trouble!

Delmar joked, "When can we attend Mr. Scott and Ms. Garcia's wedding?"

Victoria paused mid-bite.

###chapter 242 Bright Future

From the moment Victoria saw William and Alice together, she knew deep down that their shared backgrounds and talents would eventually bring them together.

But then she heard William said, "I'm also eager to attend Alice's wedding."

That one question shattered all the rumors about them being a couple.

Delmar, sensing the awkwardness, quickly smiled to lighten the mood. "I get it, you two are just super focused on your careers!"

Alice bit her lip and looked up at William, her eyes filled with sadness.

She let out a soft, bitter laugh. "You want me to get married so badly? Who'd marry me now? Everyone knows my story. Who'd want me?"

She didn't say more, just picked up her drink and downed it in one go.

William stared at her, his jaw tight. When the waiter came over to pour more wine, he blocked the glass with his hand. "Get her some water."

"Yes, sir."

Alice, unusually stubborn, shot back, "What, I can't even drink now?"

William frowned and slowly moved his hand away.

"Pour the wine," Alice demanded.

"Yes, ma'am."

Across the table, Marcella was bombarding Alton with questions; Delmar was chatting animatedly with some friends. Victoria, quietly eating, tried to stay unnoticed but couldn't help watching the interaction between William and Alice.

Alice could usually handle her liquor, but she was in a bad mood today, so she got drunk quickly.

William, seeing this, took her glass away. "I'll take you home."

Alice leaned against him. "Why are you so good to me? But you can't marry me? Do you despise me too? Anyone can despise me, but not you. You can't! I became the 'bad woman' they talk about because of you."

"Stop talking," William's brows furrowed deeply.

Her words cut him deeply.

Seeing Alice drunk, Delmar and the others quickly escorted them to the door. "Mr. Scott, should I send someone to take you home?"

Alton hurried over as well. "Mr. Scott, let me handle it."

As a subordinate, he had to help his boss.

"No need." William still held Alice in his arms, not letting anyone else intervene.

Alice clung to him, her arms tightly around his neck, her face buried in his chest. "William, take me home."

He looked down at her. "Okay."

The tenderness in his voice was surprising coming from someone as decisive as William.

He didn't look back as they left.

Victoria kept her head down, eating the delicate pastries on her plate.

Delmar and the others started gossiping. "Did you see that? So affectionate. I don't believe there's nothing between them!"

"Yeah, they were engaged before, but then they broke it off for some reason."

"It's normal. They're both career-driven. It takes time to adjust."

Alton, while dealing with Marcella, glanced worriedly at Victoria.

"I need to use the restroom," Victoria suddenly said, standing up.

Alton offered to go with her. "I'll come with you."

"No need." She pushed the door open and left.

Victoria stood in the hallway, took a deep breath, and suppressed her irritation before heading to the restroom.

As she approached, she heard William's concerned voice by the sink. "Feeling any better?"

"No, I still feel awful."

Victoria's steps halted abruptly. She turned around, leaning against the hallway wall, staring at the floor.

"If you can't handle alcohol, why drink so much? You're only hurting yourself. What were you thinking?" William's scolding was full of concern.

"Why did I drink? You don't know why?" Alice's voice was full of grievance. "People asked me such questions in public, and you just flatly denied it. Did you consider my dignity?"

"It won't happen again." William seemed particularly accommodating to her.

Victoria listened quietly. The two of them had a genuine past together.

Although they had broken off their engagement, their lingering connection spoke volumes.

"I feel so awful," Alice said, leaning against William. "Take me home."

"Okay." William put an arm around her waist and helped her up. "I'll have the maid make you some hangover soup."

"Got it."

Victoria waited until they left before slowly coming out.

Looking at the empty hallway ahead, she lowered her gaze, a faint, bitter smile forming on her lips.

This was for the best.

It really was.

***

Alton offered to take Victoria back to the hotel. Marcella immediately stood up. "Perfect, it's on the way. Mr. Bridges, would you mind giving me a ride too?"

"Not at all," Alton replied.

Victoria admired Alton's patience and composure with women.

Before parting, Delmar pulled Victoria aside for a private word.

"Victoria, you have a bright future ahead."

"Delmar, you're too kind."

"Have you considered developing your career here? With your talent, it won't be long before you make a name for yourself."

Victoria was taken aback. Delmar didn't press for an answer, just smiled and told her to think it over.

In the parking lot, Marcella quickly took the front seat. Victoria glanced at her but said nothing, sitting in the back.

She was past the age of caring about such trivial matters.

Throughout the ride, Marcella chatted with Alton, their laughter filling the car.

Victoria leaned back, gazing out the window, lost in thought.

Alton glanced in the rearview mirror and smiled. "I'm off tomorrow. Want to go somewhere?"

It was clear he was asking Victoria.

"Sure!" Marcella quickly responded, excited. "I've been wanting to visit some famous spots in the city!"

Alton smiled but said nothing more.

Soon, the car stopped at the hotel entrance.

Marcella received a call just as Victoria was about to get out. Alton called after her.

"If Mr. Scott and she were meant to be, it would have happened by now. It wouldn't have dragged on this long."

Victoria smiled. "Thanks for tonight, Alton."

Back at the hotel, Marcella blocked her path.

Though her expression was still unpleasant, her attitude had softened. "Are you going tomorrow?"

"No."

Marcella frowned. She could tell Victoria wasn't interested in Alton, so she no longer saw her as a rival.

She got straight to the point. "I like him."

Victoria looked up. "Congratulations."

"Don't be sarcastic. Will you help me or not?"

"Marcella, you like him, not me. How can I help?"

"Victoria, don't play dumb," Marcella said bluntly. "Help me create opportunities, and I'll get you promoted."

Victoria's face darkened. "I don't need to trade favors for a promotion."

Marcella frowned. She disliked Victoria not just because she was Hannah's rival, but also because of her annoying pride!

Marcella glared at her. Victoria was truly unyielding. Finally, Marcella said, "Fine, you're amazing. But as the general manager, I'm asking you to help. Is that enough?"

It wasn't easy for Marcella to ask for help.

And Victoria had never seen her so invested in anyone.

After thinking it over, she said, "I'll go tomorrow, just to relax."

Marcella smiled. "Got it."

For the first time, she found Victoria not so annoying.

###chapter 243 Alluring

Alton showed up early, and Marcella was dressed to impress.

She wore a light pink floral dress, paired with a delicate lace hat and a matching small handbag, giving off a sweet and charming vibe.

In contrast, Victoria was much more casual, even a bit disheveled.

From the moment Marcella saw her, she looked at her with disdain. Taking advantage of Alton going to buy drinks, she couldn't help but ask, "I heard from Hannah that your family isn't well-off, but not this bad, right?"

Victoria was speechless.

How rude could she be?

She didn't respond, and Marcella took her silence as agreement.

"No matter how broke you are, you should have a few decent clothes! It's one thing to dress like an average person at work, but when you're out to meet a guy, you should at least make an effort."

"I'm fine like this."

Marcella rolled her eyes, "You're hopeless!"

When Alton returned, Marcella immediately became sweet and well-behaved.

They finally arrived at their destination.

The city's largest outdoor recreational campsite.

Alton chose a relatively secluded spot, with plenty of space between the tents to ensure privacy.

Two tents, one for the guys and one for the girls.

Then, Alton got busy preparing a feast.

Marcella went to help, and when she saw Victoria approaching, she kept giving her looks, "Didn't you stay up late last night? Go rest in the tent for a bit."

Victoria raised an eyebrow, perfectly happy with the suggestion.

So, she happily crawled into a tent and fell asleep.

She didn't know how long she slept, but Marcella came in once to wake her, "Time to eat."

Victoria, who hadn't slept well the night before, was in a deep sleep and waved her off, "Not hungry."

"Really?"

Marcella's voice had a hint of glee.

When Victoria woke up again, it was to the sound of laughter outside.

She realized it was already dark outside, with bonfires blazing and people having a great time all around.

Victoria crawled out of the tent and stretched lazily.

Before she could fully wake up, a large coat was draped over her shoulders.

She froze, maintaining her stretching pose, staring blankly at the person in front of her.

William?

What was he doing here?

William, holding a skewer of grilled meat, glanced at her, "Do you even know where you are? Wearing so little to sleep."

Victoria belatedly looked down and realized her loose short-sleeve shirt had slipped off one shoulder, revealing a bit of smooth skin.

It was somewhat alluring.

She instinctively pulled the coat tighter around her.

"Eat something." William placed the grilled food on a plate and handed it to her.

Victoria hesitated for only a second before taking it and sitting down to eat quietly.

William stood beside her, his tall and handsome figure drawing attention, along with his strikingly good looks. Many girls came over to chat him up.

With the night, the alcohol, and the lively atmosphere, everyone was letting loose, mingling freely with strangers and friends alike.

But someone as outstanding as William drew even more attention, and soon someone asked for his contact information.

William, who was usually impatient, initially responded perfunctorily, but eventually, he simply stepped aside to reveal Victoria, "Sorry, my girlfriend is here."

Victoria stiffened slightly, the term "girlfriend" making her ears burn.

But she understood he was just using her as a shield, so she didn't overthink it.

The girl got the hint and left with a smile.

But it wasn't long before another girl, wearing a crop top and shorts, sauntered over, leaning in close and calling out sweetly, "Hey there..."

This time, William was more direct, pointing at Victoria, "My wife."

The girl awkwardly touched her nose and walked away.

Hearing him call her "wife" so smoothly, Victoria frowned and sincerely suggested, "You know, wearing a mask might help."

William glanced at her, taking in her reluctance.

He narrowed his eyes and smirked, "With you here, why should I inconvenience myself?"

Victoria looked up at him, "You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?"

"Doing what on purpose?"

"Making me uncomfortable."

William chuckled, "Saying you're my wife makes you uncomfortable?"

"No! I mean... never mind." She decided it wasn't worth explaining further.

Keeping things simple between them was best.

Amid the surrounding noise and excitement, it felt like an invisible barrier separated the two of them.

After finishing her food, she asked, "Why are you here?"

He looked at her with mild confusion, "Didn't you see the sign when you entered this area?"

Victoria shook her head, bewildered.

"How do you expect to be a designer with no observational skills?" he retorted.

Victoria didn't appreciate that comment. She focused intensely at work, but during her time off, she didn't want to force herself.

"This land belongs to the Scott family, and so does this campsite. I come here once a month, and it just so happens to be today, coincidentally running into you." William emphasized the point.

Victoria mentally rolled her eyes. As if he was afraid she'd think he came just for her.

But with that explanation, she felt more at ease.

"Is there more food?" She had slept all day, and the few bites she had weren't enough.

William's deep, attractive eyes lingered on her, a slight smile playing on his lips, "Wait here."

Victoria obediently sat in her chair, smiling as she watched the people enjoying themselves.

"So, have you thought about what I mentioned?" He returned, handing her more food.

"About working at your company?" Victoria asked.

"Technically, it's not my company, it's my aunt's."

Daisy?

William continued, "Aunt Daisy handles all the major and minor affairs of the company. I'm just trying to find some trustworthy people to help her out." He paused, then added, "You know about the issues between me and Uncle Wayne..."

Victoria understood immediately and said, "How's she doing now? I would like to help if she truly needs me. "

Now it was William's turn to be surprised. He scrutinized her, "Last time I mentioned it, you seemed reluctant. But as soon as I mentioned Aunt Daisy, you show so much concern. She must hold a special place in your heart."

There was a hint of jealousy in his tone.

But Victoria didn't think much of it. She was only concerned about Daisy's situation, and William patiently explained a bit more.

The firelight cast a warm glow on her face, making her look both charming and cozy. William watched her for a moment before looking away.

He said, "You and Alton seem to get along well. Actually, you two hit it off years ago. And if I remember correctly, you even got hurt because of him."

Victoria rolled her eyes at him, "That was ages ago. We're just friends."

"And now?" He didn't seem ready to drop the subject, staring at her intently, "What if he confessed his feelings to you now?"

Victoria frowned, about to speak, but then her expression softened. "Now? He wouldn't be that foolish."

Seeing her gaze fixed in a certain direction, smiling, William followed her line of sight.

He was stunned.

Alton and Marcella were hidden behind a nearby tree, locked in a passionate embrace, kissing deeply. 

###chapter 244 A Man and a Woman Alone

She had never noticed before, but now she was surprisingly bold, and she seemed quite skilled at it.

Just then, a large hand blocked her view.

Startled, she instinctively tried to push it away.

Instead, she got a light tap on the forehead. 

"You think you can just watch anything?" William teased.

Victoria pushed his hand away, rubbing her head. "What's the big deal? We're not kids anymore. Besides, if they dare to kiss, why can't I watch?"

William looked at her like she was a stranger, his eyes widening. "What happened to you these past few years? You used to blush just talking about this stuff!"

Victoria sneered, "Isn't that thanks to you?"

As soon as the words left her mouth, her smile froze, and she looked away in frustration. "I didn't mean it like that."

William was also taken aback for a moment, then he narrowed his deep eyes and gave a faint smile. "So, you're still a good girl."

Victoria's face turned red instantly.

She quickly stuffed a few pieces of food into her mouth and stood up to head into the tent. "I'm tired. I need more sleep."

Suddenly, her wrist was grabbed.

She turned back, puzzled, looking at William.

"Eat so much and you're not afraid of indigestion? Get up and walk around."

"I didn't eat that much! And I don't need exercise."

Her protest was completely ignored.

William's grip was strong, and as he pulled her along, Victoria almost stumbled.

She quickly shook off his hand. "I can walk by myself."

William shoved his hands into his pockets, looking at the lively scene around them. "What do you think of this place? Any suggestions?"

"No complaints, it's great."

Seeing her perfunctory attitude, William just raised an eyebrow slightly and said nothing more.

The two of them walked around the camp, and as the crowd gradually dispersed, only two bonfires continued to burn brightly.

Victoria didn't want to be alone with him and was about to head back when she received a message from Marcella.

[Don't come back so soon!!!]

Staring at those three exclamation marks, Victoria understood perfectly well what was going on.

Are those two moving too fast?

As she sat by the fire in a daze, William spoke leisurely beside her. "Now you know why I asked you to come out for a walk?"

Victoria looked at him in surprise. "You figured it out already?"

He scoffed. "A guy and a girl alone together, what else could it be?"

Victoria's heart skipped a beat, and she blurted out, "Is that how it was back then with you too?"

She regretted it as soon as she said it.

Damn, what's wrong with her tonight?

"I was just asking casually, no other meaning. Just pretend I didn't ask," she quickly added.

But William looked at her deeply, the flickering firelight in his eyes seemed to be saying something.

"To you, I..."

Her heart tightened. She didn't want to know the answer, but she couldn't help feeling nervous.

Just then, a series of loud bangs erupted, and the sky lit up with a dazzling display of fireworks.

It was the camp's regular fireworks show.

Victoria watched William's mouth move, but the answer she deliberately ignored was lost in the brilliant fireworks.

When the fireworks ended, Victoria slowly looked away.

William was on the phone.

She overheard him asking, "How are you feeling now? I'm at the camp. Yes, I'll be back soon."

Victoria suddenly lost interest. Whatever he was about to say no longer mattered.

She didn't want to delve into it. Keeping things as they were was just fine.

William turned and saw her, hesitated for a moment, but Victoria spoke first. "Leaving? Go ahead."

She got up and walked back, hoping she wouldn't run into an awkward scene when she returned. Their alone time had lasted long enough.

Suddenly, William grabbed her wrist.

She looked up, her expression calm as water.

William frowned, staring at her intently. "Can you stay?"

"Of course not." She smiled lightly, gently pushing his hand away. "One night here is enough. Beautiful experiences should be left with a sense of longing, so you'll look forward to coming back next time."

William wanted to say something, but his phone rang again.

The frown on his face deepened.

He finally answered, "Okay, I'm leaving now."

Victoria gave him a brief glance and turned to leave.

By the time William hung up and turned back, she was already far away.

When Victoria got back to the tent, she deliberately cleared her throat.

Soon, Marcella, cheeks flushed, emerged from Alton's tent. "You're back. Get some rest."

She ducked into another tent.

A moment later, Alton came out too.

Victoria looked at him with a hint of disdain.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" Alton felt wronged. "Weren't you the one who set us up?"

"Are you serious about this?"

"What does serious mean? Marriage?" Alton laughed and waved his hand. "Even if I proposed now, she wouldn't say yes. So why think so far ahead? Just enjoy the moment."

Victoria's views were a bit traditional. To her, any relationship not aimed at marriage was irresponsible.

Alton changed the subject. "What about you and Mr. Scott?"

Victoria immediately crossed her arms, signaling him to stop.

"Don't ask. It won't change anything."

"Alright." Alton lit a cigarette, looking content and relaxed, making Victoria roll her eyes. 

"Marcella is my boss. Don't mess around. If you really don't want to continue, at least talk to her properly. Don't just disappear! Otherwise, even if she doesn't come looking for you, I will!"

Alton was amused by her words. "Alright, alright. For your sake, I won't be an irresponsible jerk."

Victoria said no more and turned back to her tent.

Marcella seemed to be asleep already. Victoria quietly took off her jacket and slipped into her sleeping bag.

Suddenly, a voice came from beside her. "Thanks for earlier."

Victoria was startled.

She heard that?

After speaking, Marcella seemed a bit embarrassed, adjusting her position and pretending to fall asleep quickly. 

After returning from the camp, Marcella and Alton were completely smitten with each other.

The two were inseparable, making Victoria feel like a third wheel.

She had come to Harborview City on paid leave, with flexible vacation rules.

Originally, she planned to relax, but seeing the situation, she decided it was better to head back soon.

"No way!"

The first to object was Marcella.

She had just gotten together with Alton and didn't want to return to Silvermist City so soon.

"I mean, you stay here, and I'll go back alone." Victoria patiently explained.

"That's even worse!" Marcella sat down next to her, linking her arm with Victoria's, acting like a close friend, which made Victoria a bit uncomfortable.

###chapter 245 Turning Enemies into Friends

Victoria gently pulled her arm away. "I liked it better the way it was before. The way you are now, it kind of freaks me out."

"Oh, come on," Marcella teased, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "I used to think you were such a pain, but now that I know you better, you're not so bad."

"Gee, thanks." Victoria didn't think that was much of a compliment.

It was probably because she'd been helping Marcella in her pursuit of Alton.

Marcella's playful expression faded as she spoke more seriously. "Actually, I've been thinking about something..."

Victoria was surprised by what she heard next. "You want to stay here?"

Marcella shrugged. "I was never really into the gallery. Staring at paintings and sculptures all day gives me a headache. I told my dad to transfer me to the branch here."

Victoria knew Alton was popular with the ladies, but she hadn't realized he had this much charm.

Even though Marcella was just an illegitimate child with little inheritance rights, Alton had managed to captivate her so quickly. He must have some serious skills.

It seemed like he had gone through a lot during the years his family had fallen on hard times.

"Well, if you want to stay, that's your decision."

"Of course not!" Marcella linked her arm with Victoria's again. "We're a dream team! I can't do this without you! You're so upright, I can't just leave you behind!"

Victoria didn't believe a word of her grandiose speech.

"What's with that look?" Marcella avoided Victoria's gaze, feeling a bit guilty. "Okay, okay, I admit it. You did help me out a little."

Victoria raised an eyebrow. Just a little?

"Fine, fine! I owe my success to you, happy now?" Marcella said.

Victoria looked away. To be honest, it was true.

Getting Marcella's approval wasn't easy.

"So, Victoria, will you stay here with me?" Marcella batted her eyes in a rare display of cuteness, which only gave Victoria goosebumps. "I heard Mr. Scott wants you to work at Infinity Unity Group. I'll get the gallery to let you go and give you a hefty severance package. How about that?"

"Can you just talk normally, Marcella?"

"I don't care. You have to agree! Otherwise, I'll keep talking like this!"

Victoria frowned, feeling like she didn't know her anymore. But the offer of several times her severance pay from Starry Studio Gallery was tempting.

"Honestly, I preferred the old you. This sudden friendliness is a bit unsettling."

"Oh, come on! I've always been this sweet and simple! I just listened to Hannah before and thought you were scheming. Naturally, I was cautious around you. But now, I genuinely consider you a friend!"

Victoria didn't know how to respond to her sudden sincerity.

Marcella then spent the entire afternoon listing the benefits of staying in Harborview City, pestering her until Victoria finally agreed to discuss it with her family.

As soon as she left Victoria's room, Marcella called Alton.

"I did what you said and appealed to her emotions. She said she'd think about it!"

Alton chuckled softly on the other end. "I knew you could do it, babe!"

"Of course." She smiled as she returned to her room, clutching her phone.

Just then, the door of Victoria's room slowly opened.

Victoria lowered her eyes, a slight smile playing on her lips.

No wonder Marcella was so eager to convince her to stay in Harborview City.

Victoria closed the door and immediately booked a flight.

She'd been in Harborview City long enough.

As for William's offer to join Infinity Unity Group, it was tempting, but she preferred to move at her own pace.

Besides, she still had an instinctive desire to keep her distance from William.

Her flight was in the evening, and as she packed, she received a call from Daisy.

"Victoria?"

Daisy wanted to meet, and since there was still time, they arranged to meet at a café near the hotel.

Victoria spotted Daisy as soon as she walked in. Daisy looked fantastic, exuding both youthful energy and mature charm, the kind that could captivate people of all ages.

"You came to Harborview City and didn't even visit me. That's not very nice!" As soon as they sat down, Daisy took the initiative.

"My bad, really, Daisy. I know I was wrong!"

Victoria was always sincere when admitting her mistakes to Daisy.

Daisy couldn't help but laugh, not really holding it against her.

"Let's cut to the chase," Daisy said directly. "I'm here to ask for your help. William should have mentioned that I'm in a bit of trouble."

Victoria was taken aback. She had thought William was just making excuses.

It turned out Daisy's situation was much more serious.

"That's the situation. My dad's been a bit muddled lately, making poor decisions, and it's put me in a tough spot at the company. I'm not looking to fight for anything, but if Wayne's involved, there's no room for compromise!"

"But what can I do? I don't know anything about this," Victoria asked.

Daisy raised a hand to stop her, frowning. "When did you become so hesitant? Where's the girl who braved Xandria with William?"

Victoria sighed. "Is it possible you guys have too much faith in me?"

"Don't flatter yourself. Did I say I valued your skills?" Daisy said.

Victoria fell silent. That was harsh.

"We need to build our own team within the company, but there aren't many trustworthy people around."

Victoria blinked. Was that the reason?

Daisy leaned forward, her gaze intense. "I'll ask you straight. I'm in trouble. Will you help me or not?"

Could Victoria say no?

She realized she had no resistance against Daisy.

The father-daughter duo was really going to lose to Daisy!

As they left the café, Daisy patted her shoulder approvingly. "Do well. I have high hopes for you."

Victoria smiled wryly. "Thanks for the vote of confidence, Daisy."

After dropping Victoria off at the hotel, Daisy waved. "I'll pick you up tomorrow."

Before Victoria could respond, Daisy had already driven off.

As soon as she hit the road, Daisy's phone rang.

She glanced at the caller ID, pursed her lips, and looked away, planning to ignore it.

The call ended after a while.

Soon after, it rang again.

Daisy's expression turned amused, but she still didn't answer.

The call ended again.

Finally, it was quiet.

But just as she pulled into the garage, her phone rang again.

This time, she answered it leisurely. "I'm starting to think you put a tracker on me."

The man's voice on the other end sounded slightly annoyed. "Why didn't you answer sooner?"

"I did it on purpose," she replied.

She could hear the deep breath on the other end before he slowly asked, "Did she agree?"

"I knew you'd be anxious about her. Don't worry. With me on the case, what can't be done? She'll start next week."

###chapter 246 Renting a House

Hearing this, William felt a pang of discomfort. "I've talked with her about it so many times, but she never gives me a straight answer."

"Guess that means I'm more important to Victoria than you are!" Daisy teased.

William forced a smile, unable to argue.

"I'm taking her to see some apartments tomorrow. She can't keep staying at a hotel, right?" Daisy said.

After a moment of silence, William said slowly, "I remember you have an important appointment tomorrow."

Daisy laughed, "Oh, right! But what should I do? I've already promised Victoria. I can't just break my promise, can I? This is Harborview City, and Victoria doesn't know anyone here. If something happens, how would I explain it to her family?"

"Yeah, it's a tough situation," William remarked.

"I remember you seem to be free tomorrow."

"Not necessarily, I need to check with my assistant."

Daisy rolled her eyes, "Oh, come on! If you want to keep Victoria here, show some sincerity! I'll help you this time, but next time, you're on your own!"

When Victoria returned to the hotel, she saw Marcella standing in the lobby with her hands on her hips, completely disregarding her image. She marched up and demanded, "Are you leaving? Did you book a flight?"

Victoria looked at her in surprise. "How did you know?"

"Never mind how I know. Are you planning to abandon me?"

Her outburst drew curious glances from the people around them.

Especially with her indignant expression, it was hard not to speculate about their relationship.

Victoria helplessly pulled her into the elevator. "It's a misunderstanding. I'm not planning to leave. In fact, I've decided to stay."

"Really? You're not lying to me?"

Marcella immediately switched to a smile and affectionately linked arms with her. "That's more like it! Good friends should stick together!"

Victoria looked at her with amusement. "So, can you report back to Alton now?"

Marcella paused for a moment but then said nonchalantly, "I'm not just doing this for him. Staying here is good for our careers. Why not take the opportunity?"

"Then, can you tell me what opportunity Alton gave you? Or should I ask, what special arrangements did he make for you?"

Marcella pretended not to understand. "I'm so hungry! How about I treat you to dinner? Let's go for Mexican food!"

Victoria didn't bother arguing further and let Marcella drag her out of the hotel.

"Victoria, if you make a name for yourself here, you have to thank me! Without me, you wouldn't have this opportunity."

"Yes, yes, Marcella, you're my lucky charm!"

"I love your quick wit. Out of everyone in the gallery, I have the highest hopes for you."

"Alright, that's enough," Victoria said helplessly.

"Got it!"

***

"I have something urgent to attend to. I've sent someone to pick you up."

"Okay, Ms. Scott." Victoria answered the call as she walked out of the elevator.

When she reached the entrance, a black BMW honked. She turned around, thinking it must be the person Daisy mentioned.

She walked over, opened the door, and got in. "Hi, I'm..."

Seeing William in the driver's seat, she froze, then quickly realized what was going on.

"Did Ms. Scott send you?"

William glanced at her in the rearview mirror and replied slowly, "Yeah."

Victoria felt a bit helpless.

Daisy's matchmaking intentions were way too obvious!

She didn't mind, but what would William think?

Rejecting his invitation on one hand and letting Daisy play matchmaker on the other?

Victoria quickly explained, "I didn't know she would send you."

William drove steadily, lying without a hint of guilt, "She told me last minute. Said she wouldn't trust anyone else to pick you up."

Victoria believed him. That did sound like Daisy.

The atmosphere in the car was awkward.

Victoria broke the silence first. "If you have something to do, just give me the address. I can go by myself."

William's eyes met hers in the rearview mirror, his deep gaze seemingly calm. "Since she asked me to come, do you think she'd let me have anything else to do?"

With that, what else could she say?

Soon, the car stopped.

Victoria looked up at the upscale apartment complex. She knew Harborview City had expensive real estate, and the rent here wouldn't be cheap.

"Let's go." William got out of the car and looked back, seeing her still sitting there with a frown. He raised an eyebrow.

Victoria thought for a moment and said, "I can't afford the rent here."

"You're Aunt Daisy's favored subordinate. She'll cover everything."

"That's not right! I can't take advantage of Ms. Scott like that!"

William suddenly leaned down, one hand on the car door, looking at her with lowered eyes. "I notice you're kind to everyone else."

Victoria didn't like that. "Are you saying I'm not kind to you?"

He responded with a light snort.

He tapped the car roof lazily. "Not just you. The company always treats external hires well. During the contract period, they'll cover half the rent, plus transportation and communication allowances."

Hearing this, Victoria finally got out of the car.

They walked into the complex, one after the other. The environment was excellent, not overly luxurious but very quiet.

Seeing the apartment, Victoria was extremely satisfied. It was exactly her ideal solo living space!

The apartment was on the ground floor, with a minimalist design and mostly wooden furniture. There was a small garden in front, with clusters of blooming irises.

In the corner was a white swing, next to a delicate wooden gazebo with an unfinished chess game on the table.

William leaned against the door, watching her explore like a curious little fairy in a dream garden.

He couldn't help but smile. How long had it been since he'd seen such a relaxed and joyful expression on her face?

"This place is beautiful!" She stood among the blue and purple irises, smiling at him with eyes full of joy.

He spoke slowly, "Do you like it?"

"I love it!"

She really did!

Daisy knew her tastes so well!

Even if she had to pay the full rent, it would be worth it!

William said immediately, "I'll help you get your luggage from the hotel."

"No need to trouble yourself. I can manage."

Her eagerness to push him away made William's face darken. "I've already said, if you don't want to, I won't force you. Do you really need to be so defensive?"
