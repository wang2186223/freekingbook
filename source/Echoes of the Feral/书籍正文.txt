###chapter One: Wolves Don’t Belong in Silverwood
********
Riley discovers she's not human, but an ancient power awakening within her. Torn between a wolf who saved her life and one offering dark truths, she must embrace her true nature before it consumes her—or the pack hunts her down. 
*********

Silverwood smelled like rain and secrets.

Riley Hayes had lived in this town her whole life, long enough to know its stories the whispers of creatures in the woods, of missing hikers and glowing eyes in the dark. Long enough to know better than to believe any of it.

The legends were Silverwood's favorite bedtime stories, repeated over bonfires and hushed in the hallways of Silverwood High. But Riley had never been the type to believe in fairy tales.

Until tonight.

The storm was rolling in fast, thick clouds swallowing the sky and casting the woods in shadows. The damp air carried the scent of pine and something else, something electric like the moment before lightning struck. Riley tugged the hood of her jacket higher over her head and picked up her pace.

She should never have taken the shortcut through the woods.

But Nova had bailed on their study session at the last minute (probably to make out with Jake Carter behind the gym, not that Riley could judge), and she hadn't wanted to wait another forty-five minutes for her mom to pick her up from the library. Walking through the woods shaved ten minutes off her route home.

It wasn't supposed to feel like walking into a horror movie.

The air pressed heavily against her skin, thick with silence. The usual sounds of the forest chirping crickets, rustling leaves, and distant howls were gone. Something about it was wrong, and Riley wasn't the type to ignore a gut feeling.

She pulled her phone from her pocket, the glow of the screen the only light in the growing darkness. No service. Because of course.

A sharp snap echoed through the trees.

Riley froze.

A branch breaking. Something moving.

She told herself it was just a deer. A raccoon. Anything normal.

But the feeling creeping up her spine wasn't normal. It was the kind of instinct she couldn't explain, the kind that made every cell in her body scream and run.

And then she saw them.

Two figures, barely visible in the shadows between the trees.

Not figures.

Eyes.

Glowing, golden eyes that burned through the darkness.

Riley's breath caught in her throat as she took a slow step back. The figures moved, too fast, too fluid like something wild, something dangerous.

Then snarling. Low, guttural, not human.

Her pulse slammed against her ribs.

She turned and ran.

The forest blurred around her as she sprinted, branches whipping against her arms, rain starting to fall in sharp, cold droplets. The ground was slick and uneven, but she didn't stop she couldn't stop.

The sound of footsteps pounded behind her. Not one set. Two.

Too fast. Too close.

I'm not going to make it.

Then something crashed into her from the side.

The impact sent her flying, her breath ripped from her lungs as she hit the ground. Pain shot through her shoulder, leaves, and dirt pressing against her skin.

Before she could move before she could even think, the shadow loomed over her.

A creature.

Not a wolf. Not a man. Something in between.

It stood on two legs, its massive frame

The creature towered over Riley, half-shadow, half-nightmare. It stood on two legs, but its body was covered in dark, coarse fur. Its hands and claws flexed at its sides, and its golden eyes burned with something almost human.

Almost.

Riley couldn't move. Couldn't scream.

Then the second one stepped into the clearing.

This one was different leaner, its fur a lighter shade, eyes gleaming a deep, unnatural red. It was watching the first creature, not her. And something in the way its lips curled back, exposing long, gleaming fangs, told her that whatever was happening, she wasn't the one it was hunting.

The first wolf the bigger one turned to face the red-eyed one.

A low growl rumbled from its chest, a sound so deep that Riley felt it in her bones. The red-eyed wolf growled back, stepping forward, muscles tensed.

They weren't just animals.

They were fighting.

And Riley was caught in the middle of it.

Her survival instinct kicked in. She scrambled backward, fingers digging into the damp earth, every inch of her body screaming at her to move, now, before they remembered she was here.

But before she could push herself up, the red-eyed wolf lunged.

It was too fast just a blur of movement, claws slicing through the air. The bigger wolf dodged, pivoting with an impossible kind of grace before slamming into its attacker with bone-crushing force.

The sound of impact sent shockwaves through the night.

The red-eyed wolf snarled, snapping at the bigger one's throat. They tumbled through the dirt and leaves, claws slashing, teeth bared. For a moment, Riley couldn't tell who was winning just flashes of fur, growls that sounded almost like words, and the metallic scent of blood in the air.

Then a yelp.

The bigger wolf had the other pinned, teeth buried in its shoulder.

The red-eyed wolf thrashed, kicking up dirt, but the hold was too strong. With one final, guttural snarl, the bigger wolf threw it back, sending it crashing against a tree.

Silence.

Riley barely breathed as she watched the red-eyed wolf stagger to its feet, shaking with rage. It turned its glowing gaze toward the bigger wolf, snarled one last time then bolted into the darkness.

The storm swallowed the sound of its retreat.

The only thing left in the clearing was the remaining wolf. And Riley.

Her heart was a wild drum in her chest. She forced herself to move, crawling backward, desperate to get away before

The wolf turned to her.

Not just turned. Looked at her.

Like it knew her.

Riley's breath hitched as she met those golden eyes. Closer now, she could see flecks of hazel buried beneath the glow, something almost familiar.

The wolf took a slow step toward her.

She froze.

Then impossibly, horrifyingly it shifted.

One moment, a massive wolf was standing in front of her.

The next, a boy was kneeling in its place.

His body was bare except for the shadows and streaks of blood on his skin. His dark, rain-soaked hair clung to his forehead, his sharp jawline bruised.

And his eyes.

Golden, still burning, but unmistakably human now.

Riley knew that face.

Everyone at Silverwood High did.

Kieran Wolfe.

The guy who had shown up in town two months ago with a reputation that reeked of trouble. The guy who never talked to anyone, who always looked like he was one wrong move away from wrecking something.

The guy who had just turned into a wolf right in front of her.

Riley's body finally caught up to her brain. She scrambled to her feet, ignoring the way her limbs trembled.

"What the" Her voice broke. "What the hell was that?"

Kieran didn't answer immediately. His breathing was rough, and uneven, his muscles still shaking like shifting had drained every ounce of strength from him.

Then he exhaled a slow, sharp breath, and lifted his gaze to hers.

"That," he said, voice hoarse but steady, "was me saving your life."

Riley's pulse thundered. Her hands clenched at her sides.

A normal person would've thanked him. A normal person would've run.

Riley wasn't normal.

She took a step back.

Kieran frowned. "You're scared."

"No kidding," she snapped. "I just watched you" She gestured at him, still unable to fully process what she'd seen. "You, you turned into a freaking wolf!"

Kieran flinched, but not from the words. His eyes flickered toward the darkness where the red-eyed wolf had disappeared.

"He'll be back," he muttered, mostly to himself.

Riley's chest tightened. "Who will be back?"

Kieran's gaze slid back to hers. His lips pressed into a hard line.

"You need to go home, Riley."

Her stomach dropped.

He knew her name.

She had never spoken to Kieran Wolfe a day in her life, but he knew exactly who she was.

She should've run. Should've done the smart thing, turned around, and never looked back.

But Riley Hayes had never been good at walking away from a mystery.

And right now, Kieran Wolfe was the biggest damn mystery Silverwood had ever seen.

So instead of running, she folded her arms and met his stare head-on.

"You just fought whatever that thing was, turned into a wolf, and you think I'm just going to go home like nothing happened?"

Kieran sighed like he didn't have the patience for this. "That would be the smart thing to do."

Riley narrowed her eyes. "Yeah, well. I don't do smart."

A flicker of something crossed his face exasperation, maybe, or the barest hint of amusement.

But then the storm rumbled overhead, and whatever softness had been there vanished. Kieran stepped closer, lowering his voice.

"This isn't a game, Riley."

The way he said her name sent a chill down her spine.

"I need you to listen to me," he continued. "Forget what you saw. Forget me."

A cold, sinking feeling settled in her stomach.

"Why?" she asked. "Because it's dangerous?"

He held her gaze. "Because now they know you've seen too much."

Lightning flashed. Thunder cracked overhead.

And in that single, shattering moment, Riley knew one thing for sure.

She wasn't getting out of this alive.

Not unless she trusted the boy who had just turned into a monster.
###chapter Two: The Wolf and the Girl Who Knew Too Much
Riley's brain hadn't caught up with reality yet.

The world had tilted on its axis, and she was standing in the wreckage of everything she thought she knew.

Kieran Wolfe. The quiet, brooding new guy at school the one everyone whispered about but no one knew had just turned into a wolf in front of her. Not an ordinary wolf. A massive, terrifying, monstrous creature that had fought off something even worse.

And now, he was standing in front of her, bare-chested, bruised, and acting like she was the problem.

"You need to leave, Riley." Kieran's voice was low, rough like he wasn't fully human yet. Like there was still something untamed lurking under his skin.

Riley took another step back. Her brain was screaming at her to run, but her body was frozen in place. "You just you shifted. Into a wolf." Her voice sounded strange to her ears. "How? Why?"

Kieran exhaled through his nose like he didn't have the patience for this. "I don't have time to explain. You need to go."

Riley bristled. "I need answers."

He looked at her then, really looked at her, like he was seeing something he hadn't expected. Like he knew something she didn't.

"Answers will only get you killed."

A chill ran through her, but she forced herself to hold her ground. She wasn't going to let him intimidate her. "Yeah, well, not knowing almost got me killed too, in case you forgot."

His jaw tightened.

That was the thing about Kieran Wolfe he had this way of looking at people like he was calculating how much trouble they were worth. And right now, she could tell he was debating whether she was worth the hassle.

Finally, he sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. "Look, you shouldn't have seen what you saw. But now that you have" He trailed off, his golden eyes flicking toward the trees. "They'll come for you."

A cold dread settled in her stomach. "They? You mean ?"

"The pack."

Her breath hitched. She didn't know much about werewolf lore, but Pack sounded bad.

"So what, they just kill anyone who finds out about them?"

Kieran's expression darkened. "Depends on who finds out."

Fantastic.

Riley clenched her fists, willing herself to stay calm, even as panic curled its fingers around her throat. "Then what do I do? Pretend I didn't see anything?"

Kieran hesitated. "It's not that simple."

"Of course, it's not."

"Riley."

The way he said her name sent another chill down her spine. Not just because it was the first time she'd heard him say it, but because there was something in his voice something warning.

She swallowed. "You know my name."

His eyes flickered, almost like he regretted saying it. "Of course I do."

She frowned. "Why?"

Another pause. Another flash of something unreadable in his gaze.

Then he said, "Because you're important."

Her stomach twisted.

"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" she demanded.

Kieran didn't answer. Instead, he stepped forward, close enough that she had to crane her neck to look at him. "Go home, Riley. Stay away from the woods. Stay away from me."

And just like that, he turned and disappeared into the trees.

Riley stood there, heart hammering, until the storm swallowed him whole.

Then, finally, she ran.

Riley barely remembered the walk home.

By the time she stumbled through the front door, soaked to the bone and shaking, her mind was still struggling to process everything. The fight. The shifting. Kieran.

She pressed her back against the door, eyes squeezed shut, heartbeat thundering in her ears.

Werewolves were real.

They had always been real.

And Kieran Wolfe quiet, brooding, troublemaker Kieran was one of them.

Her stomach twisted violently. This wasn't just some supernatural fantasy. This was real. And if Kieran was telling the truth, it was dangerous.

She needed answers.

And she knew exactly where to get them.

"So, remember when you said werewolves were real?"

Nova Carter froze mid-bite into her breakfast burrito, blinking at Riley as if she had just grown a second head.

"Uh. Duh."

Riley scowled. "I'm being serious."

Nova chewed thoughtfully. "So am I. I've been telling you this for years."

Riley pinched the bridge of her nose. "No, Nova. I mean I saw one."

That got Nova's attention.

She set her burrito down, leaning forward over the cafeteria table. "Wait. Hold on. Back up. What?"

Riley exhaled. "Last night. In the woods."

Nova's eyes widened. "Tell me everything."

So she did.

By the time she finished, Nova was practically vibrating with excitement. "Holy shit. Kieran Wolfe is a werewolf?"

Riley groaned. "Not the point."

Nova ignored her. "I knew he was weird. Too hot to be normal."

Riley shot her a glare. "Again. Not the point."

Nova grinned. "Right, right. The point is you're screwed."

"Thanks."

"No, like, actually screwed." Nova's excitement dimmed slightly. "Riley, if the pack finds out you know"

"They already know."

Nova paled. "Oh."

Riley ran

Nova paled. "Oh."

That was the moment the weight of it settled in. The moment Riley saw her best friend the same girl who had spent years obsessing over werewolf conspiracy theories look scared.

Riley forced herself to swallow the lump rising in her throat. "Yeah. Oh."

Nova stared at her for a long second, then leaned in, lowering her voice. "So what exactly did Kieran say? Did he threaten you?"

Riley shook her head. "Not exactly. He just told me to forget what I saw."

Nova snorted. "Oh, sure. Let me just erase the memory of a seven-foot-tall wolf getting into a supernatural WWE match right in front of me. No big deal."

Riley shot her a look. "Nova."

"I'm just saying! That's the dumbest advice ever."

Riley sighed, rubbing her temples. "I don't think it was advice. I think it was a warning."

Nova sobered. "Okay. That's worse."

Riley didn't need the reminder. The truth was, she'd barely slept last night, lying awake in bed, replaying everything over and over again in her mind. The fight. The glowing eyes. Kieran's voice was sharp with warning.

Because now they know you've seen too much.

She wasn't safe.

And she had no idea what to do about it.

Nova must have seen the panic creeping in, because she reached across the table and grabbed Riley's hands, squeezing them tight. "Hey. You're not alone in this, okay?"

Riley forced a shaky smile. "Yeah."

Nova let go, leaning back in her chair. "So. What's the plan?"

"I was hoping you'd have one."

Nova considered. "Well, if this were a movie, we'd be looking for some kind of werewolf expert. Maybe some old guy in a dusty bookstore who speaks in riddles."

Riley arched an eyebrow. "We live in Silverwood. Our town's only bookstore is inside a Starbucks."

"Fair point." Nova tapped her fingers against the table. "Okay, plan B. We go straight to the source."

Riley frowned. "What does that mean?"

"It means," Nova said, grinning like this was the most exciting thing to ever happen, "we find Kieran Wolfe and make him talk."

Finding Kieran was easier said than done.

For someone who had just dropped the biggest supernatural bombshell of all time on her, he was nowhere.

Riley checked the hallways between classes. No sign of him. She scanned the cafeteria at lunch. Nothing. It was like he had evaporated into thin air which, given everything she'd seen last night, didn't seem impossible.

By the time the final bell rang, her frustration was at an all-time high.

Nova, ever the voice of chaos, slung an arm around Riley's shoulders as they walked toward the parking lot. "So, here's a thought: what if he's avoiding you?"

Riley scowled. "No kidding."

"Which means," Nova continued, "we have to make it impossible for him to hide."

Riley eyed her suspiciously. "What exactly are you suggesting?"

Nova grinned, mischief dancing in her eyes. "Simple. We find out where he hangs out when he's not at school."

"That's called stalking, Nova."

"That's called research, Riley."

Riley sighed. "And how exactly do we find out where he goes?"

Nova wiggled her eyebrows. "We ask the one person who pays attention to everyone in this school."

Riley groaned. "Please don't say"

"Oh, Heather Sinclair," Nova sing-songed, already veering toward the school's biggest gossip, who was currently holding court by her car with a group of cheerleaders.

Riley barely had time to protest before Nova was dragging her over.

Heather turned as they approached, flipping her perfect blonde hair over her shoulder. "Carter. Hayes." She narrowed her eyes. "What do you want?"

Nova leaned against Heather's car like she belonged there. "Information."

Heather smirked. "Obviously. What kind?"

Nova wasted no time. "Kieran Wolfe."

Heather's eyes lit up with curiosity, and Riley immediately regretted everything.

"Kieran?" Heather said, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. "Why are you two interested in him?"

Nova shrugged. "Just a friendly bet. We wanna know where he disappears to all the time."

Heather studied them for a second, clearly debating whether to spill. Then, with a dramatic sigh, she said, "He works at The Den."

Riley blinked. "The Den?"

"The auto shop on Birch Street," Heather clarified. "My dad took his car there once. Said the place is full of, like, scary hot delinquent guys who don't talk much." She gave them a knowing look. "Sounds like your boy, doesn't it?"

"He's not my boy," Riley said quickly, ignoring Nova's smirk.

Heather raised an eyebrow but didn't push. "Anyway, if you're looking for him, I'd try there."

Nova clapped her hands. "You're the best, Heather."

Heather gave her a look. "I know."

Riley sighed as Nova dragged her away, already buzzing with excitement. "See? That wasn't so hard."

"I can't believe we're doing this."

Nova grinned. "Believe it, babe. We're going werewolf hunting."

The Den looked exactly like its name suggested a run-down auto shop on the edge of town, tucked between a mechanic's garage and a bar that never seemed to close. The neon sign flickered above the entrance, casting an eerie red glow across the parking lot.

Riley hesitated as they stepped onto the cracked pavement. "This is a terrible idea."

Nova elbowed her. "Relax. We're just here to talk."

Riley wasn't convinced.

Through the open garage doors, she could see a few guys working on cars tall, broad-shouldered, and exactly the type of people her mom would tell her to stay away from.

And then she saw him.

Kieran.

He was leaning against a motorcycle, his leather jacket hanging off one shoulder, hair still damp from sweat. He looked different here less guarded, like he belonged in the shadows and the scent of gasoline.

And when his golden eyes flicked up and locked onto her, Riley's breath caught.

He pushed off the bike, walking toward them with a slow, measured pace. His expression was unreadable, but there was something sharp in his gaze something that said, you shouldn't be here.

Riley lifted her chin. Too bad.

Kieran stopped in front of them, crossing his arms. "You shouldn't be here."

Yep. Called it.

Nova, ever fearless, grinned. "Nice to see you too, Wolfe."

Kieran ignored her, eyes locked on Riley. "I told you to stay away."

Riley crossed her arms, mirroring his stance. "Yeah, well. You told me a lot of things. None of them were answers."

Kieran exhaled through his nose. "Riley"

"No. You don't get to do that." Her voice was steady, even as her heart pounded. "You don't get to drop that on me and then walk away like nothing happened."

Something flashed in his eyes frustration, maybe. Or something else.

One of the guys from the garage wandered over, wiping grease off his hands. "Yo, Wolfe. Everything good?"

Kieran didn't look away from Riley. "Yeah. I got it."

The guy raised an eyebrow but didn't push. He gave Riley and Nova a slow once-over, then shrugged and walked off.

Kieran turned back to them. "You need to leave."

"No," Riley said, surprising even herself. "I need you to tell me what's going on."

Kieran's jaw tightened.

Nova took a step closer, her usual playfulness gone. "Listen, dude. She saw everything. You think she can just pretend it didn't happen?"

Kieran looked at Riley again, something unreadable flickering in his gaze. "I think she should."

Riley bristled. "Well, I can't. And I won't."

For a long moment, he just stared at her. Then, finally, he sighed.

"You really want answers?"

"Yes."

He glanced toward the woods behind the shop, then back at her. "Fine."

Riley's pulse quickened. "Fine?"

"Meet me at the edge of the forest. Midnight."

Nova made a noise of protest. "Oh, hell no"

Kieran cut her a look. "Come alone."

Then, without another word, he turned and walked away, disappearing back into the garage.

Nova turned to Riley, arms flailing. "You are not seriously considering this."

Riley swallowed hard.

She wasn't just considering it.

She knew she was going.

Because something about Kieran Wolfe told her this was bigger than just one night in the woods.

And for better or worse

She was already in too deep.
###chapter Three: The Boy Who Runs with Wolves
Midnight came faster than Riley expected.

She spent the rest of the evening pacing her room, her mind a tangled mess of thoughts. Every instinct told her she should not be doing this sneaking into the woods alone to meet a werewolf sounded like the beginning of a horror movie.

But she couldn't ignore the feeling in her gut. The feeling that this was important. That Kieran knew something about the world she'd unknowingly stepped into.

And that if she didn't meet him tonight, she might never get another chance.

So at 11:45 PM, she threw on a hoodie, laced up her sneakers, and climbed out her bedroom window.

The streets of Silverwood were empty as she made her way toward the forest. The town always felt a little eerie at night, the mist curling around streetlights, the air thick with something almost unnatural.

Or maybe that was just her, knowing what lurked beyond the trees.

By the time she reached the meeting spot a clearing just beyond the tree line her heart was pounding.

Kieran was already there.

He stood with his back to her, arms crossed, his head tilted slightly like he'd heard her coming before she even stepped on a branch. Which, let's be real he probably had.

"You came." His voice was low, unreadable.

Riley shoved her hands into her hoodie pocket. "You did say I had to."

He turned, and even in the dim moonlight, his golden eyes caught the glow. "I didn't think you'd listen."

"Yeah, well. First time for everything."

For a second, neither of them spoke. The silence stretched, thick with something unspoken.

Then Kieran sighed. "If you're here for answers, you'd better be sure you want them."

Riley tensed. "Why wouldn't I?"

His gaze met hers, something sharp and warning in his expression. "Because once you know the truth, you don't get to unknow it."

A chill ran down her spine.

But she squared her shoulders. "I think it's a little late for that."

Kieran studied her for a long moment, then nodded slightly like he'd expected that answer.

"Fine," he murmured. "You want the truth? Here it is."

He took a step forward, and Riley had the sudden, unsettling feeling that she was standing at the edge of a cliff.

"There are two packs in Silverwood," Kieran said. "The one that runs this town the one that keeps humans in the dark and the one I used to be part of."

Riley's breath caught. "Used to be?"

Kieran's jaw tightened. "I'm not one of them anymore."

Something about the way he said it made her stomach twist.

"Why?" she asked.

For a second, Kieran hesitated.

Then he said, "Because I broke their rules."

A cold wind rustled the trees, and Riley shivered, but she didn't look away. "What kind of rules?"

Kieran's gaze darkened. "The kind that gets people killed."

Silence.

Something about the way he said it flat, emotionless-sent a chill through her.

"You don't have to be scared of me," Kieran said suddenly.

Riley blinked. "I'm not."

He arched a skeptical eyebrow.

"I mean, not of you specifically," she corrected. "Just everything else."

Kieran huffed a quiet laugh. "Fair."

For a second, the tension cracked, just enough for Riley to remember Kieran might be a werewolf, but he was also just a boy.

A boy who had saved her life.

A boy who had been alone ever since.

She swallowed. "So what happens now?"

Kieran's expression hardened. "Now? You stay out of this."

Riley scowled. "Yeah, see, that's not gonna work for me."

Kieran sighed. "Of course, it's not."

"I saw that thing last night," Riley pressed. "The one with the red eyes. It was trying to kill you, wasn't it?"

Kieran's face darkened. "It wasn't trying."

Her stomach twisted. "Who was it?"

Kieran hesitated. Then: "His name is Callum Drake."

Riley frowned. "Wait, Callum? As in Callum Drake?"

Kieran's expression turned ice-cold. "You know him?"

"Not know him," Riley said quickly. "But everyone at school does. He's the guy who owns the football team. Super charming, super perfect. Everyone loves him."

Kieran's jaw clenched. "Yeah. That's what he wants you to think."

A sick feeling settled in Riley's stomach.

"How" She swallowed. "How is he a werewolf?"

"Because his father is the Alpha."

Everything in Riley went still.

The Alpha. The leader of the pack. The one who wanted Kieran dead.

"So last night" she said slowly. "That wasn't just a random attack."

Kieran exhaled sharply. "No."

Riley's hands clenched into fists. "Then why are you here? If the pack is after you, why haven't you left Silverwood?"

Kieran was quiet for a long moment.

Then he said, "Because I have unfinished business."

Something in the way he said it made Riley's skin prickle.

But before she could press him for more

A howl split the night.

Low. Echoing. Too close.

Riley's heart stuttered.

Kieran went rigid. His head snapped toward the trees, eyes flickering gold.

"Shit," he muttered.

"What?" Riley whispered.

Kieran turned to her, his golden eyes flashing in the darkness. "Run."

Riley's breath hitched. "What"

Another howl cut through the night, closer this time. Too close.

Kieran's body tensed, muscles coiling like he was preparing for a fight. "Go, Riley. Now."

But Riley couldn't move. Her legs were frozen, her brain struggling to process the very real danger lurking just beyond the trees.

Then she saw them.

Two figures emerge from the shadows. Not fully human. Not fully wolf. Something in between.

Their glowing red eyes locked onto her.

Kieran let out a sharp snarl and stepped in front of her. "She's not part of this."

One of the wolves taller, broader, with a cruel smirk stretching across his half-shifted face, tilted his head. "Then why is she here?"

Kieran's hands clenched into fists. "She's leaving."

The second wolf chuckled. "Not so sure about that."

Panic surged in Riley's chest.

Kieran's stance shifted protective like he was ready to throw himself between her and them.

She couldn't let him.

"Riley." His voice was tight. Controlled. "When I say run, you run."

She swallowed hard. "And what about you?"

"I'll handle them."

There was something final in the way he said it.

Like he didn't expect to walk away from this.

The thought sent a cold wave of fear crashing through her.

"No," she said suddenly. "Not without you."

Kieran turned his head slightly, just enough for their eyes to meet.

That second of hesitation was all it took.

The bigger wolf lunged.

Kieran barely had time to shift. One second, he was human the next, he was something else.

Fur. Claws. Teeth.

The impact sent them both crashing to the ground.

The second wolf turned on Riley.

Her body moved before her brain could catch up. Run.

She spun on her heel and bolted into the trees.

The forest blurred around her, branches snapping against her arms, the sound of snarling and growling filling the air behind her. Her heart pounded against her ribs.

She had no idea where she was going just that she had to move.

Leaves rustled to her left. A figure streaked through the trees, keeping pace with her.

Not Kieran.

Panic shot through her veins.

She pushed herself faster, but her breath was coming too fast, her legs burning with effort.

A shadow moved ahead.

No, no, no

A figure stepped onto the path in front of her.

Riley skidded to a stop, nearly crashing into him.

Tall. Blond. Clean-cut.

And smiling.

"Going somewhere?"

Her stomach dropped.

Callum Drake.

Up close, he looked nothing like the golden boy everyone at school admired.

His sharp blue eyes gleamed with something cold, something predatory.

She took a shaky step back.

He stepped forward. "I was hoping we'd get the chance to talk."

Riley's blood ran cold.

This is bad. This is really, bad.

Callum tilted his head. "You look terrified."

"No kidding."

His smirk deepened. "Smart girl."

The movement behind her.

She barely had time to react before strong arms grabbed her.

She thrashed, and kicked, but the grip was like iron.

"Let me go!" she snarled.

Callum just sighed, like she was being difficult on purpose. "You're making this harder than it needs to be."

Riley's heart pounded. Think, think, think

Then, from somewhere deep in the woods

A growl.

Fierce. Low.

The kind that promised violence.

Callum's head snapped toward the sound.

The second his attention shifted, Riley moved.

She stomped down hard on the foot of whoever was holding her.

The grip loosened just enough.

She wrenched free and ran.

Callum cursed behind her. "Go after her."

Riley didn't look back.

The forest blurred around her again. Her lungs burned, her legs ached, but she didn't stop.

Then out of nowhere, something crashed into her.

The world spun as she hit the ground, the wind knocked out of her lungs.

She gasped, struggling to get up.

But the second she lifted her head, she froze.

Because standing over her, eyes burning gold, was Kieran.

Not human. Not wolf.

Something in between.

His body trembled, his claws still dripping with blood.

But his eyes his eyes locked onto hers.

And just for a moment, she saw it.

The fear.

Not of her.

For her.

Then his gaze lifted, locking onto something behind her.

A snarl ripped from his throat.

Before Riley could even turn, he moved.

Faster than she thought possible, launching past her, tackling something out of view.

A cry of pain. A violent snarl.

Riley scrambled to her feet, heart hammering, her vision swimming.

Kieran and one of Callum's wolves crashed into the trees, a blur of claws and teeth and fury.

She barely had time to register the fight before a hand grabbed her wrist.

She whirled, ready to fight.

But it wasn't an enemy.

It was Nova.

"Riley, we have to go. Now."

Riley's brain struggled to catch up. "How"

Nova shook her. "Later. Move!"

Riley didn't argue.

Together, they ran.

The chaos of the fight faded behind them, but Riley knew it wasn't over.

Not even close.

And she had the sinking feeling that after tonight

Nothing in Silverwood would ever be the same again.
###chapter Four: The Pack Never Forgets
Riley didn't stop running until her lungs burned and her legs felt like they were about to give out.

The forest had never felt so endless. Every snapping twig, every rustling branch sent a fresh wave of panic through her veins.

Nova pulled her along, her grip like iron around Riley's wrist. "Come on, we're almost there!"

Riley wasn't sure where there was, but she followed anyway, too shaken to think. Behind them, the sounds of fighting had faded, but she knew Kieran was still back there alone.

A cold weight settled in her stomach.

Leaving him felt wrong.

But what could she do? He was one of them. He could handle himself. Right?

Nova suddenly veered to the right, pulling Riley off the main path.

They broke through the tree line and stumbled onto a quiet side street. It was eerily empty no late-night cars, no porch lights flickering on. Just the hum of the wind and the distant sound of crickets.

Nova didn't stop until they reached her car, a beat-up Jeep parked half a block away. She yanked open the door, practically shoving Riley inside before scrambling behind the wheel.

The second the doors slammed shut, silence fell.

Riley pressed her hands against the dashboard, her breath still coming fast.

For a moment, neither of them spoke.

Then Nova turned to her, eyes wide. "What the hell was that?"

Riley let out a shaky laugh half-hysterical, half-disbelieving. "I think we just got chased by a pack of actual, real-life werewolves."

Nova groaned, dropping her forehead against the steering wheel. "This is not how I thought my night was gonna go."

Riley swallowed hard. "Me neither."

Silence stretched between them, heavy with everything they weren't saying.

Then Nova lifted her head. "Okay. We need a plan."

Riley exhaled. "We need answers."

Nova nodded. "Right. And there's only one person who can give us those."

They both knew exactly who she meant.

Kieran.

The only problem?

She had no idea if he was even still alive.

They spent the next two hours driving aimlessly around Silverwood, trying to figure out where Kieran might have gone.

The Den was locked up for the night. The streets were empty.

And Riley was losing hope.

"We should've stayed," she muttered, staring out the window as Nova pulled onto Main Street.

Nova gave her a look. "And done what, exactly? Gotten torn to shreds?"

Riley clenched her fists. "I don't know. But we just left him there."

Nova sighed, drumming her fingers against the steering wheel. "He told you to run, right? That means he knew what he was doing."

Riley bit her lip. "What if he didn't?"

Before Nova could answer, something thumped against the roof of the car.

Both girls screamed.

Nova slammed the brakes, the Jeep skidding to a stop in the middle of the empty street.

Silence.

Then a groan.

Nova turned to Riley slowly. "Tell me that was a tree branch."

Riley swallowed. "That was not a tree branch."

Nova reached for a flashlight from the glove compartment, hands shaking. "Okay. On three, we look."

Riley nodded, heart pounding. "One."

"Two."

"Three."

They both whipped their heads toward the windshield-

just in time to see Kieran Wolfe slide off the hood and hit the pavement with a dull thud.

Riley was out of the car before she could think.

"Kieran!"

He didn't move.

Her stomach twisted as she knelt beside him, her fingers hovering just over his shoulder. His jacket was torn, his shirt barely clinging to his frame, and blood so much blood streaked down his arms and neck.

But he was breathing.

Barely.

Nova crouched beside her, eyes wide. "Oh my god, he looks dead."

"He's not," Riley said quickly, pressing her fingers to his pulse. It was faint but steady.

Kieran let out a low groan, his face scrunching up like he was fighting his way back to consciousness.

Then, suddenly his hand shot out, grabbing Riley's wrist.

She gasped, her heart jumping into her throat.

His golden eyes fluttered open, hazy but still burning.

"Riley" His voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.

"I'm here," she said, surprised by how steady she sounded. "You're safe."

Kieran's gaze flickered like he wasn't fully processing her words. Then his fingers tightened around her wrist.

And the next thing he said sent ice through her veins.

"They're coming."

Riley's stomach plummeted.

She glanced at Nova, who had heard it too because she was already scrambling for the car door. "Nope. Nope, nope. We are not waiting around to find out who they are."

Riley hooked an arm under Kieran's shoulder. "Come on. We have to get you out of here."

He grunted in pain but didn't fight her. Together, she and Nova dragged him toward the Jeep, practically shoving him into the backseat.

Nova floored the gas before Riley even had the door shut.

The Jeep sped down the road, tires screeching against the pavement.

Riley twisted in her seat, watching Kieran through the rearview mirror. His head lolled back against the seat, his breaths coming in uneven gasps.

"Hey," she said softly, reaching back to shake his knee. "Stay awake, okay?"

Kieran's lips twitched in something that might have been amusement if he didn't look like he was about to pass out. "I'm fine."

"You're bleeding everywhere."

"Still fine."

Nova scoffed. "Yeah, dude. Hate to break it to you, but you look like you just lost a fight with a lawnmower."

Kieran didn't respond. His eyelids fluttered.

Riley shook him again. "Kieran."

This time, his eyes barely opened. His body slumped further against the seat.

Panic clawed at Riley's chest.

"Nova, we need to get him somewhere safe now."

Nova gritted her teeth. "I'm working on it."

They couldn't take him to a hospital. They couldn't take him to her house.

Which left only one option.

Riley took a deep breath. "Drive to my dad's cabin."

Nova shot her a look. "Riley, that place is practically abandoned."

"Exactly. No one will look for him there."

Nova hesitated then nodded.

She veered off the main road, heading toward the outskirts of town.

And as the trees swallowed them whole, Riley couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning.

Because Kieran had said something before he blacked out.

Something that made her blood run cold.

They're coming.

And if that was true

Then no matter where they ran

The pack would find them.

The road to her dad's old cabin was nothing but darkness and winding turns.

Riley kept glancing at Kieran in the backseat, her stomach twisting every time his head lolled to the side. His breathing was uneven, his shirt soaked with blood, and he hadn't spoken since muttering those two chilling words: They're coming.

She didn't know how much longer he could hold on.

"Nova, step on it," she said, voice tight.

Nova gripped the wheel like her life depended on it. "I'm already going fifteen over, Riley. This Jeep is not built for high-speed chases."

Riley turned back to Kieran, shaking his shoulder. "Stay with me, Wolfe."

He groaned in response but didn't open his eyes.

Nova shot her a nervous glance. "Are we even sure the cabin is still there? You haven't been back since"

"Since my dad disappeared?" Riley finished, not bothering to keep the bitterness out of her voice. "Yeah, I know."

Nova winced. "Sorry, I didn't mean"

"It's fine," Riley muttered. "And yeah, it's still there. My mom refuses to sell it. Says it's part of his legacy or whatever."

Nova exhaled. "Right. Legacy. Super comforting, considering your dad vanished in the Silverwood woods."

Riley didn't respond.

Because yeah, she had thought about that. More than once.

Her dad's disappearance had never made sense. One day, he went for a walk in the woods. Never came back. Nobody, no clues-just gone.

And now she knew for a fact that monsters lived in those trees.

Was it connected?

Was her dad just another name on the pack's kill list?

She pushed the thought down, forcing herself to focus. Right now, Kieran was the priority.

Ten minutes later, Nova turned onto a narrow dirt road, the Jeep bouncing over potholes and roots. The forest thickened around them, swallowing them whole.

And then, finally

A clearing.

The cabin stood at the center, dark and untouched, surrounded by nothing but trees and silence.

Nova killed the engine. "This is the part where the horror movie music starts playing."

Riley ignored her, already opening the door. "Help me get him inside."

They pulled Kieran out of the Jeep, half-carrying, half-dragging him toward the porch. He was deadweight, barely conscious, but he made a weak attempt at walking.

"Damn, dude," Nova muttered, struggling under his weight. "You need to lay off the protein shakes."

Kieran let out a noise that might have been a laugh. Or a groan. Hard to tell.

Riley pushed open the cabin door, the smell of dust and pine hitting her instantly. Everything was exactly how they had left it-furniture covered in sheets, firewood stacked by the hearth, her dad's old coat still hanging by the door.

She swallowed hard, shoving away the memories.

"Couch," she said, and they maneuvered Kieran onto it. He slumped against the cushions, eyes barely open.

Nova collapsed onto the floor, catching her breath. "This is not how I thought tonight was gonna go."

Riley ignored her, grabbing the first-aid kit from the kitchen. She knelt beside Kieran, pulling his jacket and shirt aside.

The second she saw the wounds, her stomach turned.

Deep claw marks ran across his ribs and shoulder, the edges raw and still bleeding. His skin was already bruising, turning ugly shades of purple and black.

Riley's hands shook.

"You should be dead," she murmured.

Kieran let out a weak chuckle. "Not that lucky."

She shot him a glare. "That's not funny."

His golden eyes flickered, something softer in them. "Didn't say it was."

Nova peeked over Riley's shoulder. "So, uh. Shouldn't he be healing or something? I thought werewolves had, like, super regeneration powers."

Kieran exhaled. "Takes longer when the wounds are from another wolf."

Riley's chest tightened. "Callum did this to you."

Kieran didn't answer.

Which was an answer in itself.

Nova blew out a breath. "Okay, so what now? We just hide out here forever?"

Kieran shifted, wincing. "They'll find me eventually."

Riley frowned. "So you're saying this is pointless?"

"No." He met her gaze. "I'm saying it's temporary."

Riley studied him. "Then what's the plan?"

Kieran hesitated. Then he said, "We hit back first."

Nova gaped. "Oh, sure. Let's go fight the literal werewolf mafia. Sounds fun."

Kieran's jaw tightened. "If we don't, they won't stop."

Riley's pulse pounded. "We?"

Kieran looked at her. "You're in this now, Riley. Whether you like it or not."

Her stomach flipped.

Because as much as she wanted to argue

He was right.

She had seen too much.

And the pack never forgot.
###chapter Five: The Pack Strikes First
The cabin was quiet. Too quiet.

Riley sat on the floor beside the couch, watching the fire flicker in the stone hearth. The only sounds were the occasional crackle of the flames and Kieran's slow, unsteady breathing.

Nova had passed out in one of the armchairs an hour ago, exhausted from the night's insanity. But Riley couldn't sleep. Not after everything that had happened.

Not with him lying just a few feet away, barely holding on.

She glanced at Kieran. His face was pale under the bruises, his shirtless torso covered in bandages. Despite the wounds, he looked peaceful, his chest rising and falling in shallow breaths.

The moment felt too fragile, like if she let herself look for too long, he'd disappear.

Her fingers tightened around her knees.

"What now?" she murmured.

She hadn't meant to say it out loud, but Kieran shifted slightly, his eyes half-opening. "You should sleep."

Riley scoffed. "So should you."

He exhaled a weak laugh. "Touché."

Silence stretched between them.

Then Kieran spoke again, quieter this time. "You regret it?"

She frowned. "Regret what?"

"Not running when you had the chance."

Riley swallowed hard. "No."

Kieran studied her, something unreadable flickering in his golden gaze. "You should."

The words stung more than they should have.

Before she could respond, a distant howl echoed through the trees.

Riley stiffened.

Kieran's body went rigid. His hand clenched into a fist against the couch.

A second howl followed. Closer.

Too close.

Riley's pulse spiked. "That's them, isn't it?"

Kieran didn't move, but his voice was sharper now. "Wake Nova. Now."

Riley didn't waste time asking questions. She scrambled to her feet, rushing over to Nova's chair.

"Nova, wake up." She shook her. "We need to"

CRASH.

The cabin's front window shattered.

Riley barely had time to register the explosion of glass before a figure lunged through the broken window, landing in a crouch.

A man.

Noa wolf.

Half-shifted, muscles bulging, claws extended.

And red eyes locked directly on her.

Time slowed.

Riley took a shaky step back, her mind struggling to process what was happening.

The wolf-man one of Callum's pack rose to his full height, easily over six feet of pure muscle and predatory instinct. His lips curled back, exposing long, gleaming fangs.

Then, he moved.

Too fast.

Riley barely had time to duck.

A clawed hand swiped inches from her head, slamming into the wooden beam behind her. Splinters rained down, but she didn't stop moving she ran.

"Nova, MOVE!" she screamed.

Nova jolted awake just as another figure crashed through the door.

Two of them.

Riley's stomach dropped.

This wasn't an ambush.

It was a hunt.

Kieran let out a low, guttural snarl.

The moment he tried to move, though, his body gave out, his injuries keeping him pinned.

The first wolf lunged for Riley again.

This time, she had nowhere to go.

She braced for impact

CRACK.

The wolf staggered.

Nova stood behind him, gripping a broken chair leg like a baseball bat. "Yeah, that's right, you furry bastard," she panted. "I play softball."

Riley didn't wait for him to recover. She grabbed Nova's hand and ran.

They sprinted toward the back door, but the second wolf was already there, blocking their escape.

Riley skidded to a stop.

Trapped.

The first wolf snarled, shaking off Nova's hit, his red eyes burning with fury.

Kieran moved.

One second, he collapsed on the couch. The next, he was on his feet, eyes blazing gold.

The first wolf barely had time to react before Kieran was on him.

A blur of motion. A sickening crunch.

The wolf collapsed.

Riley's breath hitched.

Kieran stood over the fallen wolf, his body shaking, his wounds reopening. Blood dripped from his hands, but his golden eyes locked onto the second intruder.

"Try me," he growled

The second wolf hesitated.

He wasn't afraid not yet. But he was calculating.

Kieran was injured, barely standing, but he had already taken down one of them. And if there was one thing wolves understood, it was power.

For a moment, no one moved.

The air was thick with tension, the only sounds were the crackling of the fire and the shallow, uneven breathing of the man on the floor.

Then the second wolf smirked.

"You're weaker than I expected, Wolfe." His voice was smooth, taunting.

Kieran's lip curled. "Come find out."

The wolf chuckled but didn't take the bait. Instead, his red eyes flickered to Riley and Nova.

Kieran moved instantly, stepping in front of them, his body tense like a drawn bowstring.

The wolf sighed. "Relax. If I wanted to rip them apart, I would've done it already."

Riley's stomach turned, but she forced herself to stand tall. Don't show fear.

Kieran's voice was ice. "Get out."

The wolf ignored him, eyes flicking back to Riley. "Callum wanted me to deliver a message."

She clenched her fists. "Yeah? Next time tell him to text me like a normal person instead of breaking into my house."

Nova snorted. "For real. Ever heard of knocking?"

The wolf smiled, amused. "Callum says you don't belong in this world, Riley Hayes." His gaze sharpened. "But if you insist on sticking your nose where it doesn't belong he's more than happy to rip it off your face."

Riley's pulse hammered, but she didn't flinch. "Tell Callum he can go to hell."

The wolf chuckled. "I'll be sure to pass that along."

Then he turned and walked out.

Just like that.

Riley didn't move until she heard his footsteps fade into the night.

Then, finally, she breathed.

Nova collapsed into a chair, running a hand through her hair. "I hate this town."

Kieran didn't relax. His body was still wired, golden eyes locked on the broken window like he expected them to come back.

They wouldn't. Not tonight.

But the warning was clear.

They weren't safe.

Not anymore.

Riley turned to Kieran. "You okay?"

He exhaled slowly, rubbing a hand down his face. "Not even close."

She bit her lip. "We need to do something."

Kieran sat heavily on the couch, wincing. "We will."

Nova crossed her arms. "Oh yeah? And what's the plan, wolf boy? Because right now, we're losing."

Kieran met her gaze, his expression grim. "Not for long."

Something in his voice sent a chill down Riley's spine.

Because he meant it.

Whatever was coming next Kieran was ready to end it.

Riley swallowed hard, watching as he ran a hand through his blood-matted hair. He looked exhausted and wrecked but beneath all the pain, there was something dangerous lurking in his golden eyes.

Determination.

Vengeance.

"We need to leave," he said finally.

Nova frowned. "Leave? As in, run?"

Kieran shook his head. "No. As in, regroup. Find somewhere safer. This cabin won't hold if they come back."

Riley's stomach twisted. This place was supposed to be safe. The last piece of her father she had left. And now the pack had tainted it, just like they had tainted everything else.

But Kieran was right.

They had to move.

She took a shaky breath. "Where do we go?"

Kieran hesitated.

Then he said, "There's someone I know. Someone who might help us."

Riley narrowed her eyes. "Who?"

Kieran's jaw tensed. "An old friend."

Riley didn't like the way he said it. "Can we trust them?"

Kieran met her gaze. "We don't have a choice."

Nova groaned. "Oh, great. Love that for us."

Kieran pushed himself up, swaying slightly. Riley stepped forward on instinct, catching his arm before he could fall.

He stiffened, golden eyes flicking to hers.

"I'm fine," he muttered.

Riley rolled her eyes. "Yeah, sure. You look fantastic. Very alive and not dying."

He smirked. "I appreciate the concern."

She scowled. "I'm not concerned. I just don't want you bleeding out in my dad's cabin."

Kieran chuckled low, rough. "Liar."

Riley's face heated, but before she could snap back, Nova groaned. "Ugh. Can you two not flirt while we're being hunted?"

Riley and Kieran both stiffened.

"We're not"

Nova rolled her eyes. "Yeah, yeah. Save it for after we survive."

Riley huffed but didn't argue.

Because surviving was the only thing that mattered right now.

Kieran straightened, his expression hardening again. "We leave at dawn."

Riley nodded.

Because after tonight, one thing was clear.

The pack wasn't going to stop.

And if they wanted to make it out of this alive

They had to be ready to fight back.
###chapter 6: Blood and Betrayal
The smell of blood and splintered wood clung to the air. The cabin, once Riley's last safe place, now felt tainted and violated by the presence of wolves who had no right to be there. The broken window let in a cold draft, sending a shiver through her as she stood in the wreckage of what had once been her father's refuge.

The silence after the attack was almost worse than the fight itself.

Nova sat slumped in a chair, rubbing her temples like she had the world's worst migraine. Kieran was still standing, but barely his body swayed slightly, his hand gripping the edge of the couch for balance. His golden eyes remained locked on the shattered doorway as if expecting the wolves to come back.

"They won't return tonight," Riley said, trying to convince herself as much as them.

Kieran didn't respond right away. When he finally spoke, his voice was raw, edged with barely restrained fury. "No. But they will come back."

Riley swallowed hard, glancing at Nova, then back to Kieran. "Then we leave. Like you said."

Nova let out a humorless laugh. "Right. Because running has worked so well for us so far."

Riley shot her a sharp look. "Do you have a better idea?"

Nova sighed, rubbing her hands over her face. "No. But I'm not loving the plan we've got either."

Kieran exhaled heavily and sank onto the couch, wincing as he did. Riley hesitated before moving toward him, kneeling in front of where he sat. His injuries were bad. The bandages she had wrapped around his torso earlier were already soaked through with fresh blood.

"You're pushing yourself too hard," she muttered, reaching for the bandage on his shoulder.

Kieran caught her wrist before she could touch him. His hand was warm despite the chill settling into the cabin. "I'm fine."

Riley narrowed her eyes. "Yeah, sure. Because bleeding all over my floor is a normal, healthy thing to do."

Kieran's lips quirked, but there was no real humor in it. "I've had worse."

"That doesn't make it better."

His golden gaze flickered with something unreadable, but then he let go of her wrist, allowing her to check his wound. Riley carefully peeled back the soaked bandage, suppressing a grimace at the sight beneath it. The gash was deep, the edges jagged. It should have already begun healing.

It wasn't.

Riley frowned. "This isn't normal, is it?"

Kieran was quiet for a moment before shaking his head. "No."

Nova leaned forward. "Wait, what do you mean no? You're a werewolf. You're supposed to heal fast, right?"

Kieran's jaw clenched. "Usually."

A pit formed in Riley's stomach. "Then why aren't you?"

Kieran didn't answer. He didn't have to.

They all knew the reason.

The mark.

Ever since he had marked her accidentally or not something had changed. And now, that something was affecting him.

Riley pressed a hand against the wound, applying pressure. "Is there anything we can do to fix this?"

Kieran let out a slow breath. "We don't know what this is. And we don't have time to figure it out."

He was right. Dawn was only a few hours away.

Riley took a deep breath and stood, forcing herself to focus. "Okay. We move now. Grab only what we need. We'll figure out the rest later."

Nova snorted. "Fantastic. I love having absolutely no plan."

Kieran pushed himself to his feet, his face betraying the pain he was trying to hide. "We're not going far. Just enough to get off the pack's radar. I know someone who might be able to help."

Riley frowned. "Who?"

Kieran hesitated, but then said, "An old friend."

Nova arched a brow. "Do we trust this old friend?"

Kieran didn't answer immediately, which wasn't exactly comforting.

Riley crossed her arms. "Kieran"

Finally, he exhaled. "We don't have a choice."

The weight of those words settled over them.

Nova groaned. "Awesome. Love that for us."

Riley moved toward the hallway, grabbing a backpack she had stored in the closet. Her father had always kept supplies here extra food, medical kits, and emergency cash. He had never explained why, but now, she wondered if he had known something like this could happen.

The cabin was falling apart. Not physically the structure was still standing, barely but the illusion of safety it once held had been shattered, broken just like the window the wolves had crashed through.

Riley could still feel the weight of Callum's warning, his voice replaying in her mind:

"You don't belong in this world, Riley Hayes. But if you insist on staying, Callum is more than happy to rip you apart."

She hated the way his words lingered, slithering under her skin like poison.

They needed to move now.

She turned away from Kieran, her pulse hammering as she grabbed the old backpack from the closet. Her fingers shook slightly as she pulled open drawers, stuffing whatever supplies she could find inside. Water bottles, a first-aid kit, a flashlight, extra clothes anything that might help them survive out there.

Nova, finally pulling herself together, walked over and leaned against the wall, watching Riley pack. "So, just to clarify, we're running again?"

"We're regrouping," Kieran corrected, though he sounded as exhausted as he looked.

Nova snorted. "Sure. Because that sounds way more badass than fleeing for our lives."

Riley shot her a glare before zipping the bag shut. "Would you rather stay here and wait for the pack to burn this place to the ground?"

Nova lifted her hands in surrender. "Nope. Just making sure we all understand how much our lives suck right now."

Kieran exhaled sharply. "Not for long."

Something in his tone sent a chill down Riley's spine.

Determination.

Vengeance.

Whatever Kieran was planning, it wasn't just about survival anymore.

She wanted to ask him what he meant and what exactly he intended to do but there wasn't time for more questions with no answers.

She slung the backpack over her shoulder. "We need to get moving."

Kieran nodded, but when he took a step forward, his body swayed slightly. Riley instinctively reached out, steadying him with a hand on his arm.

He stiffened under her touch, golden eyes flicking to hers.

"I'm fine," he muttered.

Riley raised a brow. "Yeah. That's why you almost fell on your face."

Kieran scowled. "I've been through worse."

"Not with wounds that aren't healing."

Silence.

Riley felt his arm tense beneath her fingers. He wasn't used to being vulnerable, wasn't used to needing help. But she wasn't going to let him do this alone.

Whether he liked it or not.

Nova, clearly done with their little moment, groaned. "Ugh. Can you two not flirt while we're being actively hunted?"

Riley immediately dropped her hand and took a step back, ignoring the heat rising to her face. "We're not"

Nova rolled her eyes. "Yeah, yeah. Save it for after we survive."

Kieran let out a low chuckle, shaking his head.

Riley scowled. Unbelievable.

"Let's go," she muttered, stalking toward the door before Nova could make any more annoying comments.

The cold air hit her as soon as she stepped outside. The scent of pine and damp earth filled her lungs, but beneath it, she could still smell the wolves.

They weren't here anymore.

But they had been.

And they would be back.

Kieran stepped up beside her, his gaze scanning the tree line. "Stay close."

She didn't argue.

Because for the first time, she realized she wasn't just running from the pack anymore.

She was running from whatever she was becoming.

And she had no idea if she could outrun it.
###chapter 7: The Hunt Begins
The night was too quiet.

Riley felt it in her bones and the wrongness of the silence pressing in around them. The cold bite of the wind should have carried the usual sounds of the forest, the rustle of leaves, the distant hoot of an owl, and the chirp of unseen insects. But there was nothing. Just the crunch of their footsteps against the damp earth and the slow, steady beat of her pulse hammering in her ears.

They were being hunted.

She didn't know how she knew it only that the feeling slithered under her skin, coiling tight in her chest.

Kieran walked ahead of her, his posture tense, golden eyes scanning the darkness like he expected an attack at any second. Nova followed closely behind, muttering curses under her breath every time a twig snapped beneath her boots. The backpack Riley had packed earlier was slung over her shoulders, heavier than she remembered, though maybe that was just the exhaustion settling into her bones.

"Where exactly is this friend of yours?" Nova asked, voice hushed.

"Not far," Kieran answered.

"Yeah, super specific. Love that for us," she muttered.

Riley shot her a look before glancing at Kieran. His jaw was clenched tight, his knuckles white where he gripped his injured side. He was still bleeding, though he was trying to hide it. The scent of his blood mixed with the pine-heavy air, sharp and metallic, and Riley hated the way it unsettled her.

They needed to move faster.

"We should pick up the pace," she said. "We don't know how long we have before they track us."

Kieran didn't argue, but the flicker of pain in his expression told her more than words ever could. He wasn't okay. The wound should have closed hours ago, but it hadn't, and Riley knew why.

The mark.

She hadn't let herself think about it too much, not with everything else happening but now, as she watched Kieran struggle to stay upright, the reality of what had happened between them pressed down on her like a weight. He had marked her. Even if it had been an accident, even if neither of them fully understood what it meant, it had changed something.

And that something was killing him.

"How much further?" she asked, forcing the thought aside.

Kieran exhaled sharply. "There's an old hunting cabin near the edge of the ridge. If we can make it there before sunrise, we'll be safe for a few hours."

Riley nodded, but Nova groaned. "Great. Another cabin. Because the last one worked out so well for us."

"Do you have a better idea?"

Nova scowled but didn't answer.

They kept moving. The trees stretched high above them, skeletal shadows against the dark sky. The moon had long

The trees stretched high above them, skeletal shadows against the dark sky. The moon had long since disappeared behind thick clouds, plunging the forest into near-total darkness. Riley kept her steps light, ears straining for any sign that they weren't alone.

Beside her, Kieran moved with a quiet grace that shouldn't have been possible given how much blood he'd lost. His golden eyes flickered in the dim light, sharp and alert, scanning the woods like he could sense something she couldn't.

Riley wasn't sure if that made her feel better or worse.

Nova, on the other hand, was not built for stealth. She stumbled over a root, barely catching herself before face-planting into the dirt.

"Dammit," she hissed, brushing dirt from her hands. "Why is everything in this stupid forest out to kill me?"

Kieran gave her a dry look. "If the forest wanted you dead, you'd already be dead."

Nova's glare could have melted steel. "Wow. Thanks for that comforting thought, wolf boy."

Riley sighed, glancing at Kieran. "Is this friend of yours expecting us, or are we just showing up and hoping they don't shoot first and ask questions later?"

Kieran hesitated. Just for a second. But it was enough.

Nova groaned. "Oh, you have got to be kidding me. They don't even know we're coming?"

"They'll help," Kieran said simply, pushing forward through the trees.

Nova muttered something that sounded suspiciously like, You'd better hope so, or we're all screwed.

Riley tightened her grip on the backpack strap slung over her shoulder, her stomach twisting uneasily. Kieran might have been confident, but she wasn't sure she shared that confidence. If this person was anything like the rest of the werewolves she'd encountered so far, they weren't exactly going to be thrilled to see her.

The feeling of being watched only grew stronger the farther they went.

The hair on the back of Riley's neck stood up. She slowed her pace, glancing over her shoulder, but the forest was empty. No movement. No sound. Just the endless stretch of trees disappearing into the darkness.

But something was there. She could feel it.

And then

A twig snapped.

Riley barely had time to react before Kieran moved.

One second he was beside her, the next he was in front of her, body tense, shoulders squared. His hands curled into fists at his sides, golden eyes glowing in the dark.

Nova froze, her breath hitching.

The silence was deafening.

Then

A low, guttural growl rumbled through the trees.

Riley's blood ran cold.

They weren't alone.

And whoever was out there wasn't friendly.

Kieran shifted his stance slightly, weight balanced, every muscle in his body coiled tight like a predator ready to strike. His breathing was even, and controlled, but Riley could feel the tension rolling off him in waves.

And then, a voice broke the silence.

"Well, well. Look what we have here."

A shadow stepped forward from the trees.

Tall. Broad-shouldered. Smirking like they'd already won.

Riley's stomach dropped.

Because she knew exactly who it was.

Callum.

Callum's smirk widened as he stepped into the faint moonlight filtering through the trees. His dark hair was tousled like he hadn't bothered fixing it after shifting, and his sharp features were cast in eerie half-shadows. But it was his eyes that sent a chill through Riley's bones cold, calculating, and glowing with predatory amusement.

Behind him, two other wolves emerged from the darkness, their expressions unreadable, their presence radiating quiet menace.

Trapped.

Riley's fingers curled into fists at her sides, pulse hammering as Callum's gaze flicked between her and Kieran, amusement dancing in his golden eyes.

"Didn't take you long to run," Callum said, tilting his head. "I thought rogues were supposed to be tougher than this."

Kieran didn't move. He stood completely still, muscles taut, but Riley could see the strain in his posture. He was still injured. Still bleeding. And Callum knew it.

"Walk away," Kieran said, his voice low and even.

Callum chuckled. "Why would I do that? This is the most fun I've had in weeks."

Nova made a noise in the back of her throat. "Wow. Your definition of fun is seriously messed up."

Callum ignored her, taking a slow step forward, his eyes locked on Riley now.

And suddenly, she realized what he was doing.

He wasn't here for Kieran.

He was here for her.

A cold weight settled in her stomach.

"You don't belong in this world, Riley Hayes," Callum said, voice smooth like silk over a blade. "But you're here anyway. So tell me how you think this ends for you?"

Riley forced herself to hold his gaze, even as every instinct in her body screamed at her to run.

"I don't know," she said, lifting her chin. "Why don't you tell me?"

Callum's smirk sharpened. "Gladly."

And then he moved.

Fast. Too fast.

Riley barely had time to register the blur of motion before Kieran was suddenly in front of her, intercepting Callum's attack with a force that sent both of them crashing into the trees.

Snarls filled the air, fangs flashing, bodies colliding.

The other wolves lunged forward one going for Nova, the other straight for Riley.

Riley dodged on instinct, heart slamming against her ribs. She wasn't a fighter she knew that but she wasn't about to just stand there and get torn apart either.

Nova ducked under a swipe of claws, kicking out at her attacker's leg with a sharp crack. "Okay, this sucks!" she shouted, narrowly avoiding another hit.

Riley barely heard her.

Because the second wolf, the one who had locked onto her, was circling now, slow and deliberate. Testing her.

Waiting for her to slip.

Her breath came fast and shallow. She had no weapon. No real training. But something inside her burned something hot and unfamiliar, curling through her veins like wildfire.

She felt it before she understood it.

The wolf lunged.

And suddenly, Riley moved.

Faster than she should have. Faster than she'd ever moved before.

Her body twisted out of the way, reacting on instinct she shouldn't have, and before she could think, before she could even question, she had her hand wrapped around the wolf's wrist and twisted.

A snap. A howl.

The wolf staggered back, clutching its broken arm, eyes wide with shock.

Riley froze.

What the hell just happened?

Callum's laughter cut through the chaos.

"Oh," he said, breathless and delighted. "That is interesting."

Riley's heart slammed against her ribs, her hand still tingling with the impossible strength she had just used.

Because of that speed, that power

It wasn't normal.

And Callum had just seen it.

His smirk deepened.

"This just got so much more fun."
###chapter 8: The Edge of Control
The world had narrowed to the violent rhythm of breathing, the snapping of branches, and the suffocating tension between predator and prey.

Riley wasn't sure which one she was anymore.

Her fingers still tingled from where she had struck the wolf, from where she had twisted his wrist too hard too easily. She shouldn't have been able to do that. Shouldn't have been able to move that fast, react that quickly. And yet, she had.

And Callum had seen it.

The amusement in his golden eyes sent a fresh wave of panic rolling through her, but she shoved it down. Now was not the time to fall apart.

Kieran and Callum were still locked in a brutal fight just beyond the tree line, snapping jaws and flashing claws moving too fast for her human eyes except you're not just human, are you? to track.

Nova had managed to slam the other wolf into the ground and was scrambling to keep him down. "A little help would be great!" she yelled, dodging as he lashed out.

Riley took a half-step forward, but Callum's low voice cut through the chaos.

"Don't stop now, Riley."

She went rigid.

He was looking at her, not Kieran. Not Nova. Her.

Callum's smirk was slow and knowing as he took a measured step closer, ignoring Kieran's snarl of warning. "That was impressive. Very impressive."

Riley's pulse pounded against her ribs. "I don't know what you're talking about."

He chuckled. "You're a terrible liar."

Riley's hands clenched into fists.

She didn't want his attention. Didn't want the sick satisfaction in his expression or the way he was looking at her like she was something new to hunt.

But she also couldn't deny what had just happened.

Kieran threw off Callum's next attack with a snarl, shoving him back hard enough to send him skidding through the dirt. "Back off, Callum," he growled, fangs flashing in the moonlight.

Callum didn't even look at him. His gaze remained locked on Riley, burning with something dangerous and interesting.

"I wonder," he mused, tapping a finger against his chin, "how long you've known."

"Known what?" she snapped, even though dread curled in her stomach like a living thing.

Callum tilted his head. "That you're not just some fragile little human caught in the wrong place at the wrong time."

Riley's blood turned to ice.

Kieran moved before she could, launching himself at Callum with a ferocity she had never seen before. Their bodies slammed together, rolling through the underbrush in a blur of teeth and claws.

Nova finally managed to knock out her attacker with a well-placed strike to the head, but she barely had time to gloat before Riley grabbed her wrist and yanked her backward. "We have to go," Riley said, heart hammering.

Nova's eyes flicked toward Kieran and Callum, then back to Riley. "We can't just"

"I know," Riley cut in. "But if we stay, we're dead."

Nova cursed under her breath but nodded, grabbing the nearest heavy branch like she meant to use it. "Lead the way."

Riley hesitated just a second longer before calling out, "Kieran!"

He didn't stop fighting, but his gaze snapped to hers for the briefest second.

She hoped he understood what she was about to do.

Then she grabbed Nova's arm and ran.

The forest was a blur of shadows and moonlight as Riley ran, her breath coming in sharp bursts. Nova was right behind her, cursing under her breath, but Riley couldn't afford to slow down. Not when the howls were closing in.

The moment Callum had looked at her looked at her she'd known she had to get out. There was something too sharp, too calculating in his gaze, and she wasn't about to wait around to find out what he was thinking.

Kieran had barely given her a nod before she turned and fled, knowing that he'd keep Callum distracted long enough for them to escape.

But running wasn't enough. Not this time.

Her body felt wrong, her muscles thrumming with energy she didn't understand. She wasn't supposed to be this fast. She shouldn't have been able to break that wolf's wrist so easily. But somehow, she had. And worse, Callum had noticed.

The road appeared ahead, a thin strip of asphalt cutting through the dense forest. A flash of headlights in the distance sent a fresh surge of hope through her chest.

"There!" she gasped, pointing.

Nova didn't hesitate. They sprinted the last few feet, breaking through the treeline just as the sound of pursuit crashed through the woods behind them.

A dark shape lunged from the shadows.

Riley barely had time to react before she was shoving Nova out of the way, twisting to avoid the set of claws swiping toward her. The wolf landed where she'd just been standing, snarling as it spun to face her again.

Her stomach clenched.

This one was bigger than the others.

"Somewhere safe," Kieran said, his voice rough.

Riley wasn't sure she believed him.

The car's interior was filled with the scent of blood his blood. It soaked through his shirt, a stark contrast against his pale skin, and every time he exhaled, Riley swore she could hear the slight hitch of pain he was trying to hide.

"You're still bleeding," she said, her voice quieter than she meant it to be.

"I noticed," Kieran muttered.

Riley exchanged a glance with Nova, who raised an eyebrow as if to say Are you gonna push this, or should I?

Nova didn't wait for an answer. "Okay, not to be the voice of reason, but maybe we should not ignore the fact that Kieran is dying in the driver's seat."

"I'm not dying," Kieran said, but the way he tightened his grip on the wheel made Riley think otherwise.

"Right, sure," Nova said, voice dripping with sarcasm. "Because losing that much blood is normal. Super casual."

Riley didn't argue. Instead, she reached forward, pressing a careful hand against his arm. "Kieran," she said, softer now, "you need to let me look at it."

"I'll be fine," he said, but his voice lacked conviction.

The car hit a pothole, jolting them all. Kieran sucked in a sharp breath, his hands briefly jerking on the wheel before he steadied it. That was all the confirmation Riley needed.

"We need to stop," she insisted.

Kieran clenched his jaw, but after a long moment, he let out a slow breath. "There's a place a few miles from here," he admitted. "We can stop there."

Riley let herself relax, just a little.

The car sped down the winding road, cutting through the darkness like a ghost. Riley kept her eyes on the side mirror, watching for any sign of pursuit, but so far, nothing.

Still, the unease in her chest refused to fade.

Callum had seen what she'd done back there. Felt it. And the way he had looked at her like she was some puzzle waiting to be solved sent a cold shiver down her spine.

She didn't understand what was happening to her.

But Callum did.

And that terrified her.

The safe house was less of a house and more of a run-down shack in the middle of nowhere. The moment Kieran pulled up, Riley felt her stomach twist.

"This is it?" Nova asked flatly, staring at the weathered wooden structure like it personally offended her.

"It's off the grid," Kieran said, already moving to open the door.

The moment he stood, he staggered.

Riley was out of the car before she could think, her hands gripping his arm to steady him. His skin was too warm beneath her touch, feverish.

"Kieran"

"I'm fine."

"You keep saying that, and yet here we are."

Kieran exhaled heavily but didn't push her away. He let her help him toward the cabin, Nova trailing behind them, grumbling under her breath about tetanus and serial killer vibes.

Inside, the air was thick with dust, the scent of aged wood, and something vaguely metallic. It was a single-room space small, cramped, but functional. There was a tattered couch shoved against one wall, a tiny kitchen space with barely functioning appliances, and a cot in the corner.

Kieran collapsed onto the couch with a wince.

Riley immediately grabbed the first-aid kit she spotted near the sink, yanking it open as she knelt beside him. She peeled back his shirt, biting back a curse at the sight of his wound. It was deep. Jagged. Worse, it should have started healing by now.

But it wasn't.

Her stomach twisted. "Why isn't it closing?"

Kieran hesitated.

Nova crossed her arms. "Yeah, I'd like an answer to that too. You're a werewolf, right? Fast healing and all that?"

Kieran's gaze flicked to Riley.

She knew the answer before he said it.

"It's the mark, isn't it?" she whispered.

His silence was enough.

Riley pulled in a slow breath, her pulse hammering against her ribs. She had suspected it, but hearing the confirmation made it real. Too real.

"What does it mean?" she asked.

Kieran's golden eyes searched hers, something unreadable flickering in their depths. "It means," he said, voice quieter now, "that we don't have time to figure it out. Because if it's affecting me"

His gaze lingered on her.

A shiver crawled down Riley's spine.

He didn't have to say it.

If the mark was doing this to him, what the hell was it doing to her?

Riley barely slept that night.

Nova had passed out on the cot, muttering something about how if she was gonna die, she might as well be well-rested, but Riley hadn't been able to close her eyes.

Instead, she sat on the floor near the couch, her arms wrapped around her knees, listening to the steady rhythm of Kieran's breathing.

She wasn't sure when she had started watching over him.

At some point, his breaths had turned heavier, and slower, his body sinking deeper into exhaustion. And despite everything, despite the lingering tension between them, despite the weight of the unknown pressing down on her chest she had stayed.

Maybe it was guilt. Maybe it was something else.

But when Kieran shifted slightly, his breathing hitching like he was on the verge of waking, Riley didn't move away.

Didn't let go.

Even as she felt something inside her shifting, unraveling.

Because for the first time, she wasn't sure she wanted to.
###chapter 9: The Hunger Within 
Riley woke to the sound of her ragged breathing.

For a moment, she wasn't sure where she was. Her heart pounded, her skin damp with sweat, and the world around her felt wrong. Too sharp. Too loud.

The faint crackle of the old cabin settling against the wind sent a ripple of awareness down her spine. She could hear Nova's slow, steady breathing from the cot. The rustling of fabric as Kieran shifted on the couch. The distant howl of something far beyond the trees, its eerie call vibrating through her bones.

Her senses were too sharp.

Too alive.

She pressed a hand against her chest, willing her pulse to slow, but it was useless.

Something was changing.

The room smelled like dust and old wood, but underneath it, she could pick out the distinct scent of Kieran's blood. It filled her nose, thick and metallic, sparking something inside her that she did not want to acknowledge.

Panic flared.

She scrambled to her feet, moving too fast, too smoothly. Her body felt weightless, yet coiled tight like she was seconds from springing forward. The movement sent a fresh wave of dizziness through her skull.

She needed air.

Without thinking, she pushed the door open and stepped outside.

The night was cold against her overheated skin, but the chill did little to ground her. The forest stretched before her, dark and endless, but instead of fear, all she felt was hunger.

Not for food.

Not for anything she could name.

Her fingers curled, nails pressing into her palms as she sucked in a sharp breath. Everything felt too much. The wind whispered through the trees, carrying scents she shouldn't have been able to distinguish. The damp earth. The faint traces of other animals in the distance. The lingering scent of wolves in the air.

Her stomach twisted.

What was happening to her?

A rustle behind her made her stiffen.

She turned sharply, muscles tensing, only to find Kieran watching her from the doorway.

He looked worse than before. His skin was pale, almost too pale, and even in the dim light

Riley nodded slowly, unsure how to put into words what was happening to her because she wasn't even sure what it was. How was she supposed to explain the way her body felt too wired, too aware, too wrong?

Kieran stepped forward, moving with the quiet grace of a predator, but she noticed how he swayed slightly, how his fingers clenched around the doorframe like he needed the support.

"You shouldn't be up," she said, crossing her arms over her chest.

A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth. "Funny. I was about to say the same to you."

She scowled but didn't argue.

Kieran studied her for a long moment, his golden eyes scanning her like he was seeing something she couldn't. Then, softly, he asked, "You felt it, didn't you?"

Riley stiffened.

She wanted to lie. To say she was fine, that nothing was wrong, that she had just needed air.

But she couldn't.

Because she had felt it.

That strange, unnatural energy pulsing through her veins, the way her senses had sharpened, the hunger curling deep inside her like a beast waiting to be set free.

"What's happening to me?" she whispered.

Kieran exhaled, his smirk fading. "I don't know."

That terrified her more than anything.

Kieran always seemed to have the answers. He understood this world in a way she didn't, and if he didn't know what was happening to her, then what hope did she have?

Her chest tightened.

"I think it's the mark," he admitted, voice lower now, like he wasn't sure he wanted to say the words out loud. "It's changing you."

Riley shivered. "Into what?"

Kieran didn't answer right away. His gaze flickered to the trees, his expression unreadable. "That's what we need to find out."

Riley turned away, running a hand through her hair. The night stretched before them, dark and endless, and for the first time, she felt something calling to her from the woods. Something she couldn't name.

It scared her.

And worse

It excited her.

She shook the thought away and forced herself to focus. "You said we were going to see a friend. Someone who could help."

Kieran nodded. "Yeah. But we'll have to leave at first light."

"Why not now?"

"Because we're already being hunted," Kieran said grimly. "And traveling at night makes it easier for them to track us."

Riley swallowed hard. She hated how logical that was.

Kieran watched her, his golden eyes flickering in the moonlight. "Try to get some rest, Riley."

She wasn't sure she could.

But she nodded anyway, stepping back toward the cabin. She could feel Kieran's gaze on her as she disappeared inside, the weight of unspoken things hanging between them.

Something was changing inside her.

And she wasn't sure if she should fight it

Or let it take over.

Riley lay on the worn-out couch, staring at the ceiling, but sleep refused to come.

Her entire body felt restless like energy was thrumming beneath her skin, refusing to settle. Every creak of the cabin, every gust of wind against the wooden walls, made her muscles tighten as if she were waiting for some unseen danger to lunge from the shadows.

She squeezed her eyes shut, forcing herself to take slow, steady breaths.

Kieran had said the mark was changing her.

But what?

Her stomach twisted.

She thought back to the way she had moved in the woods, the way she had felt the presence of the wolves before seeing them, the unnatural speed that had carried her away from Callum's attack.

No human should be able to do that.

A sharp pain bloomed behind her ribs, making her suck in a breath. It wasn't like the usual aches of exhaustion or injury, it was deeper like something inside her was stretching, shifting, awakening.

She pressed a hand to her chest, swallowing hard.

This isn't normal.

Footsteps.

Riley's eyes snapped open.

For a moment, she thought she had imagined it. But then she heard it again, the faint sound of movement just outside the cabin. Slow. Purposeful.

She sat up carefully, every nerve in her body suddenly alert.

Nova was still asleep on the cot, her breathing slow and even. Kieran was slumped in the chair near the door, his body tense even in unconsciousness.

Whoever was outside wasn't one of them.

Riley moved without thinking, slipping off the couch as quietly as possible. Her heart pounded in her chest as she crept toward the window, carefully pulling back the curtain just enough to see outside.

The forest stretched into darkness, thick and unmoving. But the feeling of being watched pressed against her skin, making the hair on the back of her neck rise.

Something was out there.

She turned toward Kieran, about to wake him, but before she could speak

The door burst open.

A dark figure lunged inside, moving impossibly fast.

Riley barely had time to react before a heavy weight slammed into her, knocking her to the floor. A hand clamped around her throat, pinning her down. She gasped, struggling, but the grip was like iron.

Golden eyes gleamed above her.

Not Kieran's.

Callum.

"Did you really think you could run from me?" he whispered, his grip tightening just enough to make her pulse spike with panic.

A low growl rumbled from across the room.

Then Kieran was moving.

He collided with Callum in a blur of motion, ripping him away from Riley and slamming him into the wooden wall with enough force to crack the old boards. Callum snarled but barely looked winded, his smirk sharp as ever.

"Missed me, Wolfe?" he taunted.

Kieran didn't hesitate. He lunged again, this time aiming to kill.

The cabin exploded into chaos.

Riley scrambled backward, her breath coming fast as Kieran and Callum tore into each other with savage intensity. Claws flashed, fists landed with sickening thuds, and the scent of blood filled the air.

Callum was toying with Kieran. That much was clear. He was too fast and every time Kieran tried to land a decisive blow, Callum dodged at the last second, laughing like this was all just a game.

A blur of movement to Riley's left caught her attention.

One of Callum's wolves, bigger than the others she had seen before, his face twisted in a vicious snarl, was charging straight for Nova.

Riley moved.

She didn't think. She didn't hesitate.

One second she was crouched near the floor, the next she was launching herself forward, intercepting the wolf before he could reach Nova's sleeping form.

Her body reacted on pure instinct.

She grabbed the wolf by the arm and threw him.

Not pushed. Not shoved.

Threw.

The massive wolf hit the opposite wall so hard that the wooden panels cracked on impact. He slumped to the floor, groaning, his eyes wide with shock.

Riley froze.

Her breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

She looked down at her hands, at her fingers that had moved with unnatural strength, at the way her body had reacted without hesitation.

That wasn't normal.

That wasn't human.

Callum's laughter cut through the chaos.

"Oh, that's interesting," he mused, dodging another strike from Kieran with infuriating ease. His golden eyes flicked toward Riley, full of something dark and knowing. "Looks like someone's finally waking up."

Riley's stomach dropped.

She didn't have time to process what he meant, because, at that moment, Nova woke up.

She sat up, groggy and disoriented, her eyes widening as she took in the destruction around her. "What the hell"

The wolf Riley had thrown suddenly surged forward again.

Riley reacted instantly.

She spun, moving faster than she should have been able to, grabbing the wolf's wrist mid-strike and twisting hard. A sickening crack echoed through the cabin as he howled in pain, collapsing to his knees.

Her breathing was ragged, her heart hammering, but she barely felt the exhaustion.

She felt alive.

Powerful.

Wrong.

Callum was watching her like a predator who had just caught the scent of something rare and valuable.

"Now that," he murmured, stepping back toward the open door, "is something worth chasing."

Kieran lunged at him again, but Callum was already moving. He ducked the attack with effortless ease, retreating toward the exit. His injured packmate scrambled after him, growling in pain.

Callum smirked. "We'll be seeing each other again soon, Riley."

Then, before Kieran could reach him, he was gone.

The silence that followed was deafening.

Riley was still breathing hard, her entire body trembling.

Nova was staring at her. Not at Kieran. Her.

"What the hell was that?" Nova whispered.

Riley didn't have an answer.

Kieran turned toward her, his golden eyes unreadable. "We need to go," he said, voice tight. "Now."

Riley swallowed hard, her fingers still shaking.

She had known something was changing.

But after tonight after what she had just done

She wasn't sure if she wanted to know what she was becoming.
###chapter 10: The Monster Within
Riley's hands wouldn't stop shaking.

Even as they ran through the dense forest, Kieran leading the way with sharp, determined strides, Nova cursing under her breath behind her, the tremors wouldn't stop.

She could still feel the echo of that moment, the power that had surged through her, the unnatural speed, the raw, brutal strength that had let her take down a wolf twice her size. It should have been impossible. She wasn't a werewolf. She wasn't anything.

Except now she wasn't so sure.

The cold air burned in her lungs as she forced herself to focus. One foot in front of the other. Keep moving. Don't think about the fact that Callum had seen everything.

Don't think about the way he had looked at her.

"We can't stop," Kieran called over his shoulder, his voice tight. "They won't be far behind."

Riley swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded, pushing herself to keep pace.

The night stretched around them, shadows weaving through the trees. The safe house was no longer an option not after Callum had found them so easily. They needed a new plan, a new place to hide.

Kieran had said there was someone who could help.

She just hoped they got there before it was too late.

Nova let out a frustrated breath. "Can someone please explain what the hell just happened back there? Because I feel like I missed a pretty big memo."

No one answered.

Kieran's jaw was clenched, his focus locked on the path ahead.

Riley wasn't sure she could answer.

Because she didn't know.

Her thoughts kept looping back to the moment she had moved, the moment instinct had taken over. It hadn't just been speed. It had precision. She knew exactly where to strike, how to move, how to disable her opponent.

That wasn't human.

That was a predator.

Her stomach twisted.

This wasn't the first time something had felt off inside her, not really. She had ignored the signs, and brushed them off as adrenaline, as coincidence. But now, after Callum's knowing smirk, after the way Kieran had looked at her when she threw that wolf-like, he weighed nothing

She couldn't ignore it anymore.

They ran for what felt like hours, cutting through the forest, across rivers, over uneven terrain. Kieran never slowed, even as the faintest hints of dawn crept over the horizon, turning the sky a deep indigo.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Kieran came to an abrupt stop at the edge of a rocky incline. Below them, a cabin sat nestled between the trees, its roof covered in moss, the wooden walls weathered but sturdy.

Riley's pulse pounded.

"Who lives here?" she asked, breathless.

Kieran hesitated.

Then, voice low, he said, "Someone who knows what you are."

Riley's blood ran cold.

Nova let out a strangled laugh. "Okay. Great. Because that's not creepy at all."

Kieran didn't respond. Instead, he started down the incline, his movements careful but steady. Riley followed, her mind racing.

Whoever this was, whoever Kieran was bringing her to know something.

About her.

And for the first time, she wasn't sure she wanted to hear the truth.

The cabin was eerily quiet when they stepped inside.

Dust floated in the golden slivers of light filtering through the cracks in the wooden walls. The scent of herbs, old books, and something vaguely metallic filled the air. A fire burned low in the hearth, casting flickering shadows along the floor.

And then, from the back of the room

"So, you finally brought her."

Riley stiffened.

A woman stepped out of the shadows, her movements smooth, almost too deliberate. She looked older, but not old, maybe in her early forties, her dark hair streaked with silver, her features sharp and unreadable. Her piercing green eyes locked onto Riley with unnerving focus.

Kieran tensed. "Elena."

Elena crossed her arms, unimpressed. "Took you long enough."

Nova shot Riley a sideways glance. "Who is this?"

Before Kieran could answer, Elena spoke again. "The one person who can tell Riley what she is."

Riley's heart stopped.

She forced herself to stay calm, to steady her breath. "And what exactly am I?" she asked, her voice sharper than she intended.

Elena studied her for a long moment. Then she gestured to the worn-out couch near the fireplace. "Sit."

Riley didn't move.

Elena arched her brow. "Do you want answers or not?"

Riley exchanged a glance with Kieran, but he just nodded, his expression unreadable.

Fine.

She sat. Nova hovered near the doorway, arms crossed, looking like she was ready to bolt at the first sign of trouble.

Elena walked to the fire, stirring the embers with an iron poker before turning back to Riley. "Tell me," she said. "How long have you felt it?"

Riley hesitated. "Felt what?"

"The pull. The strength. The hunger."

A cold shiver crawled down Riley's spine.

"I don't know what you're talking about," she lied.

Elena's lips twitched in something that wasn't quite a smile. "Yes, you do."

Riley clenched her jaw. "Just tell me what's happening to me."

Elena was silent for a long moment. Then she exhaled and said, "You were never meant to be just human."

The words hit like a hammer.

Riley's fingers curled into fists. "That's not possible."

Elena tilted her head slightly. "Isn't it?"

Riley shook her head. "No. I don't shift. I don't have a pack. I don't"

"You don't shift because you were never meant to," Elena interrupted. "And as for a pack?" Her green eyes gleamed. "That's a little more complicated."

Riley felt like the air had been sucked from the room.

Her pulse roared in her ears, her thoughts racing too fast to catch.

"What are you saying?" she whispered.

Elena walked closer, crouching down until she was at eye level with Riley. When she spoke, her voice was quiet.

"I'm saying, Riley Hayes, that you are neither human nor wolf."

Silence.

Riley's skin felt like it was burning, her breath coming too fast. "Then what am I?"

Elena's expression turned solemn. "You are something much older. Much rarer."

Riley shook her head. "No. That doesn't make any sense. My parents were"

"Your father was human," Elena said. "But your mother? She wasn't."

Riley's world tilted on its axis.

No.

No, that wasn't possible.

Her mother had died. She had been normal. There had never been anything

"Stop lying," Riley snapped, pushing to her feet. "My mother wasn't"

"She was," Elena said simply. "But not in the way you think."

The fire crackled, casting shifting light across Elena's face.

"She was feral."

The words sent a shockwave through Riley's chest.

She had heard that term before. Feral wolves, ones who weren't part of a pack, weren't bound by the same rules and weren't entirely in control of themselves. They were the monsters of the werewolf world, the ones even Alphas feared.

They weren't supposed to exist.

And yet, here Elena was, telling her that her mother had been one of them.

Riley's breath came fast, her mind racing. "That's not"

"It is true," Elena said. "And you're starting to feel it, aren't you?"

Riley's throat went dry.

The strength. The hunger. The wrongness curled inside her.

She squeezed her eyes shut.

No.

No, she wasn't like that.

She couldn't be.

But she knew.

Deep down, she knew.

Elena's voice softened. "You don't have to be afraid of it."

Riley opened her eyes, meeting Elena's steady gaze.

She was afraid.

Because whatever was happening to her

It was only just beginning.

Riley took a slow, shaky step back. The floor beneath her felt uneven like the world itself had shifted under her feet.

"No," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "That's not possible."

Elena didn't flinch. "You can deny it all you want, but you've felt it, haven't you? The pull. The power. The way your body reacts before you even think."

Riley's breath came fast. "I'm not like them."

"You're not like anyone," Elena corrected. "You're something different. Something dangerous."

The fire crackled in the hearth, but Riley barely heard it over the roaring in her ears.

This wasn't real. It couldn't be real.

She turned sharply toward Kieran. "You knew."

Kieran met her gaze, his expression unreadable. "I suspected."

Her stomach twisted. "And you didn't tell me?"

"I wasn't sure," he said, his voice quieter now. "Not until Callum saw it too."

Callum.

Riley's heart slammed against her ribs.

He had known.

The way he had looked at her after she took down his wolf. The amusement, the curiosity, the delight.

Because he recognized what she was.

And now, she understood why.

Her hands curled into fists. "So what does this mean?" she asked, turning back to Elena. "Am I supposed to just what? Accept this?"

Elena studied her for a long moment. "That depends."

"On what?" Riley demanded.

Elena's gaze darkened. "On whether you can control it before it controls you."

The words settled over the room like a thick fog.

Nova, who had been silent until now, exhaled sharply. "Okay. So just to be clear Riley is, like, half-werewolf, half something else?"

"She's not half anything," Elena corrected. "She's feral."

Nova's eyebrows shot up. "That sounds bad."

Riley could feel her pulse pounding in her throat.

"Bad?" she repeated. "You think this is bad?" She let out a sharp, humorless laugh. "I don't even know what I am, and now you're telling me I have to control something I don't understand?"

Elena's expression didn't change. "Yes."

Riley let out a ragged breath, running a hand through her hair. "And if I can't?"

For the first time, Elena hesitated.

Then, quietly, she said, "Then you become what the packs fear most."

Silence.

Nova shifted uncomfortably. "Awesome. Love that for us."

Riley felt like she couldn't breathe.

Her entire life, she had thought she was normal. Even after finding out about werewolves, even after Kieran, she had never considered that she might be something else entirely.

Something that didn't belong anywhere.

She swallowed hard. "So what do I do?"

Elena studied her carefully, then nodded toward the door. "Come with me."

Riley hesitated, but when Kieran gave her a small nod of silent encouragement she forced herself to move.

Whatever this was, whatever she was becoming

She needed to know the truth.

Even if she wasn't ready for it.
###chapter 11: The Truth Beneath the Skin
The night air was crisp and biting as Riley stepped out of the cabin. The sky above was still deep with the remnants of night, though hints of dawn bled across the horizon in streaks of gray and violet. She shivered, but not from the cold.

Elena walked ahead, her steps slow but deliberate, her presence commanding without effort. Kieran followed closely behind Riley, silent, watchful. Nova hesitated at the threshold, arms crossed.

"I swear, if this turns into some 'ancient ritual in the woods' thing, I'm out," Nova muttered under her breath.

Riley almost smiled, but the tension in her chest made it impossible.

Because despite everything despite the exhaustion in her bones, the fear coiled in her gut there was something else stirring inside her.

Something she didn't recognize.

Something that was waiting.

Elena led them down a narrow path through the trees, her movements unhurried, as if she wasn't guiding Riley toward something that could change everything.

Finally, they reached a clearing. The space was wide, ringed by towering pines, the ground damp from the night's lingering moisture. The air smelled of earth and something richer, something ancient.

Elena turned to face Riley, her green eyes sharp in the half-light. "Take off your shoes."

Riley blinked. "What?"

Elena exhaled, clearly expecting resistance. "You need to feel the ground beneath you. It'll help."

Nova scoffed. "Okay, this is getting ritual-y."

Kieran shot her a warning look, but Riley barely noticed.

She hesitated. Then, slowly, she slipped off her shoes, letting the damp grass press against her bare feet. The earth was cold, and grounding, but it didn't ease the tension winding through her muscles.

Elena watched her. "Now close your eyes."

Riley swallowed, her pulse fluttering. "Why?"

"Because I need you to stop thinking and start feeling," Elena said simply.

Riley clenched her jaw, but she obeyed.

The moment she closed her eyes, the world around her shifted.

The sounds of the forest became sharper the rustling of leaves, the distant hoot of an owl, the scurrying of something small beneath the underbrush.

The scent of pine and damp wood filled her lungs, but beneath it, she could pick out other scents, more distinct. Kieran earthy, warm, edged with the metallic bite of lingering blood. Nova is citrusy and sharp, laced with adrenaline.

And Elena

Riley's brow furrowed.

Elena smelled like nothing.

Or rather, she smelled like everything.

Her scent shifted wood smoke one second, something floral the next, then something deeper, richer, wilder. It was impossible to pin down.

"You feel it, don't you?" Elena's voice was quiet, coaxing.

Riley swallowed hard. "I"

A jolt of something shot through her, fast, unexpected. A flash of heat curled up her spine, burning beneath her ribs. She inhaled sharply, her hands twitching at her sides.

Her senses were too alive.

Too sharp.

And the worst part?

It felt good.

Riley's breathing quickened.

Something was changing inside her, stretching, waking up.

Her fingers twitched again, and she swore, for half a second, her nails felt longer.

She snapped her eyes open, her chest rising and falling rapidly. "What the hell was that?"

Elena watched her carefully. "That," she said, "was your instincts taking over."

Riley's stomach twisted. "That wasn't normal."

"No," Elena agreed. "It wasn't."

Silence stretched between them.

Nova shifted uncomfortably. "Okay, can someone please start explaining in full sentences instead of vague, cryptic nonsense?"

Elena's gaze never left Riley's. "Your body is adapting. Whether you want it to or not."

Riley clenched her jaw. "Adapting to what?"

"To what you are," Elena said simply. "To what you were always meant to be."

The words lodged in Riley's throat like a stone.

"I wasn't meant to be anything," she bit out.

Elena smiled, but it wasn't warm. "That's where you're wrong."

Riley's hands curled into fists at her sides. "I don't believe you."

Elena tilted her head slightly. "Then let me prove it."

She took a slow step back, giving Riley space. "Attack me."

Riley blinked. "What?"

"You heard me."

Riley shook her head. "I'm not"

"You can," Elena said. "And more than that? You want to."

A slow, icy feeling crept down Riley's spine.

Because the worst part was

Elena was right.

The heat beneath her skin, the sharpness in her senses, the way her body itched to move, to strike

It was there.

Waiting.

Elena smirked like she could see Riley's struggle. "Afraid you'll lose control?"

Riley grits her teeth. "No."

"Then prove it."

Riley took a step forward.

Kieran tensed, but he didn't stop her.

Nova muttered something under her breath, but Riley barely heard it.

She didn't know what she was doing. Didn't know what was about to happen.

But her body did.

Her muscles coiled, her pulse slowing not from fear, but from something else. Something focused. Something predatory.

She lunged.

Fast.

Faster than she should have been able to.

But Elena was faster.

She moved before Riley could reach her, twisting just out of reach, her movements too smooth, too practiced.

"Again," she said.

Riley growled in frustration and attacked again, this time feinting left before striking from the right.

Elena dodged easily.

"You're thinking too much," she said. "Stop trying to fight like a human."

Riley's breath came in sharp bursts. "I am human."

Elena's eyes gleamed. "Not anymore."

The words hit Riley like a shockwave.

Her vision blurred, her body burning from the inside out. Her pulse slammed against her ribs, but it wasn't panic. It wasn't fear.

It was hunger.

Not for food.

Not for anything human.

Elena moved again, too fast, to fluid, and something inside Riley snapped.

Her body reacted.

She spun without thinking, dropping low before surging up-fast, predatory, instinct taking over.

And this time

She struck.

Her fingers wrapped around Elena's wrist before the woman could fully dodge, and Riley twisted hard.

Elena's expression barely changed, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes approval.

Then, just as quickly, she yanked herself free and took a step back.

Riley was breathing too hard.

Her skin was too hot.

She looked down at her hands.

Her nails were longer. Sharper. Claws.

She gasped, stumbling back, staring at them in horror.

Nova swore under her breath. "Oh, hell no."

Riley felt sick.

This wasn't happening.

This couldn't be happening.

Elena gave her a slow nod. "There it is."

Riley sucked in a ragged breath, her hands still trembling. The claws were retracting, but too slowly, like her body was reluctant to let go of what had just happened.

She lifted her gaze to Elena, her vision swimming. "What's happening to me?"

Elena's expression was unreadable. "You're waking up."

A cold shiver crawled up Riley's spine.

"I don't want this," she whispered.

Elena sighed, crossing her arms. "That doesn't matter."

Kieran stepped forward, his voice tight. "She needs time."

Elena shot him a look. "She doesn't have time."

Riley barely heard them.

Her breathing was shallow, her body still too tense, her mind spinning.

Because she had felt it.

The power.

The hunger.

And the worst part?

For a split second

She liked it.

Riley backed away, her breath coming fast, the sharp tang of panic coating her tongue. She flexed her fingers, half-expecting the claws to reappear, but they had already retracted, leaving only the ghost of their presence behind.

This wasn't real.

It couldn't be real.

She was just a girl. A normal girl.

Except she wasn't.

And deep down, she had always known something wasn't right.

"You're lying," she whispered.

Elena arched her brow. "Am I?"

Riley's jaw clenched. "I'm not I can't be"

"Feral?" Elena finished for her.

The word sent a fresh wave of nausea through Riley's gut.

Because that's what she was now, wasn't it? A thing of instinct. A thing of hunger.

A monster.

"No," she said, shaking her head, her voice barely holding steady. "No, I won't be like them."

Elena's expression didn't change. "That's up to you."

Something in the way she said it made Riley's pulse stutter.

She wanted to believe she had a choice, that she wasn't doomed to become one of the mindless creatures whispered about in werewolf legends.

But the way Elena looked at her steady, unshaken, like she had already seen what Riley would become sent cold dread pooling in her stomach.

Riley turned sharply to Kieran. "Tell me this isn't true."

Kieran hesitated.

That hesitation told her everything.

Her breath caught in her throat. "You knew."

Kieran's expression was tense, golden eyes dark with something unreadable. "I suspected."

A humorless laugh escaped her lips, sharp and bitter. "You suspected?"

"I didn't want to believe it," Kieran admitted, his voice low. "But Riley you felt it, didn't you?"

She had.

That was the worst part.

She had felt everything.

The power. The speed. The instinct that had taken over, guided her body before she even knew what she was doing.

It was terrifying.

And it felt right.

Riley sucked in a sharp breath, pressing her hands against her temples. Her thoughts were unraveling, spinning too fast for her to catch.

Elena spoke again, voice calm. "You don't have to lose yourself to it."

Riley lifted her gaze, her vision swimming. "But what if I do?"

Elena studied her for a long moment, then said, "Then there won't be anything left to save."

The words hit like a punch to the ribs.

Riley swallowed her throat tight.

Because despite everything despite the fear clawing at her chest, despite the truth settling into her bones like a weight she could never put down

A small, treacherous part of her already knew:

She wasn't the same girl she had been yesterday.

And she never would be again.
###chapter 12: A Line in the Sand
Riley didn't remember walking away from the clearing.

One moment, she had been standing in front of Elena, her mind spinning, her heart pounding. The next, she was deep in the woods, the damp scent of pine and earth filling her lungs.

She needed air.

She needed space.

Branches clawed at her arms as she pushed forward, her steps uneven, frantic. Her body felt too hot, her skin too tight, her thoughts tangled and suffocating.

Feral.

The word rang in her head like a curse, a brand she would never escape.

She stopped near the edge of a stream, bracing herself against a tree, her breath ragged. The water rushed over smooth stones, its soft babble a stark contrast to the chaos inside her.

This wasn't happening.

It couldn't be happening.

She had spent her entire life believing she was normal. Even when she had learned about werewolves, even when Kieran had come crashing into her life, she still clung to the idea that she was just Riley.

But that wasn't true, was it?

She wasn't just anything.

The proof was already there: the unnatural speed, the strength, the instincts that had saved her life back in the cabin. She had felt them growing stronger, stretching beneath her skin like something waiting to wake up.

And now, she knows why.

Her stomach twisted.

She didn't want this.

She didn't want to be one of them.

A rustle in the trees made her tense.

She turned sharply, every muscle in her body coiling tight, her breath catching in her throat.

Kieran stood a few feet away, watching her carefully.

Of course, he had followed her.

Of course, he had known she wouldn't stay.

"Riley."

She exhaled shakily, forcing herself to meet his gaze. "Don't."

Kieran hesitated but didn't move closer.

"You shouldn't be out here alone," he said after a beat.

Riley let out a humorless laugh. "Why? Afraid I might lose control?"

Kieran didn't answer right away. The silence stretched between them, thick and heavy.

Finally, he said, "I know this isn't easy."

Riley's fingers curled against the bark of the tree. "Easy?" she echoed. "Kieran, my entire life just got rewritten. Nothing about this is easy."

He nodded, but there was something guarded in his expression.

Something he wasn't saying.

Riley swallowed hard, her pulse pounding against her ribs.

"You knew," she said, her voice quieter now. "Didn't you?"

Kieran inhaled deeply, then nodded. "I suspected," he admitted. "But I didn't know for sure."

Her chest tightened. "And you didn't think to tell me?"

"I didn't have proof," he said, his golden eyes steady. "I didn't want to make you afraid of something that might not have been real."

"Well, guess what?" Riley let out a bitter laugh. "It's real. And now I don't have a choice."

She turned away from him, staring at the rushing water, willing it to drown out the roar of her thoughts.

Kieran stepped closer. "You do have a choice."

Riley clenched her jaw. "Do I?"

He hesitated. "You can learn to control it."

Her breath hitched. "And if I can't?"

Kieran didn't answer.

That silence told her everything.

Her hands tightened into fists.

She wanted to scream. To hit something. To tear this feeling out of her chest and throw it into the river.

Instead, she turned back to him, her voice sharp. "What aren't you telling me?"

Kieran's expression darkened.

"Elena said you don't have time," he said carefully. "She's right."

Riley frowned. "What do you mean?"

Kieran hesitated again. Then he exhaled slowly, his shoulders tight.

"Callum knows," he said. "And if he knows, the others will, too."

A cold weight settled in Riley's stomach.

"He's coming for me," she whispered.

Kieran's jaw clenched. "It's not just him. All of them will want to know what you are."

Riley swallowed hard. "And if they don't like the answer?"

Kieran's golden eyes burned. "Then they'll try to kill you."

The words hit like ice down her spine.

She knew it was bad. Had felt the weight of it in the way Callum had looked at her, the way Elena had spoken about control.

But hearing it out loud made it real.

Riley forced herself to stay steady. "So what do we do?"

Kieran hesitated again. "Elena can help. But it's not going to be easy."

Riley let out a sharp, hollow laugh. "Right. Because everything so far has been super easy."

Kieran gave her a look, but she wasn't in the mood for it.

She took a slow breath, pressing her fingers against her temples.

"So what? I just train until I magically fix whatever the hell is happening to me?"

Kieran's gaze flickered. "If you don't"

"I know," she snapped.

She knew what would happen if she lost control.

She had seen it in Kieran's face. In Elena's.

She would become something else.

Something the packs would hunt.

Something she wouldn't recognize.

Her stomach churned.

Kieran stepped closer. "You're not alone in this."

Riley exhaled, trying to ignore the warmth that spread through her at his words.

She wanted to believe him.

But deep down, she knew

Whatever was happening to her, whatever she was becoming

She was on her own.

Because no one could fight what was inside her.

No one except her.

Riley turned away from Kieran, staring at the dark water rushing past.

The weight of everything pressed down on her, suffocating, relentless. She wanted to scream. To punch something. To run.

But no matter how far she went, she knew the truth would follow.

Kieran was right.

Callum knew.

And if he knew, the others would too.

The packs would come for her, not just out of curiosity but out of fear.

She wasn't human. She wasn't a wolf.

She was something else.

Something dangerous.

Riley's hands clenched at her sides.

"Okay," she said finally, her voice tight but steady. "We train."

Kieran blinked. "What?"

Riley turned back to him, meeting his gaze. "I need to learn how to control this. Before it's too late."

Something flickered across his expression of relief, maybe. Or understanding.

"You will," he said.

Riley exhaled slowly, then nodded. "Then let's start now."

Kieran hesitated, studying her carefully. "You're exhausted."

"I don't care."

"You should."

Riley let out a harsh laugh. "Kieran, I threw a wolf across a room tonight. My body is doing things it shouldn't be able to do. I felt it trying to take over. If I wait too long"

She swallowed hard, shaking her head.

"I can't risk it."

Kieran held her gaze for a long moment. Then, finally, he nodded.

"All right," he said. "Let's begin."

The training started at dawn.

Riley's body ached, her muscles screaming in protest, but she pushed through it.

Kieran tested her speed first, forcing her to move purely on instinct. Every time she thought before she acted, he knocked her off balance. Every time she hesitated, he used it against her.

"You're holding back," Kieran said, dodging another one of her attacks.

Riley gritted her teeth. "Because I don't know what I am."

Kieran's golden eyes locked onto hers. "Then find out."

Something snapped inside her.

Riley lunged fast, faster than before.

This time, she didn't overthink it.

She let her body move, let her instincts take over.

She almost hit him.

But Kieran twisted at the last second, narrowly avoiding her strike. He stepped back, breathing hard, and for the first time

He smiled.

Riley stared at him, chest rising and falling rapidly.

She didn't know what had just happened.

But she felt it.

Something inside her was waking up.

Something she couldn't ignore.

And for the first time, she wasn't sure she wanted to.
###chapter 13: Fire and Fractures
Riley's breath came in sharp, ragged bursts as she lunged again, muscles burning, sweat slicking her skin.

Kieran dodged her strike with infuriating ease, stepping just out of reach. "Too slow," he taunted.

Riley growled and spun, aiming a kick toward his ribs. He blocked it, his forearm bracing against her shin before shoving her back.

She staggered but caught herself before she could hit the ground.

"Again," Kieran said.

Riley clenched her jaw. Her body hurt. They had been at this for hours, and every inch of her screamed for rest. But she didn't stop. She couldn't stop.

Not when she knew what was at stake.

She adjusted her stance, watching the way Kieran moved. His muscles tensed slightly, anticipating her next attack.

Good.

She feinted left, then shifted her weight at the last second, aiming a strike to his ribs. This time, she was faster.

This time

She hit him.

Kieran grunted as her fist connected. He barely moved, but she saw the flicker of surprise in his golden eyes.

Riley grinned.

Then she was on the ground.

She gasped as Kieran swept her legs out from under her in one swift motion, pinning her before she could react. His body was warm and solid, his weight pressing her against the damp earth.

"Don't get cocky," he murmured, golden eyes locked on hers.

Riley's heart pounded, her breath coming fast.

And suddenly, she was aware of everything.

The heat of his body. The way his chest rose and fell against hers. The sharp angle of his jaw, the way his lips parted slightly as he breathed.

Her skin burned.

Kieran must have realized it at the same moment because his expression shifted his amusement fading into something else. Something dangerous.

Riley swallowed hard.

Kieran did not move.

His eyes flickered down to her lips, just for a second, before snapping back up to hers.

Something cracked between them, something too sharp, too intense.

Riley's throat went dry.

"Kieran," she whispered.

He tensed, his grip tightening slightly

And then a voice shattered the moment.

"Well, this is interesting."

Riley flinched. Kieran jerked away from her so fast it was like he had been burned.

Callum stood at the edge of the clearing, smirking.

Riley's blood ran cold.

Kieran was already moving, stepping in front of her before she could react. His entire body radiated tension, muscles coiled tight like he was ready to tear into Callum.

Callum only tilted his head, his golden eyes glinting with amusement. "What's wrong, Wolfe? Didn't mean to get caught?"

Riley scrambled to her feet, her pulse hammering. "What the hell do you want?"

Callum's smirk widened. "What, no 'thank you' for interrupting?"

Kieran growled.

Callum laughed. "Relax, lover boy. I'm not here to fight."

Riley's stomach twisted. Callum was never just there to talk.

Kieran must have known it too, because his voice was low, dangerous. "Then why are you here?"

Callum's gaze flicked to Riley, his expression shifting. "Because she doesn't have much time left."

Riley stiffened. "What does that mean?"

Callum's smirk faded. For once, there was something serious in his expression.

"You feel it, don't you?" he said, voice softer now. "The fire under your skin. The hunger."

Riley's hands curled into fists.

She did.

She had felt it for days now the way her body ached for something she couldn't name, the way her instincts were sharper, wilder, harder to control.

Callum took a slow step forward, ignoring Kieran's warning snarl. "You're changing, Riley. And if you don't learn to control it soon"

He tilted his head.

"Well. Let's just say you won't like what happens next."

Riley's breath caught in her throat.

She didn't want to listen to him. She didn't.

But something deep inside her whispered that he was right.

Something inside her was breaking.

Callum watched her carefully, then sighed. "Tell me, Wolfe, how long were you planning on hiding this from her?"

Kieran's entire body tensed.

Riley frowned. "Hiding what?"

Callum's smirk returned, slow and knowing. "Oh, he didn't tell you?"

Riley's stomach churned. "Tell me what?"

Kieran didn't answer.

Callum chuckled, shaking his head. "You really should have told her, Wolfe. Before she figured it out the hard way."

Riley turned to Kieran, her pulse hammering. "Kieran," she said slowly, "what is he talking about?"

Kieran's jaw clenched.

Callum exhaled dramatically. "Fine. I'll do it myself."

Then he turned to Riley, his golden eyes gleaming.

"You're not just changing," he said, voice laced with something almost gentle. "You're running out of time."

Riley felt the ground tilt beneath her.

"What?" she whispered.

Callum stepped closer, his gaze steady. "You're not just turning into something, Riley. You're losing yourself. And if you don't get a grip on it soon"

His smirk was gone now.

"you won't be you anymore."

A cold shiver crawled up Riley's spine.

"No," she breathed. "That's not"

Callum lifted a brow. "You think it's a coincidence your claws came out without warning? That your senses are sharper than they should be?"

Her breath hitched.

Callum's voice softened. "You're changing faster than you're supposed to. And if it keeps going like this"

He shrugged.

Riley took a shaky step back.

She turned to Kieran. "Tell me he's lying."

Kieran's golden eyes met hers.

And for the first time

She saw fear.

Not for himself.

For her.

Her stomach dropped.

"Oh my God," she whispered.

Kieran exhaled slowly. "Riley"

"You knew," she choked out. "You knew, and you didn't tell me?"

Kieran stepped toward her, but she backed away.

"I was going to tell you," he said, voice tight. "I just"

"When?" Riley snapped. "When it was too late?"

Kieran's jaw clenched, but he didn't deny it.

That silence shattered something inside her.

She shook her head, something hot and wild curling beneath her skin. "I trusted you."

Kieran's expression was pained. "I was trying to protect you."

Riley let out a bitter laugh. "By lying to me?"

"I didn't want you to be afraid."

"I am afraid," Riley snapped, her voice sharp. "Not because of what's happening to me because you hid it."

Kieran exhaled, but there was nothing he could say.

Because he had hidden it.

And now, Riley didn't know if she could ever trust him again.

She turned back to Callum, her heartbeat wild.

"What do I have to do?" she asked.

Kieran went rigid. "Riley, don't."

Callum smirked, his golden eyes gleaming. "Smart girl."

Riley ignored Kieran's warning glare.

Because right now, she didn't care about his secrets.

She didn't care about his excuses.

She just wanted the truth.

Even if it burned.

Kieran grabbed Riley's wrist before she could take another step toward Callum. His grip wasn't rough, but there was an urgency in his touch, a silent plea.

"Don't," he said, his voice low and raw.

Riley yanked her arm free. "Give me one reason why I should listen to you."

Kieran's jaw tightened. "Because he's manipulating you."

Callum let out an exaggerated sigh. "Oh, come on, Wolfe. I'm just helping her."

Kieran turned on him, golden eyes flashing with fury. "The hell you are."

"Really?" Callum mused. "Because I don't see you offering her answers. You knew she was losing herself, and yet you waited. What were you hoping for? That she'd just magically figure it out before it was too late?"

Kieran's entire body tensed, but he didn't answer.

Because Callum was right.

Riley's throat tightened.

She turned back to Kieran, every muscle in her body taut. "You had days to tell me. Days to explain what was happening. But instead, you let me train like it was just some normal fight."

"I was trying to buy time," Kieran said, his voice strained. "To find another way."

"Another way to do what?" she snapped. "Pretend this isn't happening?"

Kieran ran a hand through his hair, frustration bleeding into his every movement. "No. To stop it before it got worse."

Riley let out a bitter laugh. "Well, congrats, Kieran. It's worse."

Kieran flinched.

For the first time since she'd met him, he looked like he didn't know what to say.

That hurt more than anything else.

Callum, of course, looked entirely too pleased with himself. "Well," he said, clapping his hands together. "Now that the lovers' quarrel is over, are you ready to hear the real solution?"

Kieran's glare could have burned holes through him. "If you so much as"

"Save it," Callum interrupted, rolling his eyes. "We all know Riley isn't listening to you right now."

He turned back to her, his expression shifting, softening.

"You feel it, don't you?" he murmured. "The fire in your blood. The way your instincts are taking over."

Riley said nothing.

Because she did feel it.

Even now, she could feel the heat beneath her skin, the slow, curling hunger creeping up her spine. The wrongness she had tried so hard to ignore.

Callum's voice dropped to something almost gentle. "I can teach you how to use it."

Kieran let out a low growl. "Over my dead body."

Callum smirked. "Tempting, Wolfe. But this isn't your choice."

He turned back to Riley, his golden eyes burning.

"It's yours."
###chapter 14: A Deal with the Devil 
Riley's pulse pounded in her ears, drowning out the world around her.

Kieran was talking no, arguing with Callum, his voice sharp with fury, but Riley barely heard a word.

Because Callum was right.

This was her choice.

And she didn't know what the hell to do.

She could still feel it, the heat curling under her skin, the hunger pressing against her ribs, the instincts that were getting harder to fight. If she lost control, she knew there would be no coming back.

But could she trust Callum to help her?

Kieran stepped in front of her, his expression hard. "Riley, don't listen to him."

Callum let out a dramatic sigh. "There you go again, trying to make choices for her." His golden eyes flicked to Riley, sharp with amusement. "A little controlling, don't you think?"

Kieran growled, his hands clenched into fists.

"Enough," Riley snapped, stepping between them before Kieran could throw a punch. "This isn't about you two, this is about me."

Callum smirked. "Glad someone finally said it."

Kieran exhaled sharply, turning his attention back to Riley. "You can't trust him."

Riley crossed her arms. "And I'm supposed to just trust you instead?"

Kieran flinched.

For a second, guilt twisted in her chest. But she wasn't going to back down.

Not after he had lied to her.

Not after she had nearly lost herself because of it.

Kieran shook his head. "You don't know what he wants."

Callum raised a brow. "That's easy. I want her."

Riley stiffened.

Kieran lunged.

Before he could reach Callum, Riley grabbed his arm and yanked him back harder than she should have been able to. Kieran stumbled slightly, eyes flashing with shock.

She had moved on instinct.

Just like before.

Her breath hitched.

Callum smiled like he had just won.

"See?" he said softly. "You're already stronger than you were yesterday."

Riley forced herself to breathe, to focus, to ignore the way her body felt right when she had moved.

"What do you want from me?" she demanded, voice tight.

Callum's smirk didn't waver. "I want to help you. I want you to survive."

Kieran took a step closer to her. "He wants to use you."

Callum tilted his head. "Says the guy who kept her in the dark."

Riley hated that he had a point.

She swallowed hard, turning her gaze back to Callum. "And what if I say no?"

Callum's smirk disappeared.

"Then," he said, "you'll lose yourself."

The words settled in her chest like a stone.

Callum wasn't threatening her.

He was warning her.

And that terrified her more than anything.

She clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

Then, slowly, she said, "Fine."

Kieran stiffened. "Riley"

"I'll hear what he has to say."

Callum's smirk returned, slow and satisfied. "Good choice."

Kieran grabbed her wrist again, his touch warm, desperate. "You don't have to do this."

Riley looked up at him, at the worry etched into his golden eyes, at the way he was silently begging her to trust him again.

But he had already lost that chance.

She gently pulled her hand away.

"I think I do."

And with that, she turned to Callum.

She had made her choice.

And now, there was no turning back.

The moment Riley pulled away from Kieran, something shifted.

The air between them, once tense but full of unspoken understanding, now felt fractured. The look in his golden eyes wasn't just frustration, it was a betrayal.

And yet, Riley forced herself to stand tall, to ignore the sinking weight in her stomach as she turned fully to Callum.

"Talk," she said. "But I'm not promising anything."

Callum's smirk widened. "That's all I need."

Kieran let out a sharp breath. "Riley, don't do this."

She didn't look at him. She couldn't.

Because if she did, she might hesitate. And right now, hesitation was dangerous.

Callum stepped closer, his golden eyes gleaming in the dim morning light. "You're changing," he said, his voice smooth, coaxing. "It's not just instincts, it's your body reshaping itself. You've felt it, haven't you? The strength? The speed?"

Riley clenched her jaw.

Yes.

Of course, she had felt it.

The heat under her skin, the pull in her muscles, the way she had moved without thinking like something inside her already knew what to do.

But admitting it to Callum felt like handing him a weapon.

So she stayed silent.

Callum, of course, saw right through her. "You can fight it all you want," he murmured, "but it won't stop. It wants to take over."

A chill crawled up her spine.

She knew that.

She had felt that.

And that was what terrified her the most.

"Let me help you," Callum continued. "Let me show you how to use it, how to control it before it controls you."

Kieran stepped between them, his voice a low growl. "Control it? Or use her for whatever twisted plan you're hiding?"

Callum sighed, looking almost bored. "Still so paranoid, Wolfe. It's exhausting." He turned back to Riley, expression softening. "I don't need to use you, Riley. You're already powerful. You just don't know it yet."

Kieran's hands clenched into fists. "She's not going anywhere with you."

Callum raised an eyebrow. "That's not your choice."

He turned to Riley again, watching her closely.

"This is your decision," he said, voice softer now. "Come with me. Train with me. I'll help you figure out what you are."

Kieran's voice was tight. "You can't trust him."

Riley inhaled sharply, forcing herself to focus.

She knew Callum was dangerous. She knew he had his agenda.

But she also knew that if she didn't get answers soon, she would lose herself.

She had already started slipping.

Already started changing.

She had felt it the night before when her claws had appeared without warning.

And she had felt it again today when she had thrown Kieran back without even meaning to.

If she didn't learn how to control this soon, she wouldn't be Riley anymore.

And that thought terrified her more than anything.

So she exhaled slowly, and

"I'll go."

Kieran froze.

For a second, the world itself seemed to stop.

Then

"No," Kieran said, his voice hoarse, raw. "No, you don't have to do this."

Riley turned to him, her throat tight. "I do."

Kieran's golden eyes searched hers, desperate. "Not with him."

Riley swallowed hard. "Then who?"

Kieran opened his mouth, then closed it.

And that silence that hesitation was the final nail in the coffin.

Because he didn't know.

He didn't have another way.

And Riley was done waiting.

She turned back to Callum.

"I leave alone," she said firmly. "No tricks. No backup. Just me."

Callum smirked. "I wouldn't dream of taking anyone else."

Kieran grabbed her wrist again, harder this time, his breathing uneven. "Riley, please."

Riley felt her chest tighten, her resolve waver

But it was already too late.

She had made her choice.

So she gently pulled her wrist free and took a step back.

Away from Kieran.

Away from safety.

His expression broke.

But he didn't try to stop her again.

Because he knew.

He knew.

She turned one last time, meeting his golden eyes.

Then she walked away.

And she didn't look back.

Every step Riley took away from Kieran felt heavier than the last like the earth itself was trying to drag her back.

But she didn't stop.

Couldn't stop.

Because if she hesitated now if she let herself turn around and see the look on Kieran's face one more time she might not have the strength to leave.

Callum moved beside her, his steps unhurried, casual, as he had already won.

And maybe he had.

Because Riley was going with him.

She was choosing this.

Her throat tightened, but she forced herself to keep walking, to ignore the storm brewing in her chest.

Behind her, she heard Nova's voice, sharp and disbelieving.

"Riley, what the hell?"

Riley swallowed hard. "I have to do this, Nova."

Nova let out a short, bitter laugh. "With him? Are you serious?"

Riley stopped.

Turned.

Met Nova's eyes, which were blazing with frustration and something else something close to hurt.

Riley's fingers curled into fists at her sides. "I don't have another choice."

Nova stepped forward, shaking her head. "That's bullsh*t and you know it."

"Nova"

"You do have a choice, Riley. And you're making the wrong one."

Riley flinched.

Because deep down, a small, treacherous part of her agreed.

But that didn't change the fact that she was still changing, still losing herself. And no one, not Kieran, not Nova, not even Elena had given her a real answer on how to stop it.

Callum had.

That made all the difference.

"I have to go," Riley said, her voice quieter now.

Nova stared at her for a long moment, jaw clenched.

Then she exhaled sharply and muttered, "Fine. Go."

The words felt like a slap.

But Riley didn't argue.

Didn't apologize.

She just nodded once, then turned back toward Callum.

He was watching her carefully, his golden eyes gleaming with something unreadable.

"Are you ready?" he asked.

No.

But she nodded anyway.

And then, just like that

She was gone.

Walking into the woods with the one person she had sworn to never trust.

And leaving everything else behind.
###chapter15: A Path of No Return
The forest swallowed Riley whole.

The further she walked, the more the weight of her choice settled in her chest, heavy and unrelenting. She had left Kieran and Nova behind. Left the only people who had truly cared about her.

And for what?

For Callum?

For answers, she wasn't sure she even wanted.

Beside her, Callum moved with an easy confidence, his golden eyes gleaming in the dim light filtering through the trees. He didn't speak, didn't gloat like she had expected him to.

And somehow, that was worse.

It meant he didn't need to say anything.

Because he had already won.

Riley exhaled slowly, trying to steady her breath. "Where are we going?"

Callum smirked, tilting his head toward her. "Somewhere you can learn."

That wasn't an answer.

But before Riley could snap at him, a sharp pain lanced through her skull.

She stumbled.

Callum was in front of her instantly, catching her before she could fall. His grip was firm, grounding, but she barely noticed.

Because her head was splitting open.

Not literally but it felt like it.

Images flickered in her mind, too fast, too blurred to make sense of.

A flash of golden eyes.

A snarl of rage.

Blood in the snow.

And then

A voice.

"You're not supposed to be here."

Riley gasped, her vision snapping back to reality.

Her knees nearly buckled, but Callum steadied her, his expression unreadable.

"What was that?" she whispered.

Callum studied her for a long moment, then murmured, "Looks like we're not the only ones watching you."

Riley's stomach twisted.

She yanked herself free from his grip, her pulse slamming against her ribs. "That wasn't real."

Callum arched a brow. "Wasn't it?"

She opened her mouth and then shut it.

Because she didn't know.

She had never experienced anything like that before. It wasn't just a nightmare. It felt real. Like a memory

Except it wasn't hers.

Her breathing quickened. "What the hell is happening to me?"

Callum's smirk faded, his golden eyes darkening with something serious.

"That," he said softly, "is what I'm going to help you find out."

Riley swallowed hard, trying to push down the panic clawing at her throat.

Because she had a sinking feeling

That this was only the beginning.

Riley's hands trembled as she pressed them to her temples, her skull still throbbing from whatever the hell had just happened. The memory, if that's what it even was, was already slipping away, leaving only the ghost of a voice and the sharp sting of wrongness curling inside her chest.

"You felt that, didn't you?" Callum murmured, watching her with unsettling amusement.

Riley inhaled sharply, forcing herself to steady her breath. "I don't know what that was."

Callum took a slow step forward, his golden eyes gleaming. "It was a warning."

Her stomach twisted. "From who?"

Callum tilted his head, considering. "Now that's the real question, isn't it?"

A low growl built in Riley's throat before she could stop it. She was sick of his games, his riddles, the way he always knew more than he said. "Start talking, or I walk."

Callum laughed at that, shaking his head. "Walk where exactly? Back to your precious Kieran? You chose this, Riley. You walked away from them."

Her jaw clenched. "That doesn't mean I trust you."

Callum smirked. "Good. You shouldn't."

The admission startled her.

For a second, she didn't know how to respond.

But before she could process it, the air around them shifted.

Callum tensed.

So did Riley.

The trees, once swaying gently with the wind, suddenly stilled. The usual sounds of the forest, the rustling leaves, and the distant chirping of birds vanished, swallowed by a heavy, unnatural silence.

Something was watching them.

Riley's pulse spiked. She turned sharply, scanning the treeline, but there was nothing.

No movement.

No scent.

And that was what made her blood turn cold.

Callum let out a low breath, his voice barely above a whisper. "They've found us faster than I thought."

Riley's fingers twitched. "Who?"

A sharp crack echoed through the trees.

Riley spun.

A dark figure stepped out from the shadows.

Not a wolf.

Not even a man.

It was something else entirely.

And the moment Riley met its eyes

She knew.

This was what had been calling to her.

This was what had been waiting for.

The figure's voice was like smoke curling through her mind, low and ancient.

"You don't belong to him, child."

Riley's breath caught.

Because for the first time

She wasn't sure if it was talking about Callum.

Or Kieran.

Riley's blood ran cold.

The figure stood at the edge of the trees, just barely illuminated by the silver slivers of moonlight filtering through the branches. It wasn't just a shadow, it was something else, something ancient.

Tall. Cloaked in darkness. Its features weren't entirely human, yet they weren't entirely beast either. Its eyes gleamed like polished obsidian as if they had seen things no mortal ever should.

And when it spoke again, the voice didn't come from its mouth.

It pressed into Riley's skull, wrapping around her thoughts like smoke.

"You don't belong to him."

Riley's breath hitched.

Callum took a step forward, placing himself slightly in front of her. His usual cocky expression was gone, replaced by something sharper. "Took you long enough," he muttered.

The figure didn't move. Didn't blink.

But somehow, Riley felt its attention shift.

"You are meddling in things beyond your understanding, wolf."

Callum's smirk returned, but it was tight. "And yet, here we are."

Riley swallowed hard. "Who are you?" she demanded.

The figure's gaze snapped back to her.

The ground beneath her shook.

Not physically but something inside her reacted to it, like a second heartbeat pounding beneath her ribs.

"You already know the answer, child," the voice whispered.

Riley's stomach twisted.

No.

No, she didn't.

She couldn't.

But the burning sensation in her chest said otherwise.

Memories that weren't hers flickered at the edges of her mind golden eyes flashing in the dark, a silver blade dripping with blood, a name that had been lost to time.

Riley staggered back, pressing a hand against her chest.

What was this?

What was happening to her?

Callum glanced at her, his expression unreadable. "Looks like you're finally feeling it, huh?"

Riley barely heard him.

The figure stepped closer, its movements slow and deliberate.

"You are not meant to be here," it murmured. "You were not meant to survive."

Riley's breath caught in her throat.

And for the first time since this nightmare began

She realized that whatever she was turning into

It hadn't been an accident.

It had been a mistake.

A mistake the universe wanted to correct.

A sharp chill ran down Riley's spine.

The figure's words settled in her bones like ice, freezing her from the inside out. You were not meant to survive.

She wanted to reject it. To tell this creature that it was wrong. That she was meant to be here, meant to fight, meant to exist.

But deep down, in the place she had been too afraid to look, something in her agreed.

Something inside her had always felt off like a piece of her soul didn't quite fit.

And now she knew why.

She wasn't supposed to be here.

The knowledge clawed at her, sinking sharp fangs into her thoughts. Was that why everything was spiraling out of control? Was that why she was changing too fast, slipping away before she could even understand what she was becoming?

Had she been living on borrowed time all along?

Riley's hands curled into fists. "What are you saying?" she forced out.

The figure took another step forward.

Callum tensed beside her, his usual amusement gone. "Back off," he warned, his voice low.

The figure ignored him.

"You were meant to die that night, child," it whispered. "But something interfered. Something wrong."

The words hit her like a fist to the ribs.

Her head spun, flashes of that night the attack, the pain, the way Kieran had looked at her afterward why had he looked at her like that?

Riley sucked in a sharp breath. "You're lying."

The figure's obsidian eyes gleamed.

"Am I?"

The world tilted beneath her feet.

No.

No, this wasn't possible.

But

The mark.

The way she was changing too fast.

The way even Kieran had hesitated when she demanded the truth.

Oh, God.

What if

What if this wasn't just happening to her?

What if someone had made it happen?

Her pulse pounded in her ears. "Who?" she rasped. "Who interfered?"

The figure was silent for a long moment.

Then, softly, it murmured

"You already know."

The words hit harder than any physical blow.

Riley's breath caught.

And in that single, horrifying moment

She knew.

She knew.

She turned sharply, her chest aching, her vision blurring

And locked eyes with Kieran.
###chapter 16: The Lies Between Us
Riley's world shattered.

The moment her eyes locked onto Kieran's, everything else fell away: the trees, the cold air, even the shadowed figure standing just feet away. None of it mattered.

Because the truth had been staring her in the face all along.

"You already know."

She had known. Somewhere, deep down, she had always known.

Kieran had been there the night it all started. He had saved her.

But what if he had done more than that?

Her pulse roared in her ears, a deafening drumbeat against the silence stretching between them.

"Kieran," she whispered, her voice barely holding steady. "Tell me it's not true."

His jaw clenched, his golden eyes flickering with something she couldn't read.

Something close to guilt.

Callum, still standing beside her, let out a low chuckle. "Oh, this just got interesting."

Kieran moved.

Faster than she could process, he was in front of her, his hands reaching for her arms, his eyes burning with something desperate. "Riley, listen to me"

She flinched.

And something inside her snapped.

A snarl tore from her throat, raw and inhuman, as she jerked back from his touch. The force of it sent her stumbling, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

"You did this," she choked out. "You interfered."

Kieran's entire body tensed, his hands still hovering in the air like he wanted to reach for her again but knew he couldn't.

Callum let out a slow breath, amusement still lingering in his tone. "Well, Wolfe? Care to explain how you managed to break the rules of the universe?"

Kieran ignored him. His golden eyes stayed locked on Riley's, filled with something that made her stomach twist.

He wasn't denying it.

That hurt more than anything.

"Tell me," she whispered, her hands curling into fists. "Tell me what you did."

Kieran exhaled shakily, and when he finally spoke, his voice was raw. "I" He swallowed. "I couldn't let you die."

The words slammed into her chest like a physical blow.

She staggered.

Kieran took a step forward, his hands shaking slightly. "Riley, you don't understand"

"Don't," she snapped, her vision blurring. "Don't you dare try to justify this?"

"I wasn't thinking," he said, his voice breaking at the edges. "You were dying. I didn't know what would happen, I just" He ran a hand through his hair, his frustration bleeding into every movement. "I just couldn't lose you."

A sharp, bitter laugh broke from Riley's lips. "So what, you played God?"

"I saved you," Kieran said fiercely.

"No, Kieran," she shot back, her throat tight. "You changed me."

Silence.

And in that silence, everything between them fractured.

Because he wasn't arguing.

He wasn't denying it.

The truth settled in her chest, suffocating and unbearable.

She had never been meant to survive that night.

Kieran had made a choice she had never been given.

And now she was paying for it.

Riley shook her head, stepping back. "I trusted you," she whispered, her voice breaking.

Kieran's entire face twisted with pain. "Riley"

"I trusted you," she said again, louder this time, her vision burning. "And all this time, you were lying to me."

"I was trying to protect you."

"No," she snapped, her body trembling. "You were protecting yourself."

Kieran flinched.

But Riley wasn't done.

"You knew what you did was wrong," she accused. "That's why you didn't tell me. That's why you let me think I was just some accident. But I wasn't, was I?"

Kieran's throat bobbed. He opened his mouth and then closed it.

And that was the answer enough.

Riley inhaled sharply, every muscle in her body coiled so tightly she thought she might break.

The silence stretched between them like a canyon, too wide to ever cross.

And then

Callum let out a low whistle. "Damn. This is better than I expected."

Riley spun toward him, her blood still roaring with anger. "Shut up."

Callum raised his hands in mock surrender, his golden eyes gleaming with amusement. "I mean, I did tell you not to trust him."

Riley hated that he was right.

Hated it so much she wanted to tear something apart.

Kieran took another step forward. "Riley, please."

She backed away.

That single movement that rejection made something flicker in Kieran's golden eyes. Something close to panic.

But Riley didn't care.

She had trusted him with everything she had.

And he had broken her.

Her breath came fast, her chest aching, her claws pressing against her fingertips

No.

Not now.

Not like this.

She clenched her fists, forcing them back, shoving down the burning wildness clawing at her insides.

She would not lose control.

Not because of him.

Not because of anyone.

When she looked at Kieran again, the pain in his expression nearly wrecked her.

Good.

Now he knew how it felt.

Her voice was quiet but steady. "I'm done."

Kieran's entire body locked up.

Callum let out a slow exhale like he had expected this but still enjoyed seeing it unfold. "Oh, this is getting fun."

Riley ignored him.

She ignored everything.

She turned away from Kieran, her heart hammering so loudly it nearly drowned out her thoughts.

Then, without another word

She walked away.

This time, for good

Riley's breath came in short, sharp bursts as she walked.

She didn't know where she was going.

She didn't care.

All she knew was that she needed to get away.

Away from Kieran. Away from the truth. Away from the suffocating weight of everything he had done to her.

The forest blurred around her, dark shapes twisting in the dim light, but she barely registered them. Her thoughts were too loud, her heartbeat too wild.

"You weren't meant to survive."

The words echoed in her skull, rattling her bones, and making her feel like she was going to break apart at any second.

Kieran had saved her.

But in doing so, he had taken something from her.

Her choice.

Her humanity.

And now, she was something else entirely.

Something she didn't understand.

Something she was losing control of.

The worst part?

She had trusted him.

She had felt something for him.

And all this time, he had been keeping the biggest secret of all.

A sharp, bitter laugh escaped her lips before she could stop it.

She had been so stupid.

So blind.

"Running away, Riley?"

She stopped dead.

Callum's voice was smooth and easy, but she didn't miss the edge beneath it.

She turned, slowly, finding him watching her with something between amusement and calculation.

"I'm not running," she bit out.

Callum smirked. "Sure looks like it."

Riley clenched her jaw. "I don't need your commentary right now."

Callum sighed, tilting his head slightly. "Maybe not. But you do need something."

She narrowed her eyes. "And what's that?"

Callum's smirk faded.

"Control."

The word sent a shiver through her because he was right.

She didn't know how much longer she could fight the thing inside her, the hunger, the instincts that were starting to take over.

But trusting Callum?

That was a different kind of gamble.

Callum took a step forward, watching her carefully. "You want to learn? I can teach you."

Riley hesitated.

This was dangerous.

She knew that.

But right now, she wasn't sure she had another option.

So, slowly, she said, "Prove it."

Callum's golden eyes gleamed. "Gladly."

And just like that

The deal was struck.

And Riley had no idea if she had just saved herself

Or sealed her fate.

A sharp gust of wind cut through the trees, carrying the thick scent of pine and damp earth. Riley barely noticed. Her pulse roared in her ears, drowning out everything but the words that had just left her mouth.

Prove it.

Callum's smirk deepened, but there was something else in his eyes now something calculating, something hungry.

"You want proof?" he mused, tilting his head. "Fine."

Before Riley could react, he moved.

Too fast.

Faster than any werewolf she had seen before.

In a blink, he was behind her, his breath warm against her neck.

Her entire body reacted.

Riley spun, instincts kicking in before her mind could catch up, claws unsheathing in a flash of silver.

She swiped hard.

But Callum was already gone.

She stumbled forward, heart hammering, her chest rising and falling too fast.

The bastard was toying with her.

A low chuckle echoed from the shadows. "Not bad," Callum said smoothly. "But not good enough."

Riley's teeth clenched. "Try that again, and I'll"

"What?" Callum emerged from the trees, his golden eyes gleaming. "Land a hit?"

Riley's breathing was ragged, her muscles tensed to the point of breaking.

She had moved on instinct. Again.

And her claws

They had come too easily.

Like they were meant to be there.

Her stomach twisted.

Callum took another step toward her, slower this time. "You feel it, don't you?" he murmured.

Riley swallowed hard.

Because she did.

That rush of movement. The way the world had sharpened for just a second. The power behind her swing.

It felt natural.

And that terrified her more than anything.

Callum stopped just in front of her, watching her closely.

"You're already changing, Riley," he said, voice quieter now. "And Kieran? He doesn't have the stomach to help you through it."

Riley flinched.

Because maybe Callum was right.

Maybe Kieran had tried to stop this.

Maybe he had been afraid of what she was becoming.

But Callum wasn't afraid.

He saw it.

He wanted it.

Riley exhaled slowly, her thoughts tangled. "What do you want from me?" she whispered.

Callum studied her for a moment.

Then he leaned in, just enough that his voice was a breath against her skin.

"I want you to stop fighting who you are."

Riley's breath caught.

Because of the terrifying part?

She wasn't sure she wanted to fight it anymore.
###chapter 17: A Monster’s Reflection
Riley stood frozen, Callum's words lingering in the air like smoke thick, suffocating, impossible to ignore.

"I want you to stop fighting who you are."

Her pulse was too loud, her breath too fast. Her body still thrummed with the leftover adrenaline from their exchange, her claws just beginning to retreat.

She should have been disgusted.

She should have stepped back, pushed him away, and told him to go to hell.

But she didn't.

Because the worst part?

She felt it.

That dangerous, unspoken truth curled in her chest like a secret she hadn't been ready to admit.

She was changing.

And maybe just maybe Callum wasn't wrong.

Her throat was dry as she forced herself to speak. "And if I don't stop fighting?"

Callum's smirk softened just barely. "Then you'll break."

The certainty in his voice sent a shiver through her.

And for the first time, she wondered if she already was breaking.

She sucked in a breath, stepping away from him, needing space, needing something real to hold on to. The cold air bit at her skin, grounding her, but it wasn't enough.

Nothing was enough.

Because no matter how much she tried to shove it down, to push the truth away

A part of her wanted to let go.

A part of her wanted to know what she was.

Callum didn't chase her when she stepped back. He just watched, golden eyes flickering with something close to understanding.

"That's the thing about instincts," he murmured. "You can only fight them for so long."

Riley clenched her jaw, forcing herself to meet his gaze.

"I'm not like you," she said, her voice steadier than she felt.

Callum's smirk returned, slow and knowing.

"Not yet."

A sharp, bitter laugh bubbled in her throat, but she swallowed it down. She couldn't let him get under her skin not now. Not when everything inside her was already splintering apart.

She turned away from him, forcing her breathing to slow.

But as she did

Her reflection caught her eye.

A pool of water rested between the roots of an ancient tree, dark and glassy beneath the moonlight. At first, it was just a trick of the light, just her tired face staring back at her.

But then

The reflection shifted.

Her breath caught.

Because it wasn't her.

Not really.

The eyes staring back at her weren't her usual stormy gray. They were darker.

Hungrier.

Something moved beneath the surface of her skin, subtle but wrong, like something waiting just beneath the surface, waiting for her to slip, to let go.

The ground swayed under her feet.

No.

No, this wasn't real.

She wasn't

A hand brushed against her shoulder.

She jumped, spinning sharply, her claws flashing out before she could stop them.

Callum didn't flinch.

He just looked at her, gaze unwavering. "You see it now, don't you?"

Riley swallowed hard, her heartbeat a wild, uneven rhythm against her ribs.

Because God help her

She did.

And she wasn't sure she could stop it.

Or if she even wanted to.

Riley's breathing was unsteady and uneven.

The reflection in the water still stared back at her, its too-dark eyes gleaming with something not her own.

She squeezed her eyes shut, willing it to disappear.

It's not real.

But when she opened them again

The reflection was still there.

Her chest tightened, something sharp and cold crawling beneath her skin.

Something was wrong.

Something was waiting.

Callum's voice was quiet, careful. "You feel it, don't you?"

Riley's fingers curled into fists. "I don't"

But she couldn't finish the sentence.

Because it would be a lie.

She did feel it.

That hollow space inside her, the creeping sensation that something was missing, something unfinished.

Or worse

Something waiting to wake up.

Callum stepped closer, slow, deliberate. "You're on the edge, Riley. I can see it."

Her stomach twisted. "And you like that, don't you?"

Callum smirked. "I like the truth."

Her jaw clenched. "And what truth is that?"

His golden eyes gleamed. "That you're not afraid of becoming something else."

Riley's pulse spiked.

Because the worst part?

The part she couldn't deny?

A small, traitorous piece of her wasn't afraid at all.

She took a sharp step back, trying to shove the thought away. "I don't need you in my head, Callum."

He let out a low chuckle. "You think I need to be in your head? You're already asking yourself the question."

Her breath caught.

Because he was right.

God.

He was right.

She turned away from him, staring at the ground, trying to breathe through the wildfire spreading beneath her skin.

She wasn't like him.

She wasn't.

She couldn't be.

But then why did it feel so right?

Callum didn't press her for an answer. He didn't need to.

Instead, his voice softened almost carefully.

"You don't have to fight it, Riley."

Her throat tightened.

She wasn't sure if he meant the change.

Or him.

And she wasn't sure which terrified her more.

Riley could still feel the shift. The way her body had reacted, instinct taking over before she even had time to think.

It felt too natural.

Too easy.

And Callum had seen it.

She forced herself to focus, to steady her breath. "I don't want this," she whispered, but the words felt thin, fragile.

Callum tilted his head, studying her with those sharp golden eyes. "Don't you?"

Riley's stomach twisted.

She wanted to say no.

She wanted to shove all of this away, to pretend she was still just the girl she had been before.

But that girl was gone.

She had been gone since the night Kieran had saved her-since the moment he had made that choice for her.

And now?

Now, she was something else entirely.

Callum took another step closer, his voice quieter now. "You can lie to yourself, Riley. But your body already knows the truth."

Her breath caught.

Because he was right.

Again.

She could feel it deep in her bones, in her blood, in the way her body itched to move, to fight, to let go.

It wasn't just instincts.

It was who she was now.

And she had spent too long running from it.

Callum's voice was softer this time. "You're afraid."

Riley swallowed hard. "Of what?"

His smirk faded, and for the first time, there was something real in his expression.

"You're afraid that you want this."

The words hit harder than she expected.

Because God help her

He wasn't wrong.

She wanted to scream, to deny it, to fight it.

But she couldn't.

Because in the quiet, broken pieces of herself, in the space between fear and fury

A small, treacherous part of her wanted to know what she could become.

Wanted to stop holding back.

Wanted to let go.

Riley's breath was shaky as she met Callum's gaze.

He already knew her answer.

And that terrified her more than anything.

Riley took a step back, the weight of Callum's words settling deep into her chest.

She wanted to deny it to fight it but every time she tried, the truth was there, staring her in the face.

She wanted to know what she was capable of.

She wanted to stop feeling like she was drowning in something she didn't understand.

She wanted control.

And Callum?

He knew it.

She forced herself to meet his gaze. "And what if you're wrong?" she whispered, her voice hoarse. "What if I don't want this?"

Callum's golden eyes gleamed with something unreadable. "Then why are you still here?"

Her breath caught.

Because she had the chance to run.

She could've turned around, walked back to Kieran and Nova, let them talk her down, fix her before she went too far.

But she hadn't.

She was still standing here.

Still listening.

Still considering it.

And that scared her more than anything.

Callum took another step closer, his voice softer now. "You can keep lying to yourself, Riley. Or you can stop being afraid."

Her hands shook.

Because wasn't that the real problem?

She was afraid.

Not just of what was happening to her.

But of what she wanted.

Her body had recognized this power before she had. It had moved without hesitation, without doubt.

It had felt right.

And she wasn't sure she wanted to fight that anymore.

A cold shiver crawled up her spine.

Callum smiled, but it wasn't mocking this time. It was something closer to knowing.

"You don't have to run from this," he murmured. "You just have to decide."

Riley exhaled slowly, staring at him, at the place where her reflection had been in the water.

At the girl who had already started to disappear.

At the monster she was becoming.

And the worst part?

She wasn't sure she hated it.

Not anymore.
###chapter 18: Dancing with the Devil
Riley had made her decision.

The weight of it settled deep in her bones as she stared at Callum, her pulse thrumming like a war drum against her ribs.

She should have been afraid.

But she wasn't.

Not anymore.

Because fear had kept her trapped and weak for too long.

Now, she was done being afraid.

Callum watched her carefully, his golden eyes flickering with something sharp. Amusement, maybe. Or approval.

"Good," he murmured. "I was starting to think you'd never get there."

Riley exhaled slowly. "I'm not there yet."

Callum smirked. "Oh, but you will be."

The certainty in his voice sent a shiver through her, but she ignored it.

She had made her choice.

And now?

Now, she had to live with it.

Callum turned, walking deeper into the trees without another word.

For a second, Riley hesitated.

One last moment to change her mind.

To turn back.

To run.

But she didn't.

Instead, she followed him into the dark.

Because she was tired of running.

And if she was going to become something else

She needed to know exactly what that meant.

They walked for hours.

The forest stretched around them, thick and endless, the towering trees casting long shadows beneath the silver sliver of the moon.

Riley's legs ached, but she didn't complain.

She had too many questions burning inside her.

Finally, when the silence had stretched too long, she spoke.

"Where are we going?"

Callum glanced at her, smirking. "What's wrong? Are you regretting your choice?"

Riley scowled. "Just answer the damn question."

Callum chuckled but didn't push her further. "There's a place," he said. "A place where the pack won't follow. Where no one will follow."

Riley frowned. "And what exactly is there?"

Callum's smirk faded, replaced by something almost serious.

"Answers," he said. "And maybe, if you're lucky, the truth."

Riley's stomach twisted.

The truth.

That was what she wanted, wasn't it?

But somehow, the way Callum said it like the truth was something dangerous, something deadly made her pulse spike.

Still, she didn't stop walking.

Because it was too late to turn back now.

And maybe just maybe she didn't want to.

They reached an old, abandoned structure just before dawn.

It was half-buried beneath the overgrowth, vines crawling up the cracked stone walls, the roof sagging like it had been forgotten by time itself.

Riley frowned. "This is it?"

Callum stepped forward, placing a hand on the worn wood of the door.

"This," he murmured, "is where you begin."

Then he pushed the door open

And the moment Riley stepped inside, everything changed.

Because the second she crossed the threshold, a wave of something wrong slammed into her, thick and alive and ancient.

Her knees buckled.

Callum caught her before she hit the ground.

His touch burned.

Not like fire-like recognition.

Like her body knew something her mind didn't.

Riley sucked in a sharp breath, trying to shake the feeling. "What the hell was that?"

Callum smiled.

But there was no amusement in it this time.

"You felt it," he murmured.

Riley's fingers curled into the fabric of his sleeve before she forced herself to let go. "What was that?" she demanded again, breathless.

Callum's golden eyes darkened.

"Your past."

Riley's pulse stopped.

She yanked herself free from his grip, stumbling back. "No," she whispered. "That's not possible."

Callum tilted his head. "Isn't it?"

Riley's chest ached.

Because the second he said it

She knew.

She had been here before.

Not in this lifetime. Not in a way that made sense.

But somewhere, in the shadows of her soul, in the fragments of a life, she couldn't remember

She had been here before.

And whatever had happened in this place?

It had changed her once.

Just like it was about to change her again.

The walls of the ruined structure seemed to close in around Riley, the weight of something ancient pressing against her skin.

She had been here before.

She didn't know how didn't want to know how but the second she stepped inside, her body recognized this place.

A flicker of something foreign stirred in her chest, something just out of reach.

A memory?

Or something worse?

Riley swallowed hard, forcing her voice to stay steady. "What is this place?"

Callum stepped deeper into the ruin, his fingers brushing along the broken stone walls like he could feel the history buried within them. "A place lost to time," he murmured. "A place that shouldn't exist."

Riley's pulse spiked.

"And yet," Callum continued, glancing at her over his shoulder, "here you are."

Her hands shook.

Because she had a terrible, sinking feeling that this wasn't just a coincidence.

That she wasn't just a coincidence.

She took a slow step forward, her breath shallow. The air inside the ruin was thick, humming with something unseen. A strange energy pulsed beneath her feet like the ground itself remembered something she didn't.

Her voice came out hoarse. "Tell me what's happening to me."

Callum turned fully now, his golden eyes gleaming in the dim light.

"You're waking up."

Riley inhaled sharply, her fingers curling at her sides. "Waking up to what?"

Callum's smirk was gone now.

For the first time, his expression was unreadable.

"To who you were before," he said simply.

A chill crawled up her spine.

"No," she whispered. "No, I don't"

"You feel it, don't you?" Callum cut in, stepping closer. His voice was soft, coaxing. "That pull in your chest. The way your body moves like it already knows what to do. The instincts you can't explain."

Riley's throat went dry.

Because he was right.

She did feel it.

She had felt it for weeks now the sharpness in her reflexes, the hunger curling beneath her skin, the way her body moved before she could think.

Like it remembered something she didn't.

Like she was something she didn't understand.

Riley took a step back, her breathing ragged. "I don't want this."

Callum tilted his head. "Liar."

Her stomach twisted.

Because the worst part?

The part she had tried to shove down, to ignore

Was that a small, treacherous part of her that did want this?

Wanted to know what she was.

Wanted to stop feeling lost.

Callum saw it.

He knew.

And somehow, that made it worse.

She exhaled sharply, trying to steady herself. "If you know something, if you know what I am, then just tell me."

Callum's smirk returned, slow and knowing. "Oh, I could."

Riley clenched her jaw. "Then"

"But," he interrupted smoothly, stepping closer again, "where's the fun in that?"

Riley let out a sharp, bitter laugh. "You think this is fun?"

Callum's golden eyes burned. "I think this is exactly what you were meant for."

Her chest ached.

Because, deep down, she knew he wasn't lying.

And that terrified her more than anything.

She sucked in a shaky breath, forcing herself to meet his gaze. "What do I have to do?"

Callum's smirk deepened.

And then, softly, he said

"Let go."

Riley's pulse stopped.

Because she wasn't sure she could.

Or if she even wanted to.

Let go.

The words curled around Riley's ribs, sinking into her like hooks, as they had always been waiting for her to hear them.

She should have rejected them.

She should have stepped back, turned around, and run.

But she didn't.

Because Callum was right.

She had spent so much time fighting this whatever this was. The instincts, the strength, the pull in her chest that only grew stronger the longer she tried to ignore it.

She had convinced herself that it was something she had to stop.

But what if she had been wrong?

What if it wasn't something to be fought, but something to be embraced?

Callum took another step closer, his voice quiet but sure. "You're standing at the edge, Riley. You can feel it, can't you? The power. The hunger. The truth."

Riley's fingers twitched.

Because she did feel it.

It burned under her skin, clawed at her insides, and begged to be acknowledged.

She wanted to deny it.

But she couldn't.

Not anymore.

Her voice came out unsteady. "And what happens if I let go?"

Callum's golden eyes gleamed, the corner of his mouth twitching upward.

"Then," he murmured, "you'll finally know what you are."

A chill ran through her.

Because she wanted to know.

She had never wanted anything more.

But something deep inside whispered that once she stepped over that line

There would be no coming back.

Her heart pounded, her thoughts tangled.

She had already lost so much.

Her old life.

Her trust in Kieran.

Her sense of who she was.

What else was there left to lose?

Callum watched her, patient, waiting.

He knew she was going to say yes.

Maybe he had known all along.

Riley took a slow breath.

And then

She closed her eyes.

And let go.

For a second, nothing happened.

Then

Pain.

Not physical. Not like claws or blades.

But something deep, something that cracked through her ribs and dug into her spine and filled her veins with fire.

Riley gasped, her body locking up, her knees buckling.

Callum caught her before she could hit the ground, gripping her arms. "Easy," he murmured. "You're almost there."

She could barely hear him.

Because something inside her was splitting open.

And for the first time

She knew.

She remembered.

A different life. A different her.

Blood on the snow.

Golden eyes filled with rage.

A voice whispering her true name

And just like that

Everything changed.
###chapter 19: The Awakening
Pain.

It wasn't sharp like a knife or the deep ache of a bruise. It was something older, deeper, a firestorm unraveling her, twisting through every inch of her body, every cell rewriting itself into something unfamiliar.

Riley gasped, clutching her ribs as a shockwave of raw, electric energy rolled through her.

It wasn't just inside her.

It was around her.

The ruins pulsed with it, the air thick and charged, as if the walls themselves remembered.

She collapsed to her knees, her breath coming in sharp, ragged gasps.

The visions rushed in not as memories, not yet, but as glimpses, flashes of something ancient, something hungry.

A battlefield.

Snow, red with blood.

A figure standing over the body is tall, armored, and wearing a crown of bone and silver.

The whisper of a name, curling through time like smoke.

Not Riley

Something else. Someone else.

Her pulse thundered. She pressed her hands against the cold stone, grounding herself. This isn't real. This isn't real.

A shadow moved in front of her.

Callum.

His golden eyes gleamed as he crouched down, his voice low, edged with satisfaction.

"You felt it, didn't you?"

Riley's fingers curled into fists.

"Shut up."

She wasn't ready. She couldn't be.

Callum didn't look surprised. If anything, he looked pleased.

"You were never just a girl, Riley."

Her breath caught.

She forced herself to her feet, ignoring the way her legs trembled. "I don't believe you."

Callum smirked, slow and knowing. "Liar."

Her chest ached.

Because the worst part?

The part she had been trying to shove down, to ignore?

Was that a small, treacherous part of her that did believe him?

The instincts she shouldn't have. The way her body knew things before she did how to fight, how to run, how to survive.

And the ruins.

She had never been here before.

But she had.

Hadn't she?

Her breath hitched. "What am I?"

Callum's smirk faded.

For the first time, his expression was unreadable.

"You were the beginning, Riley." His voice was quiet, but it struck like a blade. "And now, you're at the end."

Kieran felt it the moment it happened.

A pulse of wrongness, sliced through his chest like claws.

He staggered, gripping a tree for balance, his breath coming fast, uneven.

No.

No, no, no.

It was too soon.

His hands shook as he clenched them into fists. The air around him was charged, electric, the same feeling that came before a storm, before a shift.

He lifted his head toward the night sky, his golden eyes flashing.

"Riley."

Then he ran.

Riley's breathing slowed, her pulse still hammering.

Callum watched her, waiting.

She didn't like that.

Didn't like that he seemed so sure of her.

Like he had already won.

Her fingers twitched at her sides. "What do you mean, I was the beginning?"

Callum exhaled, running a hand through his dark hair. "The pack tells stories. Legends. They say we were always here. That we were always the strongest." His lips curled into something bitter. "But they're wrong."

Riley frowned. "What does that have to do with me?"

Callum's golden eyes darkened.

"Because you weren't one of us, Riley."

She went still.

A slow, creeping cold settled in her bones.

Callum took a step closer, his voice soft.

"You weren't a wolf," he said. "You were the one who hunted them."

The words slammed into her, knocking the breath from her lungs.

No.

That Wasn't

That couldn't

Her legs buckled again, and this time, when her knees hit the cold stone, the visions came back.

A blade in her hand.

Silver flames curled around her fingers.

A wolf, a man falling at her feet, golden eyes wide with rage.

And her voice, not her voice, but hers whispering something ancient, something final.

She gasped, jerking back into the present. Her whole body shook.

Callum was still there, watching. Waiting.

She forced herself up, her hands trembling.

"I don't believe you."

Callum raised an eyebrow.

"Are you sure?"

Her breath came fast, shallow.

Because she wasn't.

Not anymore.

A wolf howled in the distance.

Low. Long.

Mourning.

Or maybe

A warning.

Riley swallowed hard, her fingers twitching.

A dark realization settled over her, heavier than the night air.

The pack didn't fear her because of what she was becoming.

They feared her because of what she had already been.

A killer.

A monster.

The reason the war had started in the first place.

And if that was true if the past was truly repeating itself

Then this time, Riley wasn't sure she would survive it.

Everything changed.

The air inside the ruins felt heavier, and thicker, like the walls themselves were breathing. Riley's pulse roared in her ears, her body locking up as the visions crashed over her.

Not just memories.

Something more.

She staggered, her knees nearly buckling. Callum caught her before she hit the ground.

His grip was firm, steady too steady.

Because he had expected this.

He knew.

Riley gasped, her hands clutching at the stone floor beneath her, feeling the energy pulse through her veins like a second heartbeat.

"I" she started, but the words caught in her throat.

Callum crouched beside her, his golden eyes unreadable. "You're waking up."

Riley's breath came in short, sharp bursts. "No."

Callum's smirk was slow, knowing. "You can fight it all you want, but you felt it, didn't you?"

She shook her head, desperate to deny it.

Because the truth was terrifying.

Because she had felt something.

A connection.

A power she didn't understand.

And worst of all it felt familiar.

Callum leaned in slightly, voice dropping to a whisper. "Now tell me, Riley"

His golden eyes burned into hers.

"Who do you think you are?"

A chill slithered down her spine.

And for the first time, she had no answer.
###chapter 20: The Ruin’s Secret
The air inside the ruins shifted, pressing against Riley's skin like something living. The shadows in the corners stretched, breathing in time with her ragged heartbeat.

She should have run.

She should have turned back.

But she didn't.

Because the truth, the terrible, gut-wrenching truth was that a part of her didn't want to.

She needed to know.

Even if it destroyed her.

Even if she was already too far gone.

She met Callum's golden gaze, her fingers clenching into fists. "You're lying."

Callum let out a slow breath, shaking his head. "I don't have to lie, Riley. You already feel it, don't you?"

No.

Yes.

Her body did feel different. Lighter and heavier at the same time. Her blood hummed, like something beneath her skin was just waiting.

For what?

For her to stop fighting it?

Riley shook the thought away. "You said I was a hunter." Her voice was low, edged with uncertainty. "You're saying I I killed werewolves?"

Callum tilted his head. "Not just werewolves."

Her stomach twisted. "Then what?"

Callum's smirk returned, but this time, it was calculated. "Tell me, Riley. When you stepped into this ruin, what did you feel?"

Her breath hitched.

Because she knew.

The second she had crossed the threshold, a wave of something wrong had crashed into her. Thick. Alive. Ancient.

And familiar.

Like the walls of this place knew her.

Like they remembered.

Riley swallowed hard. "This place" She trailed off, trying to piece together the fragments in her head.

Callum finished for her.

"This was yours."

Silence.

Heavy. Smothering.

Then Riley laughed, sharp and bitter. "That's impossible."

Callum didn't flinch. "Is it?"

She stared at him, pulse roaring in her ears. "I'm seventeen. This place has been abandoned for centuries."

Callum's gaze burned through her. "You think time works the way you were taught?"

Riley's fingers twitched.

Because deep down, she had always felt it.

Something was wrong with her. Something is out of sync.

Dreams that weren't dreams. Memories that didn't belong to her.

And now this.

She turned away, pacing, forcing herself to breathe. "No. This doesn't make sense."

Callum didn't move. "Then let me make it simple."

She froze.

Callum stepped closer, voice quiet, dangerous.

"You weren't reincarnated, Riley."

Her breath stalled.

Callum smirked. "You were never supposed to die in the first place."

A sharp chill crawled up her spine.

Riley spun to face him, her chest tightening. "What does that mean?"

Callum took his time answering, letting the silence stretch between them like a blade. "It means," he said, "that you were something more than human. More than a wolf." He took another step, his golden eyes flashing. "You were something else entirely."

Something else.

The words settled over Riley, heavy as stone.

Her heartbeat hammered against her ribs.

"Then what am I?" she whispered.

Callum exhaled, gaze flickering to the ruin around them. "You already know the answer."

Riley swallowed hard. "No. I don't."

Callum studied her, something knowing in his expression. "Then let me ask you this." His voice softened, but the weight behind it thickened.

"In all your dreams, in all your visions Have you ever seen your face?"

Her lungs seized.

No.

No, she hadn't.

In every vision, every fragment of memory she had ever experienced, she had seen through someone else's eyes.

She had never looked in a mirror.

Never seen who she was.

Riley staggered back, shaking her head. "That doesn't mean anything."

Callum just smiled. "It means everything."

The walls of the ruin pressed in, her pulse a war drum in her skull.

This place had whispered to her.

Had called her.

Not like a memory.

Not like a home.

Like a prison.

A shudder ran through her.

She wasn't reborn.

She was waking up.

Her stomach churned. She needed to leave. Now.

She turned sharply, marching for the exit. "I'm done with this. I don't care what you think I am."

But Callum didn't try to stop her.

He just said, "Then why is the door sealed?"

Riley froze.

Slowly, she turned back.

And her blood ran cold.

The doorway she had walked through earlier, the only exit, was no longer open.

The vines had twisted across the frame, the stone entrance sealed over like it had never existed.

Riley's breath caught.

"What the hell?"

She rushed forward, pressing her hands against the wall, searching for some kind of hidden mechanism but there was nothing. Just a solid, unyielding stone.

Her heart pounded.

"This wasn't here before," she muttered. "I walked right through"

"The ruin reacts to you."

Riley turned to Callum, anger sparking in her veins. "What did you do?"

Callum raised his hands in surrender. "Nothing. This isn't me."

Riley's fingers curled. "Then who?"

Callum didn't answer.

But she could see it in his eyes.

The answer was her.

The ruins had changed because of her.

Riley shook her head. "No. That's not possible."

Callum exhaled, tilting his head. "Would you like me to prove it?"

She hesitated.

Then, slowly, she nodded.

Callum stepped closer, his golden eyes glinting. "Hold out your hand."

Riley hesitated but did as he said.

Callum lifted his hand but didn't touch her.

He just hovered his palm inches from hers.

The air between them crackled.

Something unseen shifted.

Then, beneath their feet, the ruins trembled.

The stone groaned, dust raining down from the ceiling. The air turned thick, electric and alive.

Riley's stomach twisted.

"I'm doing this?" she whispered.

Callum nodded. "You are."

Panic coiled in her throat.

She ripped her hand back, stumbling away.

The ruins stilled.

Riley's breath came fast, uneven.

Callum lowered his arm, studying her. "Do you believe me now?"

Riley's chest ached.

She didn't want to.

God, she didn't want to.

But she could feel it in her bones, in her blood, in the way the ruins had answered her.

She wasn't normal.

She had never been.

And now?

Now, she was awakening.

A sound broke the silence.

Low. Distant.

A howl.

Riley's pulse spiked.

Callum turned toward the sound, his smirk returning. "Looks like our time is up."

Riley swallowed hard. "What do you mean?"

Callum glanced at her, golden eyes glinting.

"Kieran's coming."

Riley's breath caught.

And for the first time, she didn't know if that was a good thing.
###chapter 21: The Hunt Begins
The howl echoed through the ruins, low and haunting, vibrating deep in Riley's chest.

Kieran.

She didn't know how, but she could feel his presence closing in, the pull in her ribs tightening like an invisible thread stretched between them.

Callum exhaled, tilting his head like he was listening for something else. "I'd say we have about five minutes before he finds us."

Riley turned toward him, heart still hammering. "And what? You think I'm just going to stand here and wait?"

Callum's smirk was lazy, but his eyes were sharp. "Depends. Do you want answers, or do you want to run back to the same lies you've been living in?"

Riley gritted her teeth. "I don't trust you."

"Smart." His gaze flickered toward the sealed entrance. "But trust isn't the problem right now, is it?"

She hated that he was right.

The vines covering the doorway were unnatural, twisted in thick, unbreakable knots. The stone itself had shifted, closing over the exit like the ruin had come alive.

Because of her.

That part scared her the most.

Not Callum. Not Kieran's approaching footsteps in the distance.

But the truth that had slammed into her chest the moment she touched the ruin's energy.

This place responded to her.

Like it knew her.

Like it was waiting.

Riley took a shaky breath. "Then open it."

Callum blinked. "Excuse me?"

"The door." She pointed at the entrance. "You want me to believe you? Do you want me to 'wake up' or whatever cryptic nonsense you keep spouting? Then open it."

Callum studied her for a long moment, something unreadable passing through his golden gaze. Then he shrugged. "Alright."

He stepped toward the stone archway, raising a hand.

Nothing happened.

His smirk twitched. "Interesting."

Riley folded her arms. "Guess you're not as powerful as you think."

Callum turned back to her, raising an eyebrow. "I told you. This place isn't responding to me." His gaze flicked to her hands. "It's responding to you."

A cold knot formed in her stomach.

"No."

"Yes," he countered smoothly. "And there's only one way we're getting out of here."

Riley swallowed hard. "How?"

Callum took a slow step forward, voice dropping to something calm, coaxing. "You have to command it."

The air thickened.

Riley's breath turned shallow.

"No," she said quickly, shaking her head. "I don't know how."

Callum's gaze burned. "You do."

Her hands clenched at her sides. "And what if I can't?"

"Then I hope you're ready to explain to Kieran why you're locked in a room with me."

She glared at him.

But she knew he was right.

Riley turned toward the sealed entrance, her pulse roaring in her ears.

She had felt it before when the ruins reacted to her touch. A whisper of something old, something alive beneath the stone.

If she just reached for it

No.

She couldn't.

Could she?

Her fingers twitched.

She exhaled slowly, pressing her palm against the cold, unyielding surface.

Open.

Nothing happened.

Callum made a noise behind her. "You're hesitating."

"I am not"

"You're thinking like a human."

Riley whipped around. "Because I am one!"

Callum just smiled. "Are you?"

The words struck deeper than she wanted to admit.

Her hands shook as she turned back toward the stone.

This wasn't possible.

She wasn't this.

But the ruins knew her

Riley clenched her jaw, pulse roaring in her ears. The idea that this place was this ruin was answering her made her skin crawl.

She had spent her entire life not believing in things like fate, like destiny. But now?

Now she had to face the truth.

She took a slow, steadying breath.

This time, when she reached out, she didn't hesitate.

Her fingers pressed against the stone.

And she pushed.

Not physically.

But with something deeper.

Something buried.

The response was instant.

A low vibration rolled through the ruins, dust raining down from the ceiling. The vines shuddered, unraveling like loosened thread, stone groaning as the entrance peeled open.

The cool night air rushed in.

Riley staggered back, heart pounding.

She had done that.

Callum let out a low whistle. "Well, well."

She turned to him, breath still shaky. "What the hell am I?"

Callum's golden eyes gleamed. "You're waking up."

Before she could respond, footsteps crunched against the gravel outside.

Fast. Purposeful.

Riley turned just as Kieran appeared at the entrance.

His golden eyes flickered between her and Callum. Then, without missing a beat, he growled,

"What the hell is going on?"

Kieran stood rigid, his entire body humming with tension.

His golden eyes locked on Callum, rage burning beneath the surface.

Riley had seen him angry before.

But this?

This was different.

Callum, of course, looked completely unbothered.

He leaned casually against the stone, arms folded, smirk firmly in place. "You're late."

Kieran's jaw tightened. "You shouldn't be here."

"Neither should she," Callum countered smoothly, nodding toward Riley. "But here we are."

Riley stepped between them. "Stop."

Kieran's gaze snapped to her.

Something flickered in his expression. Relief. Concern. Something else.

"Are you okay?" he asked, his voice lower now, more controlled.

Riley hesitated.

She should say yes.

She should lie.

But the truth was still pressing against her ribs, still thrumming in her blood.

"I"

"She opened the ruins," Callum cut in.

Kieran's entire body stiffened.

His gaze whipped back to Riley. "You what?"

She swallowed hard. "I didn't mean to."

Kieran took a step closer like he needed to see for himself. "How?"

Riley clenched her jaw. "I don't know."

But that wasn't entirely true.

She had felt something, had reached for something, and the ruins had answered her.

And from the way Kieran was looking at her now

He knew exactly what that meant.

His golden eyes darkened.

"You shouldn't have done that."

Anger flared inside her. "I didn't have a choice!"

"You always have a choice," Kieran shot back, voice sharper now.

Something about the way he said it like he knew what it was like to choose wrong made her chest tighten.

But Callum just sighed. "Alright, as fun as this little reunion is, we should go."

Kieran turned to him, voice deadly calm. "You're not going anywhere with her."

Callum smirked. "That's not your decision."

Riley stepped forward. "No. It's mine."

They both looked at her.

Riley exhaled. She needed time to think. To figure out what the hell was happening to her.

She glanced at Callum. "Go."

Callum raised an eyebrow. "You sure?"

Riley nodded. "I'll find you when I'm ready."

Callum held her gaze for a long moment. Then he nodded. "Try not to let him get too attached."

And with that, he was gone.

Riley turned back to Kieran, chest still aching.

But before she could say anything, Kieran spoke first.

His voice was quiet. Careful.

"What did you see in there?"

Riley hesitated.

Because she had a feeling Kieran already knew.

She met his gaze.

And whispered,

"The truth."

And she wasn't sure she was ready for it.

Riley's breath came in short, uneven gasps as the weight of everything pressed down on her. The truth she had seen the truth she had felt wasn't something she could shove aside. It wasn't something she could run from.

Not anymore.

Kieran took a slow step forward, his golden eyes dark and unreadable. "Riley."

Her gaze snapped up to his.

There was something dangerous in the way he said her name. Not anger. Not relief.

Fear.

And that scared her more than anything.

She forced herself to swallow, her throat tight. "What?"

Kieran's jaw clenched. His shoulders were tense like he was holding something back. "What exactly did you see?"

Riley hesitated.

Because how could she even put it into words?

That she had seen herself standing on a battlefield long before she was ever born? That she had heard voices whispering her name, the name she wasn't sure belonged to her anymore? That when she touched the ruins, something had answered like it had been waiting for her to return?

She shook her head. "I don't" She stopped herself. Lying wouldn't help. Not now.

"I saw" She exhaled sharply, hands curling into fists. "I saw a place like this. Before it was ruined. It was whole."

Kieran's expression didn't change.

But the air around him did.

It grew thicker. More charged.

Like he had felt something too.

Riley noticed the subtle shift in his stance the way his fingers twitched at his sides, how his throat bobbed like he was swallowing something bitter.

He already knew.

The realization hit her like a punch.

She narrowed her eyes. "You've seen it too, haven't you?"

Kieran didn't answer.

But he didn't have to.

His silence told her everything.

Her chest ached. "How long have you known?"

Kieran exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "It's complicated."

Riley let out a bitter laugh. "Right. Of course, it is."

She turned away, pacing, anger curling in her ribs like a storm cloud. "Everyone knows something about me except me. Callum, Tobias, even you." She whirled back to face him. "What the hell am I, Kieran?"

His golden eyes darkened. "I don't know."

It was too fast. Too automatic.

A lie.

Riley's pulse spiked. "Bullshit."

Kieran's jaw tightened. "Riley"

"No." She stepped closer, her breath sharp. "Tell me the truth. Stop protecting me. Stop lying to me. If I was part of all this before if I was" She hesitated, the words almost too impossible to say. "If I was someone else, then I need to know."

Something flickered in Kieran's expression.

Something haunted.

Riley stared at him, her heart pounding. "You knew me before, didn't you?"

Silence.

Kieran's gaze lowered, his fists clenching at his sides.

And that was all the answer she needed.

Her stomach twisted.

Oh, god.

"You did," she whispered. "Didn't you?"

Kieran didn't move.

He didn't deny it.

He just stood there, the moonlight casting long shadows across his face, making him look less like the boy she had met a few weeks ago and more like something out of a dream.

Or a nightmare.

Riley's breath hitched. "Then why didn't you tell me?"

Kieran finally met her gaze. "Because I don't know how this ends."

Her body went cold.

"What does that mean?"

Kieran hesitated, his expression torn between a thousand things he wasn't saying.

Then, softly almost too softly he said,

"It means that last time, it didn't end well."

The words hit her like a punch.

Last time.

Her legs felt weak.

She backed away, shaking her head. "No."

Kieran reached for her, his voice urgent now. "Riley"

"No," she snapped. "You're telling me I've done this before? That you've known me before?" Her breath was coming too fast, her heart slamming against her ribs. "How many times? Once? Twice? More?"

Kieran stayed silent.

Her pulse stopped.

He wasn't answering.

Because he didn't have to.

Because she already knew.

This wasn't the first time.

This was just the first time she had remembered.

Her lungs seized, panic curling like smoke inside her chest.

"I need to go." The words rushed out before she could stop them.

Kieran's eyes flashed. "Riley, wait"

But she was already moving, spinning on her heel and storming toward the trees.

She needed to get out of here.

She needed space.

She needed to breathe.

Because if this was true if Kieran had known before, if she had been someone else then what else was hidden inside her?

What else was waiting to wake up?

And what had happened last time to make Kieran so afraid of this ending the same way?

Her hands trembled as she disappeared into the darkness.

And for the first time, she wasn't sure she wanted the answers.

Because something told her

She wouldn't like them.
###chapter 22: Run Until You Break
The forest swallowed Riley whole.

The ruins, the truth, Kieran all of it blurred into the background as she ran.

She didn't know where she was going.

She just knew she had to get away.

The cold night air burned her lungs. The sharp scent of pine and damp earth curled around her, the leaves crunching beneath her boots as she pushed forward, faster, farther.

She didn't think so.

She didn't want to think.

Because if she stopped running, if she let herself feel the weight of what Kieran had just told her

She wasn't sure she'd be able to breathe again.

I've done this before.

The words rattled in her skull, over and over.

Kieran hadn't said how many times.

He hadn't said what happened before.

But she had seen it in his eyes. The hesitation.

Whatever had happened in the past, it had ended badly.

And he thought it was happening again.

She pushed herself harder, branches whipping against her skin.

The forest pulsed around her, every shadow stretching too far, every sound too sharp. It was alive. Watching. Waiting.

And deep down, Riley knew

She wasn't running alone.

Something was chasing her.

The pull in her ribs the invisible thread connecting her to Kieran grew tighter.

No.

No, it wasn't Kieran.

This was something else.

Something is wrong.

The air shifted.

The night breathed.

And then

A growl.

Low. Deep. Too close.

Riley's heart slammed into her ribs.

She didn't slow down.

Didn't look back.

But she felt it.

Something big moved behind her, the ground shaking beneath its weight.

A predator.

Hunting her.

Her pulse roared in her ears.

Kieran had said she shouldn't have opened the ruins.

Had she woken something up?

The thought clawed at her, but she couldn't stop not now.

The thing behind her moved fast. Too fast. The ground trembled beneath its weight, leaves scattering as it gained on her.

She had to think.

Had to find a way out.

But the trees stretched on forever, the darkness thick and suffocating. Every time she turned, every time she veered left or right, the forest only seemed to pull her deeper.

A trap.

She was running straight into a trap.

Her breath came in ragged gasps as she pivoted sharply, trying to shake it.

But the growls only grew louder.

Closer.

The pull in her chest the connection she didn't understand tightened, like an invisible noose.

Then

A shape lunged from the shadows.

Massive.

Teeth gleaming in the slivers of moonlight.

Riley barely had time to react before the creature slammed into her.

She hit the ground hard, her body skidding through the dirt and leaves. Pain shot through her ribs, her vision blurring.

She rolled, gasping, forcing herself up.

And finally, she saw it.

Not a wolf.

Not a werewolf.

Something worse.

It stood on four limbs, but its body was all wrong too long, too twisted. Its skin was stretched taut over sinewy muscle, its mouth too wide, teeth too sharp.

Not natural.

Not supposed to exist.

Its eyes were dark, endless pits locked onto hers.

And when it spoke, its voice was not its own.

It was hers.

"You don't remember me but I remember you."

Riley's breath hitched.

No.

No, this wasn't real.

It took a slow step forward, claws digging into the dirt.

"I've been waiting for you, Riley."

Her blood ran cold.

Because even though she had never seen this creature before, even though every part of her screamed to run

Somewhere, deep inside, she knew it.

And it knew her.

She scrambled backward, her heart slamming against her ribs. "Stay away from me."

The thing laughed.

A horrible, distorted sound.

"But you called me here."

Riley's stomach twisted.

She had woken it up.

The ruins. The energy.

This thing had been waiting for her to return.

And now?

It wasn't going to let her go.

The creature lunged.

Riley barely had time to react before something else crashed into it.

A blur of motion.

A snarl deep, furious.

Kieran.

He hit the creature hard, claws slashing across its side, sending it reeling. It snarled, its skin twisting, writhing.

Kieran landed between them, golden eyes blazing.

His voice was low, dangerous.

"Run."

But Riley didn't move.

She couldn't.

Because deep in her chest, the connection between them burned.

Not with fear.

Not with panic.

With recognition.

And she wasn't sure if it was for Kieran

Or for the thing trying to kill them both.

Riley's pulse thundered as she stared at the creature that had spoken with her voice.

She wanted to believe it was just a monster. Just another threat in the endless nightmare she had fallen into.

But something deep in her chest, something buried in the cracks of her memories, whispered otherwise.

You know what it is.

You've seen it before.

You've fought it before.

The creature growled, shifting its weight as it locked its abyssal eyes on Kieran. Its twisted mouth curled into something like a smile.

"Ah the loyal one."

Kieran's entire body went still.

Riley saw the way his muscles tensed, the way his breath hitched just for a second. Recognition.

Not just from her.

From him.

He knew it, too.

A chill coiled down her spine.

Before she could speak, the creature lunged.

Kieran met it head-on, colliding in a blur of claws and snapping teeth. They crashed through the underbrush, snarling, the air thick with the sound of tearing flesh and breaking branches.

Riley's breath caught.

She should run.

She should.

But her feet wouldn't move.

Because some part of her knew

This wasn't just a fight.

It was unfinished business.

And somehow, she was at the center of it.

The realization rooted her to the spot, even as Kieran and the creature tore into each other, their bodies a blur of snarling fury and flashing claws.

This wasn't just about her being marked.

It wasn't about Kieran protecting her, or Callum pushing her toward some greater truth.

This nightmare-given form was here because of her.

Because of who she had been.

The weight of that truth settled deep in her chest, suffocating.

Kieran let out a sharp snarl of pain, staggering back as the creature's claws raked across his side. Blood splattered onto the leaves, dark against the moonlight.

Something in Riley snapped.

She didn't think so.

Didn't hesitate.

She moved.

Before she could second-guess it, she grabbed the nearest broken branch and lunged, driven by an instinct she didn't understand.

The creature turned just as she thrust the jagged wood into its side.

For a moment, everything stopped.

The thing froze, its abyssal eyes snapping to hers.

And then it laughed.

"Still fighting, even now?" it whispered.

Riley's blood ran cold.

Because the way it said it

Like it had been waiting for her to do exactly that.
###chapter 23: The Ghosts We Carry
The creature laughed.

A sound that didn't belong in this world warped, stretched, wrong.

"Still fighting, even now?"

Riley's grip on the branch tightened, her heart hammering against her ribs. It was watching her, not as prey, not as a girl who had made a reckless decision but as something it recognized.

Somehow, that was worse.

Kieran snarled, moving fast. He grabbed Riley's wrist, yanking her back just as the creature's clawed hand lashed out. The force of it tore the branch from her grip, snapping it in half like it was nothing.

"We need to go," Kieran growled, keeping his body between her and the thing that had spoken with her voice.

The creature tilted its head, almost thoughtful. "Yes, run. Just like before."

Riley's stomach twisted.

She wasn't sure what was worse: the mockery in its tone or the heavy, sick feeling in her chest that told her this thing wasn't lying.

Kieran moved before she could. His hand found her arm, his grip tight but not cruel. "Now."

She didn't argue.

Didn't hesitate.

Because for the first time since she had stepped into the ruins, she realized

She wasn't ready for the truth.

Not yet.

So she ran.

Into the Dark

The wind whipped through the trees, biting Riley's skin as she and Kieran tore through the forest.

The sound of pursuit never came.

No pounding footsteps.

No sharp growls.

Nothing.

That was almost worse.

Kieran didn't slow down, didn't look back. His grip on her arm was firm, guiding her through the twisting maze of trees with a certainty that should have been impossible.

"How do you know where you're going?" she asked breathlessly, dodging a low-hanging branch.

Kieran's jaw tightened. "Because I know what's out here."

She almost asked what that meant.

Almost.

But she wasn't sure she wanted the answer.

They ran until her legs burned and her lungs ached.

Until the ruins were far behind them.

Then, mercifully Kieran pulled them to a stop.

Riley bent forward, hands on her knees, gasping for breath. "What the hell was that?"

Kieran's golden eyes burned in the dim moonlight. "Something that shouldn't exist."

Riley let out a harsh, bitter laugh. "Well, that makes two of us, doesn't it?"

Kieran flinched.

It was barely there but she saw it.

She straightened, pulse still too fast, body still too wired from the run, from the fight, from the truth pressing against the edges of her mind. "Tell me what's going on, Kieran."

He ran a hand through his dark, messy hair, exhaling sharply. "I don't know."

It was a lie.

She could feel it in her bones.

"Try again."

He hesitated, the muscle in his jaw tightening. "That thing it's not part of the pack. It's not something Tobias controls. It's older."

Riley frowned. "How much older?"

Kieran's gaze flickered to hers. "As old as you."

Her stomach dropped.

"No," she whispered. "No, that's not possible."

But she thought of the ruins. The way they had recognized her. The way the creature had spoken her name was like a prayer and a curse all at once.

She shivered.

Kieran stepped closer, his golden eyes locked onto her. "I need you to tell me something."

Riley swallowed hard. "What?"

He hesitated.

Then softly "Did it say anything else?"

Her breath caught.

He already knew.

Her mind flashed back to the moment the creature's dark, hollow eyes had locked onto hers.

"Still fighting, even now?"

"You don't remember me but I remember you."

Riley clenched her fists. "It knew me."

Kieran closed his eyes, exhaling slowly.

It was like he had been waiting for this.

Like he had already known this was coming.

"Then it's happening again," he muttered.

A chill skittered down Riley's spine. "What is?"

Kieran didn't answer.

Instead, he took her hand.

Not forcefully.

Not like he was trying to control her.

But like he was asking her to trust him.

"Come with me."

Riley hesitated. "Where?"

"To someone who might have answers."

She studied him, searching his face for anything that told her she was making a mistake.

She found nothing.

Finally, she nodded. "Alright."

Kieran gave a small, almost imperceptible sigh of relief. Then he turned, leading her through the trees, deeper into the night.

Nova's Warning

The last thing Riley expected was for Kieran to take her to Nova.

They found her in a run-down gas station on the outskirts of town, sitting on the counter and eating from a bag of pretzels like she hadn't been up all night worrying.

The second Nova saw them, her eyes widened.

"Oh, thank god," she breathed, hopping down. "I thought you were dead."

Riley blinked. "I was gone for an hour."

"Yeah, well, an hour in Silverwood Time is a lifetime." Nova's sharp gaze flicked to Kieran. "Where did you take her?"

Riley opened her mouth, but Kieran cut in first. "She found the ruins."

Nova froze.

The color drained from her face. "You're kidding."

When neither of them said anything, she swore under her breath. "Riley, tell me you didn't"

"I didn't mean to," Riley snapped. "But apparently, they meant for me to find them."

Nova let out a long breath, rubbing her hands down her face. "Shit."

Riley crossed her arms. "Okay, what the hell is going on? You know something."

Nova exchanged a look with Kieran.

That was all it took.

Riley's patience snapped.

"Enough with the cryptic looks!" she snapped. "Tell me the truth, or I swear to god, I will"

"You're waking up," Nova said.

Riley stilled.

Nova hesitated, then continued, voice softer. "You're not just remembering, Riley. You're becoming something again. Something you were before."

Riley's chest tightened.

She thought of the ruins. The creature. The way the earth had answered her.

"No," she whispered. "That's not"

But she couldn't say it.

Because part of her already knew.

Nova's gaze softened. "I don't think we have a lot of time before you figure out what that means."

Riley shook her head, backing up. "I'm not"

A sharp pain sliced through her skull.

She gasped, stumbling back as a vision crashed into her like a thunderstorm.

Blood on the snow.

Golden eyes full of fury.

A voice her voice.

"This has to end."

The vision snapped away.

Riley collapsed onto her hands and knees, gasping.

Kieran was already there, grabbing her shoulders. "Riley."

She couldn't speak.

Couldn't move.

Because that vision

It hadn't been a memory.

It had been a warning.

Nova cursed. "We don't have time. Tobias is going to figure it out soon, and if he gets to her before we do"

"He won't," Kieran said firmly.

Riley blinked up at them, vision swimming.

And deep in her bones, she realized

Whatever she was before

She was becoming it again

And there was no stopping it.

The realization sank into her bones, heavy and inescapable.

She wasn't just remembering the past she was slipping into it.

Every second, every breath, she could feel the way her body moved differently, the way her instincts sharpened, the way the shadows in the room felt closer than they should have.

Kieran's grip on her tightened, steadying her. "Riley, look at me."

She forced her gaze up, meeting his golden eyes.

There was something there, not fear. Don't panic.

Something worse.

Recognition.

Because he had seen this before.

And if he was afraid now, it wasn't for himself.

It was for her.

Nova swallowed hard. "We have to move."

Riley exhaled, her heart pounding.

She didn't know where they were going.

Didn't know what she was becoming.

But she knew one thing.

She wasn't running anymore.
###chapter 24: A Monster’s Shadow
Riley wasn't running anymore.

But she had no idea what she was walking toward.

The air in the gas station felt too heavy, too thick like the whole world had shifted slightly off its axis.

Nova paced near the grimy counter, chewing on the sleeve of her hoodie. Kieran stood by the door, arms crossed, golden eyes unreadable.

And Riley?

She just existed in the space between them, feeling like a stranger in her own body.

She could still hear the creature's voice.

"You don't remember me but I remember you."

She could still feel the ruins under her fingers, answering her.

Not just a memory.

A warning.

She had thought that walking away from the ruins, from Callum, from that thing in the forest, would bring her clarity.

Instead, all she had was more questions.

She exhaled sharply. "Someone better start talking."

Nova stopped pacing. "About what?"

Riley snapped her gaze to her. "Don't play dumb with me."

Kieran cut in before Nova could respond. "She's right. We're out of time." His voice was low, controlled. "Tobias won't wait forever. He knows something's changing. He knows Riley isn't" He trailed off like he wasn't sure how to finish the sentence.

Riley's chest tightened.

She wasn't what?

Human?

Normal?

Safe?

Nova sighed, running a hand through her wild blonde curls. "Okay, fine. You want the truth?" She turned to Riley, arms crossed. "You're not the first person to see that thing in the woods."

Riley's pulse stumbled. "What?"

Nova nodded. "There are stories. Not just werewolves about something else. A shadow in the woods. A hunter. A ghost."

Kieran tensed. "It's not a ghost."

Nova ignored him. "Whatever it is, it's been in Silverwood for a long time. People see it. And then they disappear."

A chill crawled down Riley's spine.

She swallowed. "Disappear?"

Nova hesitated. "Or worse."

The words hung in the air, heavy and cold.

Riley didn't know what was worse, that there was something older than the werewolves hunting in the woods, or that it had been waiting for her.

She turned to Kieran. "And you? How much do you know?"

Kieran's golden eyes flickered. "Enough."

Riley stepped closer. "Enough to lie to me?"

Kieran exhaled slowly. "I never lied to you, Riley."

"Not telling me something is still lying." Her voice was sharp, edged with something she couldn't quite name.

Kieran held her gaze, silent.

That was enough to answer.

Riley took a slow breath, forcing herself to focus. "Alright. Then here's what I do know." She counted on her fingers.

"One I opened the ruins, and something woke up."

"Two It recognized me."

"Three It recognized you."

Kieran's jaw tensed.

Bingo.

Riley narrowed her eyes. "That thing wasn't just talking to me, was it?"

Nova glanced between them, frowning. "Wait. It recognized Kieran, too?"

Kieran said nothing.

But the look on his face

He knew.

And Riley was done waiting for answers.

She closed the distance between them, forcing Kieran to meet her gaze. "Tell me the truth. Right now."

Kieran's throat bobbed.

Then, softly too softly he said, "I've seen it before."

The words hit her like a knife to the ribs.

Riley stumbled back, shaking her head. "No. That's not possible."

But deep down, she knew it was.

Kieran's voice was quiet, careful. "I didn't know what it was. Not at first. The pack doesn't talk about it. But I saw it when I was a kid once. Just a glimpse." His golden eyes darkened. "And I never forgot it."

Riley's skin prickled.

It had been here before her.

It had been waiting.

Waiting for her to come back.

Her breathing turned shallow. "Why me?"

Kieran hesitated.

Then he said something that made her blood turn to ice.

"It's not hunting you, Riley."

She frowned. "Then what"

Kieran's gaze burned.

"It's following you."

The world tilted.

Riley took a step back, legs shaking. "No."

Kieran didn't move. "I think you brought it here."

The words landed like a strike of lightning.

She wanted to deny it. Wanted to scream that he was wrong.

But the memories in her head, the ruins, the whispers, the pull in her chest told her otherwise.

She had woken it up.

Because it had been waiting for her.

Because it had been here all along.

Nova let out a slow, shaky breath. "Okay. That's officially the most terrifying thing I've ever heard."

Riley didn't speak.

Couldn't speak.

If this was true

If she had brought it here

Then she wasn't just part of the story.

She was the reason it existed at all.

The Plan

The gas station was silent for a long time.

Then, finally, Kieran straightened. "We need to leave."

Riley frowned. "And where?"

"To someone who might have answers."

Nova let out a bitter laugh. "And who the hell would that be? Because last I checked, the pack wants Riley dead, Callum is playing some weird long game, and the thing in the woods is" She hesitated. "Yeah, no. We're screwed."

Kieran shot her a look. "Not necessarily."

Nova blinked. "Do you have a plan?"

Kieran sighed. "Not exactly. But I know someone who might."

Riley frowned. "Who?"

Kieran hesitated.

Then he said a name that made the room feel colder.

"Elias Rowe."

Nova swore under her breath. "You're kidding."

Riley glanced between them. "Who's Elias Rowe?"

Nova groaned. "Only the most paranoid, unhinged werewolf that ever lived."

Kieran ignored her. "He was exiled years ago. No one knows where he went. But he knew things about the pack things Tobias didn't want getting out."

Riley crossed her arms. "And you think he knows about the thing in the woods?"

Kieran exhaled. "I think he knows about you."

Riley's stomach twisted.

Great.

Another person who knew more about her past than she did.

Nova sighed. "Fine. Let's say we find Elias. What's the plan? We just ask him for help?"

Kieran's jaw tightened. "Something like that."

Riley didn't like the sound of that.

Not one bit.

But what choice did she have?

The pack was closing in.

Callum was waiting for her to make her next move.

And the thing in the woods

It wasn't done with her yet.

Riley clenched her fists. "Alright. Let's find him."

Kieran gave a sharp nod.

Nova groaned. "I'm gonna regret this."

And with that, they walked out into the night.

Straight toward the next piece of the puzzle 

Straight toward the next monster.

Riley didn't know what terrified her more, the thing in the woods, or the ghosts of her past.

She followed Kieran and Nova into the cold night, her breath coming fast, sharp. The weight of everything pressed against her ribs the ruins, the visions, the creature that knew her.

And now, Elias Rowe.

Another name tied to a story she didn't remember living.

Kieran moved ahead, his body tense, watchful. Nova stuck close to Riley, muttering complaints under her breath, but Riley barely heard her.

The woods stretched on, endless and shifting, shadows flickering in her peripheral vision.

She didn't trust the dark anymore.

Not after tonight.

Not after waking something up.

A shiver crawled down her spine.

Somewhere, deep in the trees, something watched.

Riley felt it.

A presence. A whisper in the back of her mind.

Not human.

Not a wolf.

Something else.

Something waiting.

And this time, she wasn't sure she'd survive meeting it.
###chapter 25: The Exile’s Truth
  
The deeper they went into the forest, the heavier the air became.

The trees stood tall and silent, their branches twisting together like skeletal fingers, blocking out the moonlight. The only sounds were their footsteps and the distant hum of unseen creatures watching from the shadows.

Riley knew this wasn't just any part of the woods.

This was where the forgotten things lived.

Kieran moved ahead of her, muscles coiled tight, his golden eyes scanning the darkness. Nova was close behind, chewing on the sleeve of her hoodie a nervous habit she didn't bother hiding anymore.

And Riley?

She kept walking.

Even though her entire body screamed at her to turn back.

Because somewhere ahead, waiting for them in this forgotten stretch of forest, was Elias Rowe.

The exiled werewolf.

The man who might finally tell her who she was.

Or what she was becoming.

They found Elias just past midnight.

His cabin sat at the edge of a clearing, half-swallowed by the earth, its wooden walls weathered by time and neglect. Vines curled up the sides, wrapping around the roof like nature had tried to pull it underground and failed.

Smoke curled lazily from the crooked chimney. He was awake.

Kieran let out a slow breath. "Stay close to me."

Riley frowned. "Why?"

Before he could answer, the front door swung open.

And Elias stepped into the moonlight.

He wasn't what Riley expected.

No gray-haired recluse. No madman foaming at the mouth.

He was young.

Maybe twenty or twenty-one, his frame lean and sharp, all wiry muscle and restless energy. His dark hair hung in uneven strands over his forehead, and his pale blue eyes were too bright, too focused like he saw things that weren't there.

He leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, gaze flicking between them before settling on Riley.

Then he laughed.

"Well," he said, voice smooth, edged with something sharp. "I guess they weren't lying."

Riley's stomach tightened. "What?"

Elias's grin didn't fade. "You're real." His head tilted slightly, studying her. "I wasn't sure if you'd ever show up."

She felt Kieran tense beside her.

He took a single step forward. "You knew about her?"

Elias lifted an eyebrow. "You didn't?"

Kieran didn't respond.

Riley exhaled, forcing herself to ignore the way her skin prickled under Elias's stare. "You know who I am."

Elias's gaze flickered with something unreadable.

Then, softly too softly he  said,

"I know what you were."

The inside of the cabin smelled like smoke and rain and something bitter. Herbs hung from the rafters, dried and crumbling, and stacks of old books and maps were piled on every surface.

Elias dropped into a chair, kicking his feet up onto the nearest table.

"Go ahead, then," he said lazily. "Ask your questions."

Riley's nails dug into her palms. "What am I?"

Elias's smirk deepened. "Straight to the point. I like that."

Kieran growled, "Elias"

"Relax, pup." Elias waved him off, eyes never leaving Riley. "You're looking for the easy answer, but there isn't one. You weren't just some warrior, Riley."

Riley's pulse spiked.

"You were a goddamn legend."

Silence.

Nova made a choked sound. "Excuse me?"

Elias leaned forward, voice dropping to something almost conspiratorial. "The war didn't start because of the pack. It didn't start because of humans or hunters or some stupid territorial dispute."

He smiled.

It wasn't a kind smile.

"It started because of you."

Riley's lungs locked.

No.

No, that wasn't

"That's not possible," she whispered.

Elias's expression didn't change. "Doesn't matter if you believe it. It happened. And now?" His gaze darkened. "It's happening again."

The world tilted.

Riley backed up, shaking her head. "No. I"

"You woke up the ruins, didn't you?" Elias cut in. "You felt them respond to you. They only respond to you."

Her breath hitched.

Because he wasn't wrong.

Kieran took a step forward, his voice low, controlled. "If you know so much, tell us what's out there."

Elias didn't hesitate.

"The thing in the woods?" He exhaled. "That's the part of the story they erased."

Riley's stomach dropped.

"What do you mean?"

Elias glanced toward the fire, eyes distant. "There's something older than the pack. Older than Tobias, older than all of us."

He looked at her.

And for the first time since they'd arrived, his voice lost its amusement.

"You locked it away, Riley."

A chill crept up her spine.

"No," she whispered.

Elias nodded. "You did. And now it's free."

Riley's knees felt weak.

She stumbled back, but Kieran was already there, steadying her.

Elias watched them carefully. "You don't believe me?"

Riley shook her head. "I don't"

"Then tell me something." Elias leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "Why do you think it's following you?"

Riley's breath caught.

"I"

"Because it knows what you are," Elias murmured. "And it knows what you're becoming."

The fire crackled, sending shadows across the cabin walls.

And Riley realized something.

For the first time since this all started

She wasn't afraid of what was chasing her.

She was afraid of why it wanted her back.

Elias sighed, running a hand through his dark hair. "Look, I don't know what's gonna happen next, but I do know one thing."

Riley forced herself to breathe. "What?"

Elias met her gaze.

"Trust no one."

A strange chill settled in her chest.

Elias's eyes flicked toward Kieran, then to Nova.

"Not even the ones you love."

Something about the way he said it made Riley's blood go cold.

Because it wasn't just a warning.

It was a prediction.

Someone was going to betray her.

And the worst part?

She didn't know who.

The thought clawed at her, sinking deep into her ribs, and pressing against her already frayed nerves.

Nova and Kieran stood beside her, familiar, constant.

But Elias's words had already poisoned something inside her.

"Not even the ones you love."

Her fingers twitched at her sides.

She didn't love anyone. Not really.

Did she?

She didn't have time to dwell on it.

Elias rose from his chair, stretching lazily. "That's all I've got for you, princess. Take it or leave it."

Riley's jaw clenched. "That's not enough."

Elias smirked. "That's all you're getting."

Something about his tone sent a shiver down her spine.

Because it wasn't just a dismissal.

It was final.

Like this was the last time they'd see him.

Like he already knew what was coming.

She should have pressed him. Should have demanded more.

But before she could

A howl split the night.

Low. Long. Close.

Riley's breath caught.

Kieran cursed.

The pack had found them.

Elias sighed, unconcerned. "Welp. That's my cue."

And just like that, he was gone.

Riley barely had time to process it before Kieran grabbed her wrist, his grip tight, urgent.

"Run."

And this time

She did.
###chapter 26: The Alpha Strikes Back
The forest was alive with movement.

Riley sprinted through the trees, her heartbeat pounding louder than her footsteps. The howl that had shattered the night was still ringing in her ears low, deep, and unmistakable.

The pack had found them.

And this time, they weren't giving her another chance to escape.

Kieran was at her side, his grip on her wrist tight, guiding her through the maze of trees. Nova ran just behind them, muttering curses under her breath.

Elias was gone. Vanished like smoke.

And Riley didn't have time to care.

Branches tore at her skin, the underbrush thick and unforgiving. The moon flickered between the treetops, offering just enough light to see but it wasn't enough. Not when the pack was closing in.

Another howl rang out this one closer.

Riley swallowed hard. "Where are we going?"

Kieran didn't slow down. "Anywhere but here."

Nova let out a sharp breath. "That's a shitty plan!"

"Do you have a better one?" Kieran snapped.

Nova didn't answer.

Riley could hear the howls multiplying.

A warning. A signal.

They were surrounded.

Her stomach twisted.

She hadn't realized how far into the woods Elias's cabin had been. The deeper parts of Silverwood's forests weren't just dangerous.

They were cursed.

The locals had whispered about it for years, strange disappearances, shadows that moved when they shouldn't.

And now, Riley was running straight through the heart of it.

A low growl rumbled behind them.

Riley twisted, catching a glimpse of a dark shape moving too fast, too close.

One of Tobias's wolves.

And it wasn't alone.

Her breath caught. "They're right behind us."

Kieran cursed. "We need to"

A blur of motion.

Something slammed into him.

Kieran grunted as he was thrown sideways, crashing into the dirt.

"Shit!" Nova skidded to a stop.

Riley spun around, her chest tightening. Kieran was already getting up, blood dripping from his lip.

But the wolf that attacked him

It wasn't stopping.

It lunged again, claws flashing.

Riley moved without thinking.

She grabbed the nearest broken branch, swinging with everything she had.

It connected.

The wolf let out a sharp snarl, stumbling back just enough for Kieran to regain his footing.

His golden eyes flickered, dark with something sharp. "Keep moving."

Nova yanked Riley's sleeve. "We don't have time for this!"

More shadows were closing in.

The pack was too fast.

They couldn't outrun them.

Riley's mind raced. "We need to hide."

Kieran didn't hesitate. "I know a place."

They tore through the trees, Kieran leading them toward something Riley couldn't see.

Another howl rang out.

Then footsteps. Fast. Close.

Too close.

They weren't going to make it.

The moment she thought it, Kieran grabbed her wrist again, jerking her sharply to the right.

And suddenly

They weren't in the woods anymore.

They were in a barn.

The wooden walls pressed in around them, the air thick with dust and the scent of old hay. The barn was abandoned, a skeleton of what it once was.

Nova slammed the door behind them, breathlessly.

Kieran exhaled sharply, pressing his back against the wall. His side was bleeding.

Riley's stomach twisted.

"Kieran, you're hurt."

"I'm fine," he muttered.

"You're bleeding."

He shot her a look. "It happens."

Riley didn't believe him for a second.

The cut along his ribs was deep, a long jagged line that was already darkening with bruises.

Nova ran a hand through her hair, muttering under her breath. "That was way too close."

Kieran ignored her, glancing toward the cracks in the wooden wall. "They'll find us soon."

Riley frowned. "Then why stop here?"

Kieran exhaled. "Because we need a minute to think."

His golden eyes flickered toward Riley.

"And because we need to talk."

Riley crossed her arms. "About what?"

Kieran hesitated.

Then he said, softly too softly "What happened back there."

Riley's throat tightened.

She didn't want to talk about it.

Not about Elias.

Not about the thing in the woods.

Not about the fact that Kieran had known more than he let on.

Nova's gaze flickered between them. "You mean the part where Elias told Riley she started a war?"

Riley flinched.

Kieran's jaw tightened. "Yeah. That part."

Silence stretched between them.

Riley didn't know what to say.

Because if Elias was telling the truth if she was the reason for all of this

Then what did that mean for who she was now?

Kieran studied her carefully. "You don't believe him."

She hesitated. "I don't know."

Kieran sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. "I don't like him. I never did."

Nova huffed. "That's because he's a cryptic asshole."

Riley bit her lip. "But what if he's right?"

Kieran's golden eyes darkened.

Before he could answer

A wave of pain slammed into her.

Riley gasped, her knees buckling as something tore through her mind.

Not pain.

A memory.

She wasn't in the barn anymore.

She was somewhere else.

Somewhere cold.

A battlefield.

The snow was red with blood.

A boy with golden eyes lay at her feet, his breath shallow, his body broken.

And her voice, her old voice, was whispering something.

"This has to end."

The vision snapped away.

Riley crashed back into the present, her breath ragged.

Nova's voice was distant. "Riley?"

She couldn't speak.

Her hands were shaking.

Because she had recognized the boy in the vision.

Not just some stranger.

Not some enemy from the past.

It was Kieran.

And she had been the one standing over him.

The room was spinning.

Kieran reached for her. "Riley, what did you"

She jerked away.

"I need air," she gasped.

Then she stumbled out the door, into the night.

Her breath clouded in the cold air, her pulse racing.

Her hands curled into fists.

Kieran had been in her past.

And in that past, she had hurt him.

The realization hit her like a knife to the ribs.

Because if she had done it once

What was stopping her from doing it again?

She pressed a hand to her chest, feeling the ruins' power still humming under her skin.

She was changing.

And for the first time, she wasn't sure if she wanted to stop it.

She was changing.

And for the first time, she wasn't sure if she wanted to stop it.

The thought sent a sharp chill through her, but it didn't scare her the way it should have.

She had felt power in that vision certainty. A part of her that had known exactly what needed to be done.

And that part of her was waking up.

Behind her, the barn door creaked open.

Kieran.

She didn't turn around.

Didn't trust herself either.

He stepped closer, his presence warm against the cold air. "Riley." His voice was low, careful.

Like he already knew what she was thinking.

Her fingers twitched at her sides. "I saw something."

Kieran didn't speak.

Didn't push.

He was waiting.

Riley exhaled shakily.

And then, barely above a whisper like admitting it would make it real she said,

"I think I hurt you."

Kieran's breath hitched.

And for the first time since this started, she saw it

The fear in his eyes.

Not of her.

But of what she was remembering.
###chapter 27: A Taste for Blood
The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Kieran didn't speak.

Didn't deny it.

And that was worse than if he had.

Riley felt something cold and sharp dig into her ribs, twisting deep. The realization that she had hurt him in another life, another time settled in her bones like a sickness.

Her fingers curled into fists. "Tell me I'm wrong."

Kieran exhaled, running a hand through his dark hair. He wouldn't meet her eyes.

That was all the answer she needed.

She took a step back, her breath sharp. "I" She stopped herself, throat tightening. "How?"

Kieran's golden eyes flickered in the dim light. "It doesn't matter."

"The hell it doesn't." Her voice was sharper than she intended, raw with something she didn't want to name.

Kieran clenched his jaw. "You don't remember everything. And I'm not going to be the one to force you to."

Riley shook her head, frustration curling hot under her skin. "You can't keep protecting me from this."

Kieran's gaze snapped to hers, something dangerous and tired in the way he looked at her. "I'm not protecting you, Riley. I'm protecting myself."

Her breath caught.

Before she could respond, Nova's voice cut through the night.

"You guys might wanna stop arguing and get inside."

Riley turned to find Nova standing in the barn doorway, arms crossed, expression tight. "Unless, of course, you want to get ripped apart by Tobias's wolves."

The weight of those words settled in Riley's chest.

Right.

The pack was still hunting them.

Whatever had happened between her and Kieran, whatever she had done to him in another life, it didn't change the fact that Tobias was out there, closing in.

Kieran's expression shuttered, slipping back into something unreadable.

"Let's move."

Riley hesitated.

Then, with a last glance at him, she turned and followed Nova inside.

But the weight of what she had seen, of what she had felt in that memory, didn't fade.

And neither did the fear that, if it happened before

It could happen again.

Inside the Barn

Nova paced, chewing on the inside of her cheek. "Okay, so let's talk about the fact that we're completely screwed."

Kieran sighed, sinking into a wooden crate. His shirt was still stained with blood, though his wound had already begun to heal. "We need a plan."

Nova rolled her eyes. "No shit, Sherlock."

Riley barely heard them.

Her mind was still tangled in what she had seen.

Blood on the snow.

Kieran, broken at her feet.

Her voice, whispering, this has to end.

The images wouldn't leave her.

They clawed at the edges of her mind, slipping in between her breaths, curling into her ribs.

She swallowed hard. "What if Elias was right?"

Nova and Kieran both looked at her.

Nova frowned. "About what?"

Riley exhaled, forcing herself to meet their eyes. "About me."

Kieran's jaw tightened. "Don't."

"No, I need to say it." She clenched her fists. "What if I was the reason for all of this? What if I did start the war?"

Nova shifted uncomfortably. "I mean I wouldn't put it past you."

Kieran shot her a glare.

Nova shrugged. "What? You have a vibe."

Riley dragged a hand through her hair, frustration bubbling beneath her skin. "I don't want a vibe, Nova. I want answers."

Kieran exhaled slowly. "Then let's find them."

Riley looked at him, searching for something in his golden eyes.

For the first time, she wasn't sure she liked what she saw.

The night stretched on, thick with tension.

The barn was cold, the air heavy with the scent of dust and earth. Nova curled up in the hay, arms folded beneath her head.

Kieran stood by the open window, watching the trees.

And Riley?

She couldn't sleep.

Because something was wrong.

She could feel it, thrumming under her skin, curling into her veins like smoke and fire.

A hunger.

Deep, sharp, insatiable.

She shifted, fingers twitching.

Her mouth felt dry, her body restless, aching.

Like she needed something.

Something she couldn't name.

She pushed up onto her elbows, her breath unsteady.

Kieran didn't turn.

But his voice was low, careful.

"You feel it, don't you?"

Riley froze.

Her pulse spiked.

"Kieran" Her throat was dry. "What's happening to me?"

Kieran finally turned, his golden eyes dark with something she couldn't quite place. "You're waking up."

Riley's breath hitched.

It wasn't the first time she had heard those words.

Callum had said the same thing.

And she was starting to think he was right.

She pushed herself up fully, fingers digging into the hay beneath her. "I don't like this."

Kieran took a slow step closer, his voice gentle but firm. "You need to control it."

Riley clenched her jaw. "And if I can't?"

Kieran's gaze flickered.

And that's when she realized

He wasn't afraid of her losing control.

He was afraid of what she'd do if she didn't.

Her stomach twisted. "I need air."

She didn't wait for a response.

She shoved open the barn door and stepped into the cold night.

The Blood on Her Hands

The second she was outside, the hunger intensified.

She gasped, gripping her arms, her whole body trembling.

The trees whispered around her, the wind curling through the leaves like a voice she couldn't quite hear.

And then

She smelled it.

Blood.

Warm, rich, calling to her.

Her vision blurred, her breath coming faster.

The hunger inside her roared.

She moved before she could stop herself.

One step.

Two.

Then a rabbit.

Small, twitching, wounded.

Riley's body locked up.

The scent of blood was strong and intoxicating.

She swallowed hard. No.

But her fingers were already reaching.

Already moving.

She didn't know what she was doing until her hands were around its tiny body

Until she could feel its fragile, beating heart beneath her palms.

A sharp gasp tore from her lips.

She jerked back, stumbling away.

What the hell was wrong with her?

The rabbit bolted, disappearing into the brush.

Riley's hands shook.

She stared down at them, her breath unsteady.

No blood. No marks.

But the hunger was still there.

Still waiting.

Kieran's voice was quiet behind her.

"Now do you believe me?"

Riley closed her eyes.

Because she did.

She just wasn't sure she wanted to.

Because she did.

She just wasn't sure she wanted to.

Riley stood there, her breath unsteady, the cold night air biting at her skin.

The hunger hadn't left. It curled in her stomach, waiting. Watching. Like it was alive.

She pressed her shaking hands to her sides, willing herself to breathe. To be normal.

But normal was already gone.

Kieran stepped closer, his golden eyes dark and knowing. "This is just the beginning."

Riley let out a sharp, bitter laugh. "Great. Love that for me."

Kieran didn't smile.

Because they both knew what this meant.

The ruins had changed her.

The past was waking up inside her, piece by piece.

And the part of her that once ended a war?

It was coming back.

Riley exhaled shakily, staring into the darkness.

If she didn't stop this now

She wasn't sure she'd ever want to.
###chapter 28: The Betrayal
The hunger stayed with her long after the rabbit was gone.

Riley felt it under her skin, coiled tight, waiting.

She had thought stepping away from the barn, from Kieran's knowing eyes, would help. Maybe the cold air would clear her head.

It didn't.

It only made her realize how close she had come to losing herself.

She had wanted to crush that rabbit in her hands.

Not out of anger.

Not out of malice.

But because she had wanted to feel what it was like.

She pressed her fingers into her palms, nails digging into her skin.

She needed to stop this.

She needed to stop herself.

A crunch of leaves behind her.

Riley spun, her pulse spiking

Kieran.

He was watching her carefully, standing just a few feet away, his hands in his jacket pockets.

"You shouldn't be out here alone," he said. His voice was even, but there was something sharp in his eyes.

Like he knew exactly what had just happened.

Riley exhaled, forcing herself to stay calm. "I needed air."

Kieran stepped forward. "You needed control."

She flinched.

Because he was right.

Again.

She hated that he was always right.

She turned away from him, staring into the darkness of the trees. "You don't have to babysit me, Kieran."

"No," he said, voice low. "I don't."

But he was still here.

Still watching.

Because they both knew she wasn't safe anymore.

Not from Tobias.

Not from the pack.

Not even from herself.

The next day, they left the barn behind.

It wasn't safe to stay in one place for too long.

Tobias's wolves were hunting them.

They stuck to the deep woods, moving carefully. Nova was quiet, which wasn't like her.

Riley could tell she was scared.

She wasn't the only one.

The thing that had attacked Kieran was still out there. The creature that spoke in her voice.

She could feel it.

Like a whisper in the back of her mind, waiting for her to hear it.

They didn't speak much as they moved.

Not until they heard footsteps.

Not the pack. Not wolves.

Something else.

Riley stopped.

Kieran's body went tense. His golden eyes flickered toward the trees.

Then a shadow moved.

A figure stepped into view.

Callum.

Riley's stomach tightened.

Nova stiffened beside her. "Oh, hell no."

Callum raised his hands. "Easy." His smirk was intact, but there was something careful in the way he looked at Riley.

Like she was different now.

Like he knew something had changed.

Kieran moved before Riley could.

His body was a blur one second standing still, the next pinning Callum against a tree.

Callum let out a sharp breath, but he didn't fight back.

"You shouldn't be here," Kieran snarled.

Callum smirked. "Neither should you, Wolfe."

Riley's pulse pounded.

She stepped forward, ignoring the way Nova grabbed her sleeve to stop her. "Why are you here?"

Callum's golden eyes flicked to hers. "To help you."

Nova scoffed. "Yeah, I'll pass on that."

Riley ignored her, her gaze locked on Callum. "Help me how?"

Callum smirked. "By telling you what no one else will."

Kieran let out a low growl. "Riley, don't listen to him."

Callum exhaled sharply. "I'm not the enemy here."

"You work for Tobias," Kieran snapped.

Callum's smirk faltered.

"Not anymore."

Silence.

Riley studied him. "You're lying."

Callum met her gaze. "Am I?"

She hesitated.

Because he didn't sound like he was lying.

Nova muttered, "Riley, don't even think about it."

But Riley was thinking about it.

Because no matter how much she hated Callum, no matter how much she knew she shouldn't trust him

He knew things.

And she needed answers.

Desperately.

She took a step forward. "What do you know?"

Kieran's eyes flashed. "Riley"

She shot him a look. "I can handle myself."

Kieran didn't look convinced.

Callum smirked, straightening his jacket. "There's a place. A safe house. No wolves, no hunters. Just answers."

Riley frowned. "Answers to what?"

Callum's gaze darkened.

"To what you are."

Her pulse skipped.

Nova made a disgusted noise. "Oh, come on. You're falling for this?"

But Riley wasn't listening anymore.

Her mind was already racing.

Kieran had tried to protect her.

Nova had tried to distract her.

Elias had told her only pieces of the truth.

But no one had given her the full story.

And if Callum knew

She had to find out.

She turned back to Kieran. "I'm going."

His jaw tightened. "No, you're not."

Riley squared her shoulders. "Yes. I am."

Kieran's golden eyes burned. "You don't trust him."

"No," she admitted. "But I trust myself."

Kieran took a slow step forward. "I'm not letting you walk into a trap."

Riley lifted her chin. "Then come with me."

Kieran's breath hitched.

Callum grinned. "Oh, I like this plan."

Nova groaned. "Riley, this is a terrible idea."

Maybe it was.

Maybe this was the worst decision she had ever made.

But she was done waiting.

Done hiding.

Done being afraid of the truth.

She met Callum's gaze.

"Take me there."

Callum's smirk deepened.

And just like that

She had made her first mistake.

The safe house was in the old district, hidden between abandoned buildings and overgrown alleyways.

Riley should have known.

Should have felt the trap closing in.

But she had been too focused on the hunger in her chest, the burning need for answers.

She only realized something was wrong when Callum pulled open the door

And Tobias was waiting inside.

Riley's blood ran cold.

Kieran snarled, moving fast but wolves stepped out of the shadows, blocking the exit.

A trap.

A perfect, unavoidable trap.

Callum let out a mocking sigh. "You really should have seen this coming, Riley."

Her heart pounded.

Tobias smiled. "Welcome home."

"Welcome home."

Tobias's words slithered through the air, wrapping around Riley like chains.

She couldn't move.

The room was too small, the walls pressing in. Wolves lurked in the corners watching, waiting.

Her gaze snapped to Callum.

"You" Her voice shook with fury.

Callum smirked, leaning against the doorframe. "What? You thought I turned against Tobias?" He let out a mock sigh. "Riley, you wound me."

Betrayal burned through her like wildfire.

She had walked into this.

She had let this happen.

Kieran was breathing hard, his golden eyes locked on Tobias, rage flickering beneath the surface.

Riley swallowed, forcing her voice to stay steady. "What do you want?"

Tobias's smile didn't fade. "The same thing I've always wanted."

His gaze darkened.

"You."

Riley's stomach twisted.

Because for the first time, she wasn't sure if he meant to kill her

Or use her.

Tobias stepped forward, his wolves closing in.

Riley's pulse roared in her ears.

There was no running.

No escaping.

The trap had snapped shut.

And this time, she wasn't sure she would make it out alive.
###chapter 29: The Trap
The walls felt like they were closing in.

Riley's pulse thundered in her ears as she took in every detail of the room the wolves surrounding them, the smirk on Callum's face, the dangerous calm in Tobias's golden eyes.

She had walked straight into a trap.

And now?

There was no way out.

Kieran shifted beside her, his entire body coiled like a spring, muscles tense, ready to fight.

It wouldn't matter.

They were outnumbered. Four-to-one, at least.

Nova wasn't here.

Elias was gone.

And Riley?

She had been too desperate for answers.

Tobias tilted his head, studying her. "You look surprised."

Riley clenched her jaw. "Maybe I expected you to try a little harder."

Callum let out a low laugh. "She's got jokes. That's cute."

Riley barely looked at him. "You're an idiot if you think I won't kill you for this."

Callum smirked, unconcerned. "Oh, I don't doubt you'll try."

Tobias sighed, stepping closer. "Enough. We're past the threats, Riley."

Her chest tightened.

Because Tobias wasn't looking at her like prey.

He was looking at her like she was something valuable.

Like she was a prize.

She hated it.

Kieran shifted, his golden eyes burning. "Let her go."

Tobias laughed. "And why would I do that?"

Kieran's voice was low, controlled but barely. "Because if you don't, I'll rip your throat out."

The wolves in the room bristled, low growls rippling through the air.

Tobias?

He just looked amused.

"You always were predictable, Wolfe." He exhaled sharply. "That's why you lost the first time."

Riley's breath caught.

Kieran froze.

Just for a second.

But Tobias saw it.

And he smiled. "Ah. She doesn't know, does she?"

Kieran's jaw tightened. "That's not your business."

Tobias ignored him, turning back to Riley. "You're remembering, aren't you?"

Riley forced herself to breathe. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Tobias chuckled. "Liar."

Riley's fingers twitched.

Because he was right.

She was remembering.

Not all of it. Not enough.

But pieces.

Kieran is bleeding in the snow.

Her voice whispered This has to end.

The look in Kieran's eyes was like he knew exactly what she had done.

Tobias smiled. "I bet you're wondering what happened, aren't you? Why does Kieran look at you like he's waiting for a knife in the back."

Kieran tensed beside her.

Riley didn't look away from Tobias.

But she could feel Kieran's breathing change.

Like Tobias had struck a nerve.

Tobias continued. "You were supposed to kill him."

The words hit like a punch.

Riley's lungs locked.

"What?" she whispered.

Tobias tilted his head. "You don't remember that part?"

Her stomach twisted.

The memory of the vision she had seen in the barn flashed behind her eyes.

Kieran.

On the ground.

Dying.

She had been the one standing over him.

And the worst part?

She hadn't felt regret.

Riley swallowed hard, her nails digging into her palms. "You're lying."

Tobias's smirk deepened. "Am I?"

She turned to Kieran.

And the look on his face

The hesitation. The guilt.

She took a step back.

"Kieran?" Her voice shook. "Tell me he's lying."

Silence.

It was the longest second of her life.

Kieran's golden eyes met hers, his jaw tight, his breath uneven.

And then softer than a whisper:

"I can't."

Riley's stomach dropped.

She felt sick.

The memories weren't lies.

They were real.

She had been the one to hurt him.

And he had known the whole time.

Tobias's voice was smug. "There it is."

Riley barely heard him.

Everything inside her was too loud, too sharp.

Kieran had known.

And he hadn't told her.

Tobias sighed dramatically. "Well, now that that's out of the way"

Riley snapped.

She moved without thinking, lunging for Tobias.

A blur of motion.

A snarl.

Something slammed into her.

Callum.

They hit the ground hard, Callum pinning her down before she could reach Tobias.

She let out a furious snarl, writhing beneath him, fighting his grip.

"Easy there, sweetheart," Callum breathed, smirking down at her. "We haven't even gotten to the fun part."

Riley's vision went red.

She kicked out, knocking him off balance long enough to shove him away.

She rolled to her feet

Just as Tobias sighed.

"Enough."

The wolves moved at once.

A blur of bodies, of golden eyes and snarling teeth.

Kieran lunged forward, meeting them head-on.

And the room exploded into chaos.

Kieran moved like a storm, tearing into the nearest wolves with lethal precision.

Riley barely had time to react before one of them was on her.

She ducked, spinning away just in time to avoid a swipe of claws.

She lashed out with her elbow bone cracking against her jaw.

A snarl.

The wolf staggered but didn't go down.

Riley didn't hesitate.

She grabbed the nearest wooden chair and swung hard.

It shattered against the wolf's side, sending it crashing to the floor.

She turned just in time to see Kieran get tackled.

"No!"

She moved without thinking.

Her hands burned, the hunger inside her roaring to the surface.

She reached out and something happened.

The wolf staggered back, gasping.

Riley froze.

Her fingers tingle.

The wolf was choking.

But she wasn't touching it.

She wasn't doing anything.

Was she?

The wolf collapsed.

Dead.

Riley stared at her hands.

What the hell

"Riley!"

Kieran's voice snapped her back.

She turned.

Tobias was standing in the middle of the room, watching her.

Not angry.

Not afraid.

Amused.

"Interesting," he murmured.

Riley's breath came fast, sharp.

Her hands shook.

Something was wrong with her.

Something was changing.

And she wasn't sure she could stop it.

Tobias smiled.

Then

"Take them."

Darkness

Something slammed into the back of her skull.

Riley fell.

And the world went black.

Darkness swallowed her.

Her body collapsed before she even felt the pain. A heavy numbness spread through her limbs, dull and distant like she was floating outside of herself.

Somewhere in the haze, she heard Kieran shouting her name.

A snarl.

A struggle.

Then a sickening crack.

Silence.

Her thoughts blurred, slipping between what was real and what wasn't. The hunger that had burned inside her dimmed, replaced by something else.

Something colder.

Something waiting.

A voice familiar, distant.

"You're not ready yet."

Then nothing.

A sharp jolt dragged her back.

Pain seared through her skull, pulling her toward consciousness.

Her breath hitched.

She was moving.

Or rather being moved.

The scent of damp earth and blood filled her senses.

Leather straps bit into her wrists.

Riley's pulse spiked.

Her vision swam as she forced her eyes open but the only thing she saw was shadows.

And then

A voice.

Smooth. Amused.

Tobias.

"Time to wake up, Riley."

And just like that

She realized she was no longer free.
###chapter 30: The Choice
The world swayed.

Riley's head throbbed as she came back to herself, her body heavy, slow. The numbness in her limbs was fading, replaced by a dull, aching pulse that crawled through her bones.

She was bound.

Leather straps dug into her wrists and ankles, securing her to a cold metal chair. The air around her was damp and thick with the scent of blood, earth, and something old.

Her vision swam as she blinked hard, forcing herself to focus.

Stone walls. Dim torchlight. Shadows flickering across the uneven ground.

Underground.

She wasn't in the safe house anymore.

A dungeon? A cellar? A tomb?

A slow clap broke the silence.

Riley's stomach twisted.

She knew that sound.

Tobias.

"Rise and shine," his voice drawled from somewhere beyond the flickering light. "I was beginning to think you'd sleep forever."

Riley's jaw tightened. "Funny. I was hoping this was all just a bad dream."

Tobias stepped into the light, his golden eyes gleaming with amusement.

"Dreams," he mused. "That's an interesting way to put it. You've been remembering things, haven't you?"

Riley forced her expression to stay blank. "Not really. You bore me to death every time I see you."

Tobias smirked.

"Still sharp. I like that."

He moved closer, circling her like a predator sizing up prey.

But Riley wasn't prey.

Not anymore.

She ignored the dull ache in her skull, the way the hunger inside her was stirring again.

"What do you want?" she demanded.

Tobias tilted his head. "What I've always wanted."

His smile curled.

"You."

Riley's pulse spiked.

Tobias sighed, pacing slowly. "You've been fighting it. Pushing away the truth. But you can feel it, can't you?" He gestured toward her. "The power inside you. The hunger."

Riley stayed silent.

Because he wasn't wrong.

And that terrified her.

Tobias leaned in slightly, voice dropping. "Do you want to know why you feel like this?"

Riley swallowed hard. "Not particularly."

He ignored her.

"You weren't just part of the war, Riley. You were the weapon."

Her breath caught.

Tobias's eyes gleamed. "It wasn't the wolves who started it. It wasn't the humans. It was you."

"No."

She didn't realize she had spoken until she heard her voice.

But Tobias just smiled. "Yes."

The images flashed through her mind before she could stop them.

Blood on the snow.

Golden eyes, filled with rage.

A promise. A betrayal. A war.

The ruins. The creature.

The hunger inside her.

Riley clenched her fists. "Why would I believe anything you say?"

Tobias sighed. "Because it's the truth."

He crouched slightly, leaning closer. "And deep down, you already know it."

Riley refused to look away.

She wouldn't let him get inside her head.

But something dark and ancient inside her whispered that he was right.

Tobias studied her, almost thoughtfully.

Then softly he said, "Do you want to see for yourself?"

Riley frowned. "What?"

Tobias's smirk returned. "You've only seen glimpses, haven't you? Pieces. Half-truths."

He straightened, pacing again. "What if I could give you everything? The full truth. Your truth."

Riley's stomach tightened.

Because she wanted that.

She needed that.

She was tired of the missing pieces.

But she didn't trust him.

Tobias saw her hesitation and smiled. "No tricks. No mind games. Just the truth."

Riley swallowed. "What's the catch?"

Tobias's eyes darkened.

"You accept who you are."

The words curled around her ribs, sinking in like hooks.

The hunger inside her stirred.

Tobias saw it.

He knew.

And that's why he wasn't forcing her hand.

She had to choose this.

Riley's breath came fast, uneven.

If she said yes

If she let him unlock whatever was inside her

Would she be able to stop it?

Would she even want to?

Kieran's voice echoed in her mind.

"You need to control it."

Her stomach twisted.

She couldn't trust Tobias.

But she also couldn't trust herself.

Riley closed her eyes, trying to steady her pulse.

And then

The door slammed open.

A blur of motion.

Kieran.

His golden eyes burned as he ripped through the wolves, claws flashing.

Tobias barely reacted.

He sighed. "Of course."

Riley's heart leaped into her throat.

Kieran was bleeding, but he didn't stop.

His eyes locked on hers.

And for the first time, she saw something in them she hadn't before.

Desperation.

Riley yanked at her bindings, trying to free herself. "Kieran"

Tobias moved.

Faster than she expected.

He was on Kieran in a second.

The two wolves collided, the air cracking with the force of it.

Kieran snarled, swinging hard.

Tobias dodged effortlessly.

"Still so predictable," he muttered, shoving Kieran into the wall.

Riley struggled against the restraints, panic rising.

She needed to move.

She needed to stop this.

Tobias grabbed Kieran by the throat, slamming him into the stone.

Kieran gasped.

Tobias leaned in, voice cold. "You should've stayed gone, Wolfe."

Riley saw the moment Kieran's body went slack.

No.

No.

Something inside her snapped.

The hunger roared to life.

Her vision blurred.

Her skin burned.

Tobias turned back to her, smirking.

And that was his mistake.

Because he had forgotten something.

She wasn't helpless.

She wasn't prey.

She was powerful.

The bindings shattered.

Riley stood.

Her body wasn't her own anymore.

It was something more.

Something ancient.

Tobias's eyes widened.

"Impossible," he breathed.

Riley smiled.

And then

She moved.

Faster than I thought.

Faster than instinct.

Faster than Tobias.

Her hand closed around his throat, lifting him off the ground.

Tobias choked, clawing at her grip.

Riley's breath was slow. Measured.

The hunger had been waiting.

Now, it was awake.

Tobias's golden eyes flashed with something she had never seen before.

Fear.

The pack's Alpha was afraid of her.

Riley tilted her head. "What was that you said earlier?"

Tobias struggled.

She squeezed tighter.

Then, softly almost gently she whispered:

"Welcome home."

The power surged.

Tobias let out a strangled gasp

And the world shattered around them.

A pulse of raw, burning energy exploded from Riley's core, rippling outward like a shockwave.

Tobias gasped his body arching in pain, golden eyes wide with disbelief. The walls groaned, cracks spider-webbing through the stone as the very air around them seemed to bend under her will.

Riley barely noticed.

She was somewhere else.

Somewhere deeper. Darker.

Power thrummed in her veins, ancient and endless. The hunger that had once been a whisper was now a roar, clawing at her insides, begging to be set free.

She could end this.

Right now.

One snap of her fingers, one final push, and Tobias would be gone.

Kieran's voice cut through the haze.

"Riley."

She turned.

His golden eyes weren't angry.

They weren't afraid.

They were pleading.

"Don't."

Her breath hitched.

For the first time, the hunger hesitated.

Tobias coughed, struggling in her grip.

Riley's fingers trembled.

She had him.

She had won.

But at what cost?

Her pulse pounded.

And then for the first time since waking up in those ruins

She realized.

This was her choice.

Her hand loosened.

Tobias collapsed.

And Riley took a slow, shaky breath.

Because she had just proven something.

She wasn't the monster they thought she was.

Not yet.
###chapter 31: The Hunger Beneath
Lena's words hung in the air like a blade poised to strike.

"Let's begin."

Riley's heart drummed against her ribs, but she forced herself to breathe. Steady. In control.

She had already made her decision.

There was no turning back now.

Lena's golden eyes flickered in the dim light before she turned and strode into the trees, her steps silent and effortless, as if the forest itself bent to her will.

Riley took a step forward

But a hand grabbed her wrist.

Kieran.

His grip was tight, his fingers burning against her skin. "Riley, don't do this."

She turned to him. His golden eyes were fierce, but beneath the frustration, she saw something else.

Fear.

Not for himself.

For her.

Riley's chest tightened, but she pushed it aside. "You don't understand."

Kieran's jaw clenched. "Then explain it to me."

She exhaled sharply, pulling her arm free. "I need answers, Kieran."

"She's manipulating you."

"Maybe." Riley met his gaze, steadier than she felt. "But at least she's not lying to me."

A muscle twitches in Kieran's jaw.

Riley felt something inside her twist.

Because wasn't that the truth?

Every step of the way, she had been kept in the dark.

Tobias.

Callum.

Even Kieran.

Everyone had their secrets.

And she was done waiting for someone to tell her the truth.

Riley turned away, following Lena into the dark.

Kieran didn't stop her.

And somehow, that was worse than if he had.

The forest was silent.

Too silent.

The wind didn't stir the leaves.

The branches above didn't creak.

It was as if the trees themselves were holding their breath.

Lena moved effortlessly through the shadows, her pace calm, and confident.

She didn't check to see if Riley was following.

She knew she would.

Riley forced herself forward, her boots crunching softly against the damp earth.

Behind her, Kieran trailed at a distance, his presence tense, simmering.

Lena glanced over her shoulder. "You coming, Wolfe? Or do you plan on brooding back there all night?"

Kieran's voice was sharp. "I don't trust you."

Lena smirked. "Good."

She turned back, leading them deeper into the woods.

The air grew colder, heavy with something ancient.

Riley felt it settle in her bones, crawling through her veins like wildfire.

She pressed a hand to her chest. The hunger was stirring.

Growing.

She gritted her teeth and kept walking.

The trees thinned as they reached a clearing.

And in the center

A stone altar.

Old. Cracked with age. Covered in vines and worn symbols that Riley didn't recognize but somehow, deep down, she knew them.

A strange pulse rippled through the air.

Like something here was alive.

Waiting.

Lena stopped at the edge of the clearing, tilting her head. "Feel that?"

Riley swallowed hard. "What is this place?"

Lena ran her fingers along the altar's surface, her voice quiet, reverent.

"This is where your story really begins."

Riley's pulse stumbled.

She didn't like the way Lena said that.

Like it was a fact. The truth is already written.

Kieran stepped closer, his body tense, coiled like a spring. "Enough games. What do you know?"

Lena turned to him.

She didn't speak right away.

Then, finally, she said, "You're afraid of her, aren't you?"

Riley blinked. "What?"

Kieran's breath hitched, but his expression didn't waver. "No."

Lena smirked. "Liar."

Riley's chest tightened.

Because for just a second, Kieran didn't look angry.

He looked guilty.

Lena turned back to Riley. "You're changing. You know it. You feel it."

Riley clenched her fists. "And you're saying you can help?"

Lena stepped closer.

She raised her hand slowly, and deliberately and pressed her palm against Riley's chest.

A jolt of heat burst through Riley's body, like a thousand tiny sparks igniting at once.

She gasped.

Because suddenly, she wasn't standing in the clearing anymore.

The world tilted.

She saw flashes

Fire. Blood. The ruins.

A battle beneath a red sky.

Golden eyes filled with rage.

And then

Herself.

Not as she was now.

As she had been before.

A different life.

A different her.

Standing before the same stone altar.

Riley's breath came in short, sharp bursts.

This was real.

This wasn't just a memory.

This was something buried in her very bones.

Then a voice.

Soft. Familiar.

"You were never meant to survive."

Riley's stomach lurched.

The vision snapped away.

She staggered back, gasping for breath.

The clearing came rushing back into focus.

Lena watched her carefully.

Kieran was already at her side, gripping her arm. "Riley. What the hell just happened?"

Riley's hands shook.

She looked at Lena.

And Lena looked satisfied.

"You're ready," she said softly.

Riley's chest ached.

Because she didn't know if that was true.

But something inside her had changed.

Something was awake now.

And there was no stopping it.

Riley's breath came fast, uneven, her pulse thrumming like a drumbeat in her ears. She still felt the lingering heat from Lena's touch, the aftershock of whatever had just torn through her mind.

She pressed a hand against her chest, fingers digging into the fabric of her jacket. The hunger inside her was no longer just a whisper; it was roaring, clawing beneath her skin, demanding to be acknowledged.

Kieran's grip on her arm was firm, and grounding, but his voice was sharp. "What did you do to her?"

Lena crossed her arms, completely at ease. "Nothing she wasn't already ready for."

Riley forced herself to meet Lena's gaze, her breathing still uneven. "What what was that?"

Lena studied her for a moment, then sighed. "A memory."

Riley's stomach twisted. "No. That wasn't just a memory."

Because she hadn't just seen it she had felt it.

The fire on her skin, the power surging through her blood, the weight of something too big for her body to contain.

Lena smirked. "You're right. It was more than that." She stepped forward, her golden eyes gleaming. "That was a piece of what you really are. And you're just getting started."

Riley's chest ached. She had spent weeks pushing against this feeling, resisting what everyone kept telling her. But now? There was no denying it.

Something inside her had been waiting.

And now, it was awake.

She swallowed hard, her fingers curling into fists. "Tell me what I am."

Lena's smirk deepened. "I could."

Riley's nails dug into her palms. "Then"

"But," Lena interrupted smoothly, "you won't understand until you feel it for yourself."

Riley's pulse spiked. "Feel what?"

Lena turned slightly, motioning toward the altar. "The power you've been running from." She took a slow step closer. "It's not just inside you, Riley. It's waiting for you to claim it."

Riley hesitated. Every instinct told her to step away. To ignore the way her body responded to Lena's words, the way her blood thrummed at the idea of power.

But another part of her, the part that had been stirring since the ruins, the part that had torn free when she fought Tobias wanted to know.

Needed to.

Kieran must have sensed it because his grip on her arm tightened. "Riley. Don't do this."

She turned to him, her throat dry. "I don't think I have a choice."

Kieran's golden eyes burned. "You always have a choice."

Did she?

Because every step she had taken since that night in the woods, since she saw Kieran fight for his life, since she saw Tobias's wolves tear through Silverwood

Had led her here.

Lena watched them, something almost amused in her expression. "You're wasting time."

Riley exhaled, looking back at the altar.

Everything in her ached with the need to understand.

To remember.

To know.

Before she could second-guess herself, she stepped forward.
###chapter 32: The Threshold
The second Riley stepped toward the altar, the air shifted.

It wasn't just colder it was charged, thick with something unseen, something alive. Every breath felt heavier, pressing against her ribs, curling around her like unseen fingers. The stone beneath her feet pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat buried in the earth.

She felt it.

This place knew her.

And worse it had been waiting.

Kieran moved instantly, closing the space between them, his grip firm around her wrist. "Riley." His voice was low, urgent. "You don't have to do this."

She turned to him, pulse unsteady. "Yes, I do."

Kieran's jaw tightened. "You don't understand what's happening. What this is."

He was right.

She didn't.

But some part of her, the part that had whispered to her in the ruins, the part that had stirred when Tobias looked at her with fear instead of power did.

She wrenched her wrist free, ignoring the way his fingers hesitated before letting go. She ignored the way his golden eyes burned, not with anger, but with something sharper.

Something like a loss.

Lena stood on the other side of the altar, watching. Waiting.

She didn't stop Riley.

She didn't have to.

Because Riley was already too far gone.

The symbols carved into the stone shimmered, glowing faintly in the moonlight. Some were worn with time, but others looked as if they had been etched only hours ago.

Her fingers itched to touch them.

To press her palm against the stone.

To see what it would show her.

She took another step.

The hunger in her chest thrummed, her skin tingling with the nearness of something just out of reach.

Kieran cursed behind her, muttering something under his breath.

Lena only smirked.

Riley didn't stop.

She reached out

The moment her fingers brushed the stone, the world lurched.

A sharp, pulsing heat rushed through her veins, slamming into her so forcefully that her knees buckled.

The forest vanished.

Everything vanished.

Darkness swallowed her whole.

And then

She saw.

Not glimpses.

Not shattered fragments of memories.

Everything.

Flashes of fire and smoke.

A sky split open with lightning.

Golden eyes not Kieran's, not Tobias's hers.

But different.

Brighter. Wilder. Unforgiving.

Blood in the snow.

A throne made of stone and bone.

Wolves at her feet, some kneeling, some dead.

A voice of her own, but not.

"This has to end."

And then

A scream.

Her scream.

Pain, sharp and merciless, tearing through her chest.

A hand clawing at her throat, dragging her down

And then

Silence.

The vision snapped away.

Riley hit the ground hard, gasping for air.

The clearing came back in pieces. The feel of damp earth beneath her fingers, the cool press of night air on her skin. Kieran's voice was sharp with concern, calling her name.

She barely heard him.

Her body trembled.

Not from fear.

From recognition.

She had seen that vision before.

Not in a dream.

Not in fragmented memories.

She had lived it.

She knew exactly what it was.

Her death.

Kieran's hands were on her arms, steadying her, but she barely felt them.

Lena crouched beside her, golden eyes gleaming. "You remember now, don't you?"

Riley swallowed, her throat raw. "I don't"

Lena's smirk softened into something like understanding. "You don't have to lie."

Riley closed her eyes.

The images still burned behind her eyelids.

She had been there.

She had stood on that battlefield, surrounded by the bodies of wolves who had followed her, fought for her, died for her.

And then

Someone had killed her.

Her breath hitched.

It felt so real.

Like she had just died all over again.

Kieran pulled her up gently, his grip strong but careful, like he thought she might break apart in his hands.

"What did you see?"

Riley forced herself to look at him.

And suddenly, she knew.

She knew why Kieran had looked at her that way when Tobias spoke of their past.

Why he had hesitated.

Why he had never given her all the answers.

Because he had been there.

She had died.

And Kieran had watched it happen.

Her breath came fast, uneven.

Lena studied her, quiet now. Not mocking, not amused. Just watching.

Waiting for her to put the pieces together.

Riley's voice barely worked.

"You knew."

Kieran's hands tightened around her arms.

He didn't answer.

He didn't have to.

Riley pulled away from him, stepping back. "You knew. This whole time. You" Her breath caught. "You saw it happen."

Kieran's throat bobbed as he swallowed. "Riley"

"You knew." The words tasted wrong. Bitter. Broken. "And you didn't tell me."

Kieran stepped toward her, but she flinched back, her chest aching.

It had always been there, hadn't it? That quiet space between them.

Not just history.

Not just secrets.

But guilt.

Guilt that Kieran had carried since the moment he saw her again.

Lena let out a breath, rising to her feet. "Well. That answers that."

Riley barely heard her.

Everything felt too loud.

The memory, the power burning inside her, the truth unraveling before her eyes.

She had died.

And now, she is back.

But why?

For revenge?

For something worse?

Her fingers twitched, her breath still uneven.

Lena stepped closer, her voice smooth, coaxing. "Now do you see why Tobias is afraid of you?"

Riley's pulse pounded.

Because yes.

She did.

And for the first time

She wasn't sure if he was wrong.

Riley's pulse pounded, every inch of her body burning with the weight of what she had just seen.

She had died.

She had stood at the center of something huge, something violent, something she had started and then she had fallen.

But she had come back.

And the worst part? She still didn't know why.

Kieran was still watching her, his golden eyes full of things he wasn't saying.

Things she desperately needed to hear.

She turned toward him, fists clenching at her sides. "Tell me what happened."

Kieran's throat bobbed as he swallowed, but he didn't speak.

Riley's voice rose, sharp and demanding. "Tell me how I died."

Kieran flinched.

That was all the confirmation she needed.

Lena's smirk flickered, something almost pleased in her expression. "He won't tell you," she murmured. "Because he's still trying to protect you."

Riley whipped toward her. "Protect me from what?"

Lena's golden eyes gleamed. "From yourself."

The words hit like a punch to the ribs.

Riley's breath hitched, but she refused to back down. "What does that mean?"

Lena let out a slow, careful sigh. "You think Tobias is afraid of you because of what you might do to him?" She tilted her head. "You're wrong."

Riley's hands curled tighter, nails biting into her palms.

Lena took a step closer, her voice dropping to a whisper.

"He's afraid of what you might do to everyone."

Riley froze.

The night air suddenly felt thinner, harder to breathe.

Tobias, Kieran, and even Callum had all been watching her, treating her like something dangerous.

Like something unstable.

Was this why?

Because she had already proven what she was capable of once?

Because if history repeated itself, it wouldn't just be Tobias who had something to fear.

Her stomach twisted.

That didn't make sense.

She had seen the war.

She had seen herself in the vision, fighting, leading.

She had seen the bodies, the destruction

But she hadn't seen herself turning on them.

She hadn't seen herself as the enemy.

Lena studied her for a moment, then smirked. "You think you were the hero, don't you?"

Riley's mouth opened but no words came out.

Lena chuckled softly. "Tell me, Riley. When you look at the ruins, when you feel that power inside you, does it feel like something meant to save?"

Riley's breath caught.

Because no.

No, it didn't.

It felt like fire in her veins.

Like a hunger that would never be satisfied.

Like something waiting to be unleashed.

And if she let it if she gave in 

She wasn't sure she'd ever be able to stop.

Kieran must have sensed where her mind was going, because suddenly, he was there, his hand wrapping gently but firmly around her wrist.

"You're not her," he said quietly.

His voice was steady like he needed her to believe him.

Riley's throat tightened. "Then why does it feel like I am?"

Kieran didn't answer.

Because they both knew

That might be the one question he couldn't save her from.

The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Kieran's grip on her wrist was steady, grounding, but it did nothing to stop the storm building inside her.

If she wasn't her if she wasn't the person she had seen in the vision then why did it feel like every step she took was leading her right back to that moment?

Why did the power inside her feel like something she had already wielded before?

Why did Kieran still look at her like he was waiting for the day she would prove Tobias, right?

Lena exhaled, crossing her arms. "You're asking the wrong questions."

Riley snapped her gaze to her. "Then what's the right one?"

Lena smirked. "Not who you were." She tilted her head. "But why do you come back?"

Riley's breath stalled.

Because that question

That was the one that terrified her the most.
###chapter 33: Ghosts of the Past
The world felt different after the vision.

The weight of it clung to Riley's skin, settling in her bones like an old wound. Even as the night air cooled around her, she couldn't shake the fire burning inside her, the way her blood felt charged, like a storm waiting to break.

She had died.

She had lived another life, fought another war, lost something she still couldn't name.

And yet she was here.

Alive. Awake.

And she still didn't know why.

Kieran hadn't let go of her wrist, his grip grounding, steady but there was something else in it now. Something heavy, like he was holding onto more than just her.

Like he was holding onto a truth he didn't want to say out loud.

She turned to him, swallowing hard. "Tell me."

His jaw clenched. "Riley"

"No." Her voice came out sharper than she intended, her heart pounding. "No more secrets. No more waiting for me to figure it out on my own. You knew. You saw it happen."

Kieran didn't move, but something flickered in his golden eyes, something raw, something dangerous.

"You were there," she whispered. "Weren't you?"

Silence.

And then barely above a breath

"Yes."

The word hit her like a knife to the ribs.

Her breath shook. She pulled back slightly, but Kieran's fingers curled like he couldn't let go, like if he did, she might slip away.

"You saw me die."

Kieran exhaled sharply, the sound pained, like this wasn't just a memory for him it was a wound that had never healed.

"I tried to stop it," he said finally. "I couldn't."

Riley's stomach twisted. "Who killed me?"

Kieran's throat bobbed, but he didn't answer.

She stepped closer, searching his face. "Who?"

Lena made a soft noise behind them. "That's the wrong question."

Riley tore her gaze from Kieran, spinning toward her. "Excuse me?"

Lena smirked, but something was known in her expression. "You keep asking who. As if this was simple. As if there was a villain, and a hero, and a clean ending."

Riley's pulse thrummed. "And?"

Lena tilted her head. "Ask yourself this: if you were leading a war, if you were powerful enough to have wolves kneeling at your feet, if you were feared, respected, why would you let yourself die?"

Riley blinked. The words punched through her defenses, planting something cold and uneasy in her gut.

"I didn't" she started, but she couldn't finish.

Because deep down, she already knew what Lena was implying.

She hadn't just been killed.

She had allowed it.

Her fingers curled into fists.

Kieran's voice was tight, controlled. "That's enough."

Lena ignored him. "Is it? Because she needs to understand what this means." She turned back to Riley, her golden eyes glinting. "You think you're just some girl who got caught in the middle of Tobias's war? That all of this your power, your hunger, the way the ruins called to you is just coincidence?"

Riley's pulse pounded, but she didn't speak.

Lena took a slow step forward. "You didn't just die, Riley. You chose to fall."

A cold shiver crawled down Riley's spine.

"No," she whispered. "That's not possible."

Lena smiled, slow and knowing. "Isn't it?"

Riley's breath came faster, her mind spinning.

She had been powerful. She had commanded wolves, warriors, and an entire war.

And then she had fallen.

She had stood at that altar, fire in her veins, blood on her hands.

And somehow she had lost.

It didn't make sense.

Unless

Riley pressed a hand to her forehead, her pulse thrumming. "Why?" She swallowed hard. "Why would I let that happen?"

Lena tilted her head. "That's what you have to figure out."

Kieran finally moved, stepping between them, his body tense. "That's enough for tonight."

Lena raised a brow but didn't argue.

Riley barely heard them.

Her mind was a whirlwind.

Because if Lena was right

If she had chosen this

Then what did that mean about the person she was becoming now?

She turned abruptly and walked away from the altar, the hunger gnawing at her ribs.

She needed air.

She needed to breathe.

But even as she stepped into the cool night, even as she tried to steady herself, the whispers still echoed in the back of her mind.

Not who.

Not how.

Why?

And she wasn't sure she wanted the answer.

But the answer was already inside her.

It was in the fire burning beneath her skin. In the whispers curling at the edges of her mind, beckoning her to remember. In the way, her pulse roared when she had touched the altar, when she had felt the echoes of a life she couldn't quite reach.

She pressed her hands to her temples as if that could silence the noise, the gnawing ache of knowing.

"Why?"

The question wouldn't leave her alone.

Because if she had truly chosen to die, if she had willingly let go then what had been so terrible, so inevitable, that she'd rather face death than keep fighting?

A sharp wind cut through the clearing, rustling the trees, but it did nothing to quiet the storm inside her.

Footsteps approached. Kieran.

She didn't have to look at him to know he was there. His presence was steady, and familiar, something she had trusted before everything unraveled.

He exhaled softly. "Riley."

She squeezed her eyes shut. "Don't."

"Don't what?" His voice was quiet but edged with something heavy.

"Don't act like you don't know."

A beat of silence. Then "I do know."

Her fingers twitched. She turned slowly, facing him, searching his face for something that might tell her what he wasn't saying.

His golden eyes were unreadable. "But I don't know why."

Her stomach twisted. "Then tell me what you do know."

Kieran hesitated. He never hesitated.

It sent a sharp pulse of unease through her.

He ran a hand through his dark hair, exhaling roughly. "I saw you fall, Riley. I watched you bleed out on the ground. I heard you say" He cut himself off, jaw tightening.

Riley's breath hitched. "Say what?"

Kieran's throat bobbed, but when he spoke again, it was barely a whisper.

"This has to end."

The words punched through her like a knife.

She had heard them before. In the vision. In the ruins.

"This has to end."

It had been her voice.

Her own words, spoken with certainty, with finality.

She had known she was going to die.

And she had let it happen.

Riley took an unsteady step back.

Lena had been right.

It wasn't about who had killed her. It wasn't about who had betrayed her.

It was about why she had given up.

And that terrified her more than anything.

Riley's breath came uneven, each inhales cutting through her like a blade.

She had given up.

Not in the way that meant losing a battle. Not in the way that meant being overpowered, or outmatched.

She had chosen to die.

Her voice, whispering this has to end, echoed inside her skull like a curse that refused to fade.

But why?

What had been so terrible, so inevitable, that she had let it happen?

Kieran was watching her, his golden eyes tired, but full of something else, something he hadn't said yet.

She swallowed hard, her voice breaking against the cold. "Why didn't you tell me?"

Kieran exhaled, rubbing a hand across his jaw, frustration evident in the set of his shoulders. "Because I didn't want you to remember it like this."

Anger flickered in her chest. "So you thought lying to me was better?"

"I wasn't lying." His voice was quiet, rough. "I was trying to protect you."

Riley let out a bitter laugh, shaking her head. "Protect me from what?"

Kieran hesitated.

That single moment of silence told her everything.

Her stomach twisted. "You're afraid of me."

Kieran's breath hitched. "Riley"

She took another step back, something cold and sharp twisting inside her. "You think I'm going to do it again, don't you?"

Kieran held her gaze, but he didn't answer.

He didn't have to.

She saw it in his eyes.

On the way, he had been watching her since the moment she touched the altar.

In this way he never let himself get too close.

Kieran Wolfe, the boy who had thrown himself into danger for her, who had faced down Tobias and his pack, who had stood at her side even when everything else was falling apart

Was afraid of her.

Her hands curled into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms as heat coiled beneath her skin.

Not anger.

Something worse.

Something she couldn't name.

Lena sighed behind her, breaking the silence. "Well, this is fascinating."

Riley barely turned her head, her voice tight. "Is this what you wanted? To watch me unravel?"

Lena smirked. "You're not unraveling, Riley. You're remembering. There's a difference."

Riley spun to face her fully, the weight in her chest building. "And what am I supposed to do with that?"

Lena's golden eyes gleamed. "You tell me."

Riley's breath was sharp and shallow.

She could still feel the weight of the past pressing into her skin, sinking into her ribs, filling the spaces between her breaths.

The memories weren't finished with her yet.

And neither was the power waiting to be claimed.
###chapter 34: The Breaking Point 
Riley didn't sleep that night.

She sat outside the abandoned watchtower Lena had led them to, knees pulled to her chest, arms wrapped around herself as if that would keep everything inside from unraveling. The moon hung high, a silver sliver barely breaking through the trees, casting long, twisted shadows across the clearing.

Everything felt too still.

Too quiet.

Inside, she could hear Kieran moving restlessly. She could feel him watching her through the cracks in the old stone, his presence heavy in the air. He hadn't tried to talk to her after what happened at the altar.

She wasn't sure if that made it better or worse.

The wind shifted, carrying the scent of damp earth, the lingering traces of blood still clinging to her from their earlier fight. Her body ached, her muscles screaming from exhaustion, but she couldn't rest.

Not with the words still echoing in her head.

"You think you were the hero, don't you?"

"You didn't just die, Riley. You let it happen."

She gritted her teeth, pressing her forehead against her arms.

She wanted to tell herself that Lena was wrong.

That whatever had happened in her past life had nothing to do with who she was now.

That she wasn't dangerous.

That she wasn't the reason Kieran was afraid.

But she couldn't shake it.

Because the truth was gnawing at her, tearing its way through her ribs, demanding to be acknowledged.

She hadn't just fallen.

She had let go.

And she didn't know why.

The sound of footsteps behind her made her shoulders tense.

She didn't turn. "If you're here to lecture me, don't."

Lena let out a soft chuckle. "Not in the mood for lectures? That's a shame. I give excellent ones."

Riley sighed, rubbing her temples. "What do you want?"

Lena stepped beside her, lowering herself onto a nearby rock. "You seemed like you had a lot on your mind."

"No kidding."

Lena smirked. "So talk."

Riley shot her a glare. "Since when do you care?"

Lena leaned back slightly, stretching her legs out in front of her. "I don't. But I do find you interesting." She flicked a stray leaf off her knee. "Not a lot of people get to see their death and walk away from it."

Riley's stomach twisted. "It wasn't just a vision."

Lena hummed in agreement. "No. It was a memory."

Riley closed her eyes. "Then why don't I remember all of it?"

"That's the real question, isn't it?" Lena tilted her head. "You don't forget something like that unless you make yourself forget."

Riley stiffened.

Lena continued. "So the real question isn't what happened to you? Why did you want to forget it?"

Riley exhaled sharply, looking down at her hands.

That was what scared her the most.

If she had chosen to die if she had let herself fall then what else had she been willing to do?

Had she hurt people? Had she started something she couldn't finish?

Had she deserved it?

The thought made her stomach churn.

Lena watched her, something thoughtful in her golden gaze. "You ever notice how power works in this world, Riley?"

Riley frowned. "What?"

Lena's lips curled. "The strongest ones never get to keep it." She gestured vaguely. "They either destroy themselves or get destroyed."

Riley swallowed hard.

Was that what had happened to her?

Had she been so strong that the world had to erase her?

Had she become something so monstrous that dying was the only way to stop her?

The thought sent a cold chill through her.

Lena sighed. "You're overthinking it."

Riley let out a dry laugh. "Oh, I'm sorry. It's just hard to be rational when I just saw my death and found out my best friend has been lying to me."

Lena arched her brow. "Is that the worst part?"

Riley's breath hitched.

No.

The worst part was the way Kieran had looked at her.

Like he had been waiting for this moment.

Like he had known all along that she would reach this breaking point, and all he could do was watch it happen.

Her chest ached.

Lena stretched lazily, cracking her knuckles. "If it makes you feel better, you don't strike me as someone who went down easily."

Riley huffed. "That doesn't help."

Lena smirked. "No? It should." She turned her gaze toward the trees, her expression unreadable. "Because it means whatever happened to you, whatever made you let go must have been something powerful enough to break you."

Riley shivered.

She didn't want to think about that.

She wasn't sure she could survive breaking twice.

Lena stood, brushing dirt from her pants. "Come inside when you're ready. We have a lot to prepare for."

Riley frowned. "Prepare for what?"

Lena's smirk returned, sharp and knowing. "The pack is splitting."

Riley's heart stumbled.

"What?"

Lena tilted her head. "Tobias is losing control. Wolves are turning against him. Some of them are running. And some of them?" She smiled, slow and dangerous. "They're looking for someone else to follow."

Riley's stomach twisted.

She knew what Lena was implying.

What she was offering.

Riley exhaled slowly. "And you think that's me?"

Lena grinned. "Oh, I know it's you."

Riley's hands curled into fists.

More wolves. More responsibility.

More people are looking at her, waiting for her to make a choice.

A choice she wasn't even sure she should have.

Lena winked. "Think about it."

And then, just like that, she disappeared into the darkness, leaving Riley alone with her thoughts.

With her fears.

With the weight of something looming over her like a second death.

Because if Tobias's pack was fracturing if his wolves were desperate for someone to lead them

Then history wasn't just repeating itself.

It was giving her another chance.

And Riley wasn't sure if that was a gift or a warning.

A warning.

That's what it felt like.

The wind stirred around her, rustling the dead leaves at her feet, whispering through the trees like a voice she couldn't quite hear. The weight in her chest didn't fade. If anything, it grew, pressing against her ribs like something clawing to get out.

She had seen this before.

Not in a vision.

Not in her dreams.

But in the ruins. In the memories locked deep in her bones, in the blood-soaked echoes of a past, she had tried to forget.

She had stood at the center of a war before.

She had led wolves before.

And somehow, she had lost it all.

Now the same thing was happening.

Tobias's pack was fracturing.

The balance of power was shifting.

And just like before, they were looking for someone to follow.

Someone to either save them or destroy them.

Her stomach churned.

Lena's voice still echoed in her head, smooth and knowing. I know it's you.

She didn't want it to be.

She didn't want to be anyone's leader.

She didn't want to be anyone's second chance at war.

And yet

Riley sucked in a slow, sharp breath, forcing herself to her feet.

Because whether she wanted it or not, whether she was ready or not

The past wasn't done with her.

And this time?

She wasn't sure if she'd survive it.

Or worse

She wasn't sure if she wanted to.

That was the truth gnawing at the edges of her thoughts, the one she refused to say out loud. Because deep down, in the part of her, she had spent years ignoring, she knew something had brought her back.

Not fate.

No luck.

Something else.

Something unfinished.

The trees around her whispered, the night stretching wide and endless, and for a moment, she let herself wonder

What if she didn't fight it?

What if she stopped resisting, stopped running, stopped trying to prove she wasn't the same person who had fallen all those years ago?

What if she was?

Her breath came slow and unsteady, fingers twitching at her sides.

The hunger inside her didn't feel like an enemy anymore.

It felt like a promise.

A reminder that no matter how much she tried to deny it, no matter how many times Kieran looked at her like she was still the girl he had met in Silverwood

She was more.

And maybe, just maybe

She had always been.

Not a victim.

Not a girl caught in the middle of someone else's war.

Not even a lost soul trying to piece together a life that had been taken from her.

She was something older, something deeper than just a girl who had been brought back.

Because what if she hadn't just been given a second chance?

What if she had taken it?

What if, in her final moments before the blood, before the fall, before the world had closed in around her she had made a choice?

Not to die.

But to return.

The thought clawed through her, sharp and unrelenting.

Because that would mean none of this was an accident.

Not Tobias hunting her.

Not the hunger inside her.

Not even Kieran's fear.

She had come back for a reason.

And maybe it wasn't just to survive.

Maybe it was to finish what she started.

The realization sent a shiver through her, cold and sharp like ice cracking beneath her feet.

Because if that was true if she had truly chosen to return then that meant she had known what was waiting for her.

She had known about the war.

She had known about Tobias.

She had known that Kieran, Callum, and Lena had all been here before.

And yet, she had still come back.

Her hands curled into fists.

Had she been so desperate? So determined?

Or had she simply been willing to do whatever it took to win this time?

The idea settled deep in her chest, wrapping around her ribs, squeezing.

She wasn't sure if it terrified her or thrilled her.

The night around her seemed darker now, heavier with unspoken truths. The trees loomed tall, their branches reaching toward the sky like they knew what she had just realized.

She had spent weeks searching for answers, but maybe the real question wasn't why did I come back?

Maybe the real question was

What am I supposed to do now that I have?
###chapter 35: The Awakening 
The air was thick with expectation as if the forest itself was waiting for Riley to make her next move. The weight of her realization hadn't settled yet, hadn't fully sunk in but it would.

It had to.

Because whether she liked it or not, whether she feared it or embraced it, she had been here before.

And she had come back for a reason.

Her fingers twitched at her sides, a restless energy humming beneath her skin. It was stronger now, harder to ignore, as if something inside her had been stirred awake and it refused to sleep again.

A branch snapped behind her.

Riley didn't flinch.

She already knew who it was.

"You should be inside," Kieran said, his voice steady but cautious. "Lena's not someone you want to trust blindly."

Riley let out a quiet breath, watching the mist curl around her feet. "I don't trust her."

Kieran stepped closer, and she felt the warmth of him at her back. "Then what are you doing out here?"

Riley turned slightly, meeting his gaze. His golden eyes flickered with something unreadable, something tense.

"I don't know," she admitted.

It wasn't a lie.

Because she didn't know what she was waiting for, only that the air felt charged, that the night was pressing against her like it was expecting something to happen.

Kieran studied her, his jaw tight. "You've been different since the altar."

Her breath hitched, but she didn't look away. "I saw my death, Kieran. I think I'm allowed to be a little different."

Something flashed in his expression of guilt.

Riley swallowed hard. "Why didn't you tell me?"

Kieran exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "Because I knew what it would do to you."

She clenched her fists. "And what's that?"

His gaze burned into hers, heavy and knowing.

"Make you question who you are."

The words struck deep.

Because he was right.

She had spent her entire life knowing exactly who she was: a girl with a missing father, a mother who worked too much, a life that had always felt just a little too small for her.

Now?

Now, she wasn't sure if she had ever really been that girl at all.

Riley turned away, staring back into the forest. "It doesn't matter."

Kieran tensed. "It matters."

"No," she said, voice softer now. "Because no matter who I was, I'm still here. And I don't plan on letting it happen again."

She felt his gaze on her, felt the unspoken words between them.

Finally, he sighed. "Then what happens now?"

Riley didn't answer.

Because she didn't know.

She just knew that something was coming.

Something big.

And she had the sinking feeling that when it did, she wouldn't be able to stop it.

They stayed like that for a long moment, neither speaking, just standing there in the cold.

Then

The ground shifted beneath her feet.

A pulse of energy shot through the air, so sudden and sharp that Riley gasped.

Kieran cursed, stepping toward her as the wind around them picked up, howling through the trees. The earth trembled beneath them, the very air crackling with unseen force.

"What the hell" Kieran started, but then he stopped.

Because Riley wasn't just feeling it.

She was causing it.

The realization hit her like a punch to the ribs.

The energy, the pull, the strange weight pressing into her chest wasn't coming from the forest.

It was coming from her.

She took a shaky step back, her breath coming faster now. "Kieran"

But before she could say another word, the force inside her burst outward.

It was like being struck by lightning from the inside out.

Heat tore through her veins, her vision blurred, and suddenly she was somewhere else.

Not in the forest.

Not in the ruins.

Somewhere darker.

Somewhere ancient.

The air was heavy with the scent of fire and blood. The sky above was a deep, endless red, cracked with veins of gold. The world was silent. Still.

Until it wasn't.

A figure stood before her.

Tall. Commanding. Eyes like molten gold, burning with something too vast, too dangerous to be human.

Riley's pulse spiked.

Because it wasn't just any figure.

It was her.

But not her.

Not as she was now.

The woman in front of her was stronger. Wilder. There was something terrifyingly familiar about the way she stood, about the way she looked at Riley like she was nothing more than a shadow of what she had once been.

The hunger inside Riley roared.

The woman tilted her head, her lips curving into something close to a smile.

"Ah," she murmured. "You finally remember."

Riley's breath hitched. "What is this?"

The woman stepped closer, and the ground beneath them trembled.

"You already know."

Riley shook her head. "No. This isn't real."

The woman's expression didn't change.

"It's more real than anything you've ever known."

The words curled around Riley's ribs, sinking into her like hooks.

Because she did know.

She knew that this wasn't just a hallucination.

Wasn't just another vision.

This was a part of her.

A part that had been locked away, buried deep until now.

The woman took another step closer.

"You are not broken, Riley. You were never meant to be."

Riley's breath came faster. "Then why did I"

"Fall?" The woman's golden eyes gleamed. "Because you chose to."

The words rang through her skull, sending cold dread crashing through her.

"No," Riley whispered. "That's not"

"You let yourself be erased."

The ground shook, the sky above them cracking open.

"But it didn't work, did it?"

The woman's smirk deepened, and suddenly Riley knew what was happening.

This wasn't just a vision.

This was her awakening.

Her old self, the one who had died, who had been erased, was coming back.

And there was no stopping it.

"It's time, Riley." The woman's voice was soft, coaxing. "Let go."

Riley's pulse roared.

The hunger inside her, the fire, the power it wanted out.

But if she let it

Would she still be herself?

Or would she become something else?

Something unstoppable?

The woman raised her hand.

"Let me show you."

And Riley for the first time didn't pull away.

Heat exploded through Riley's body.

It wasn't like before, not like the strange flickers of power she had felt over the past few weeks, not like the slow awakening of something old stirring inside her.

This was fire ripping through her veins.

It was everything at once.

She couldn't breathe, couldn't think her entire body felt like it was breaking apart and reforming at the same time like she was being torn into pieces and put back together into something new.

Or maybe not new.

Maybe something ancient.

Something that had been waiting for her to wake up.

The woman her other self watched her with sharp golden eyes, not moving, not speaking.

Because she didn't have to.

She had already won.

Riley gasped, stumbling back, her chest heaving. The moment she moved, she realized

She wasn't in her body anymore.

Not really.

She was in the space between, in the moment before everything changed.

The woman stepped closer.

"Let it happen."

Riley clenched her teeth, her hands shaking. "I don't want to be you."

A flicker of amusement passed across the woman's face.

"Oh, Riley." Her voice was quiet, smooth as smoke. "You already are."

The words hit like a punch, knocking the air from Riley's lungs.

No.

No, that wasn't true.

She had fought against this against hunger, against the pull, against the whispers telling her she was more than what she believed.

She had fought to be herself.

Hadn't she?

Her mind reeled, the fire inside her roaring higher, demanding to be unleashed.

The woman herself, the ghost of whom she had been tilted her head, studying her.

"You think you can fight this forever?" She took another step forward, her presence swallowing everything around them.

"You think Kieran can save you?"

Riley flinched.

Because deep down, wasn't that the truth?

Wasn't that why she had followed Kieran blindly, why she had clung to the hope that he was holding onto something she couldn't remember?

Because some part of her had been waiting for him to pull her back from the edge of whatever she was becoming?

The woman's golden eyes gleamed.

"He can't."

Riley's breath shook.

"No one can."

Her past self raised a hand, palm outstretched, and suddenly

The world shattered.

The red sky cracked, the ground crumbled beneath her feet, and Riley was falling

Falling through time, through memory, through power.

She hit the ground hard.

But it wasn't stone beneath her.

It was Earth.

Cool, damp, real.

She gasped, her lungs heaving, her hands digging into the dirt beneath her. Her body ached like she had been struck by lightning and barely survived.

Then

A voice.

Not the woman's.

Not her own.

Kieran.

"Riley!"

She opened her eyes just as his hands closed around her shoulders, his grip desperate, unsteady.

The world rushed back into focus.

The trees. The night air. The watchtower behind them.

She was back.

But something was wrong.

The look on Kieran's face told her that much.

His golden eyes were wide, wild with something she couldn't place.

Fear.

Not for himself.

For her.

She tried to speak, but her throat felt raw, her lungs burning.

Kieran's hands trembled against her. "What the hell just happened?"

Riley shook her head, trying to ground herself, trying to stop the buzzing under her skin, the power still crackling through her veins.

She wasn't the same.

She felt it.

Kieran saw it.

She could see the way his gaze flickered across her face, searching, waiting for her to say something that would prove she was still the same Riley.

But was she?

She swallowed hard. "I I saw her."

Kieran's fingers tightened. "Who?"

Riley's breath hitched.

Because she knew now.

She knew exactly who the woman in her vision had been.

Not a ghost.

Not a hallucination.

Not some piece of her past trying to break free.

She had seen herself.

The real her.

The one who had built something so powerful that the world itself had tried to erase her.

And failed.

Her voice came out hoarse, almost broken.

"I think I just remembered who I am."

Kieran's breath caught. "Riley"

Before he could say anything else, the wind shifted.

The scent of wolves.

Too many of them.

They weren't alone.

Kieran cursed under his breath, helping Riley to her feet, his body instantly tense, defensive.

But Riley wasn't afraid.

Not anymore.

Because whatever had been holding her back, whatever part of her had been fighting the truth

It was gone.

And she had a feeling that whatever came next, nothing could stop her now.

Not Tobias.

Not the pack that was hunting her.

Not even the version of herself she had tried so desperately to bury.

The hunger inside her, the power that had been clawing at the edges of her mind, was no longer something she feared. It wasn't something she needed to control, it was something she needed to embrace.

The scent of wolves grew stronger, the tension in the air shifting like a storm about to break.

Kieran moved beside her, his body tense, ready to fight. "Riley"

She glanced at him, and for the first time, she didn't hesitate.

She wasn't running.

She wasn't afraid.

She turned toward the darkness beyond the trees, where the wolves were waiting.

And she smiled.
###chapter 36: The Wolf at the Gate
The scent of wolves pressed in from all sides.

Riley could smell the damp earth, the sweat, the tension in the air before she saw them. Dozens of them. Moving through the trees like shadows, circling, waiting.

Kieran's body tensed beside her, his golden eyes flashing as he tracked their movements. His muscles were coiled tight, ready for a fight.

But Riley didn't flinch.

She stood still, the cold air pressing against her skin, the weight of what had just happened still buzzing through her bones.

She wasn't afraid.

Not anymore.

A low growl rumbled through the trees.

Then, from the darkness, a figure stepped forward.

Tall. Broad shoulders. A scar ran from his temple down to his jaw, cutting through what had once been a striking face. His golden eyes were sharp, assessing, and completely focused on her.

Not Kieran.

Not the others.

Only her.

Riley recognized him immediately.

Marcus Hale.

One of Tobias's enforcers.

And the fact that he was here meant one thing.

Tobias had sent them for her.

Marcus stopped a few feet away, head tilting slightly. He sniffed the air once, his nose wrinkling, his brows furrowing slightly as if he wasn't expecting what he found.

Riley didn't move.

She held his gaze, waiting.

Then he spoke, his voice low, rough.

"You smell different."

Kieran let out a low growl, stepping forward slightly, but Riley lifted a hand. Wait.

Marcus's sharp gaze flicked between them before settling back on her. "What did you do?"

Riley took a slow breath. "What do you think?"

Marcus's lips curled slightly, something uneasy flashing in his expression. "I think Tobias was right to be worried."

Kieran stepped in front of her now, his stance completely rigid. "You need to leave."

Marcus ignored him. "That's not how this works, Wolfe." His gaze returned to Riley. "Tobias wants you back."

Riley smiled, slow and sharp. "That's too bad."

Marcus didn't smile back.

"You don't get it, do you?" He exhaled through his nose, looking almost frustrated. "This isn't a request. You come with us, or we make you."

The wolves behind him shifted slightly, their bodies flickering in and out of the trees, the tension thick enough to choke on.

Kieran's claws were already out. "I'd like to see you try."

Marcus finally looked at him, his lips twisting. "Oh, I bet you would." His voice dropped. "That didn't work out too well for you last time, though, did it?"

Kieran snarled, the air around him crackling.

But Riley stepped forward first.

All the heat in her veins, all the power thrumming beneath her skin wanted out.

She didn't know what had changed.

She didn't know if it was the vision, the truth, the past coming back in pieces.

But she wasn't just standing here anymore.

She wasn't just reacting.

She was something else now.

And Marcus knew it.

She could see it in the way his stance shifted, in the way the wolves around him hesitated, their ears twitching, their nostrils flaring.

They could feel it, too.

Something was different.

Riley tilted her head. "You don't want to do this."

Marcus held her gaze. "I think I do."

A flicker of amusement curled in her chest. "Do you?"

His nostrils flared again.

And then his breath hitched.

His brows furrowed, his fingers flexing like he had just touched something that burned.

And that was when Riley understood.

It wasn't just that something had changed inside her.

It was that they could sense it.

The same way they could sense the Alpha. The same way they could sense power.

The realization sent a jolt through her.

The wolves weren't just waiting for Marcus's orders.

They were waiting for hers.

A slow, careful breath left her lips.

She stepped forward again, ignoring Kieran's sharp warning behind her.

Marcus didn't move.

Neither did the wolves.

And that was the confirmation she needed.

They weren't sure if she was their enemy.

Because deep down, some part of them still recognized her.

And that meant she had a choice.

She could fight them.

Or she could take them.

The thought sent another pulse of heat through her veins, her stomach twisting in something that wasn't quite fear.

She shouldn't be considering this.

She shouldn't be thinking about what it would mean to turn them against Tobias, to take what had once been his and make it hers.

But the hunger inside her?

It wanted her to.

The power that had been clawing at the edges of her mind, the thing she had tried so desperately to suppress was awake now.

And it wasn't going back to sleep.

Riley inhaled slowly, letting her golden gaze flick between the wolves in front of her.

She could see them watching, waiting, sensing the shift in the air.

A test.

A challenge.

Marcus felt it too.

His hands curled into fists, his jaw tightening. "What did you do?"

Riley smiled. "I woke up."

The words were barely out of her mouth before everything exploded.

The wolves lunged.

Kieran moved first, claws flashing, his body a blur as he intercepted the first attacker. The impact sent a shockwave through the clearing, the air crackling with heat and violence.

Marcus was on her in seconds, fast and brutal.

But Riley was faster.

She sidestepped his attack with ease, twisting at the last second, her body reacting before her mind could catch up. It was instinct. Pure and effortless.

Marcus's eyes widened.

She saw the exact moment he realized she wasn't the same girl he had been sent to retrieve.

The moment he realized he wasn't in control anymore.

Riley didn't wait.

She lunged, faster than she should have been, stronger than she had ever been. She slammed her palm into Marcus's chest, and the second her skin made contact

He collapsed.

A violent pulse of heat shot through her fingers, something raw and uncontained tearing through the space between them.

Marcus choked, eyes wild as he hit the ground, his body spasming like something had just ripped through him.

The wolves stopped.

The fight was over before it had even started.

They could feel it.

They could feel her.

Something deeper than a challenge, something more powerful than a simple battle for dominance.

Recognition.

The realization settled deep in Riley's bones, something ancient and undeniable.

She had won.

Not through blood.

Not through death.

Through something else.

Through who she was.

The silence stretched.

Marcus lay at her feet, breathing hard, but he didn't move.

The wolves watched her now, their ears flat, their heads lowered not in fear.

In submission.

A new thought curled inside her.

Maybe she had come back to finish what she started.

But maybe just maybe

She had come back to take back everything.

The weight of it settled over her like a second skin.

The wolves had lowered their heads, their bodies tense not out of fear, but out of recognition.

They saw something in her.

Something they knew.

Something they had once followed.

And for the first time, Riley wasn't sure if that terrified her or thrilled her.

Her breath came slow and steady, the fire inside her simmering beneath the surface, no longer raging out of control but not disappearing, either. It was there. Waiting. Watching. Ready.

She stared down at Marcus, who was still struggling to move, his chest heaving. His golden eyes flickered with pain, but beneath it beneath the exhaustion, the frustration

There was something else.

Something close to understanding.

"You" he rasped, coughing, his fingers curling into the dirt beneath him. "I should have known."

Riley tilted her head slightly, her heart still pounding. "Known what?"

Marcus lifted his gaze to hers, his breath uneven.

"That you weren't meant to be hunted," he whispered.

She inhaled sharply, the words striking something deep inside her, something raw and undeniable.

Marcus swallowed hard, looking past her at the wolves still frozen in place, at the ones who had hesitated, the ones who hadn't followed his orders.

And then, softly, "They're waiting for you."

The realization sank in, cold and heavy.

Waiting for her to do what?

To fight? To run? To prove to them that she was nothing more than the girl they had been sent to capture?

Or

Were they waiting for something else?

Something bigger?

Something that had been promised to them long before she even knew she existed?

A slow, cold shiver ran down her spine.

She could feel Kieran's gaze on her, burning, waiting for her to say something, to make a choice.

But she didn't know what to say.

Because Marcus was right.

They weren't looking at her like she was an enemy.

They were looking at her like she was already theirs.

The thought sent a sharp, electric thrill coiling through her chest.

She took a step forward, slowly, carefully. The wolves tensed but didn't move away.

She could feel the shift between them, something more than instinct, something deeper than a simple show of dominance.

This wasn't just about winning a fight.

It was about who she was.

Who she had always been.

She inhaled slowly, tasting the change in the air.

This wasn't just about Tobias anymore.

This wasn't about Kieran, Lena, or even the war waiting just beyond the horizon.

This was about her.

And if they were waiting

Then maybe it was time to stop running.

Maybe it was time to step forward.

To see if they would follow.

Her heart pounded.

The wolves watched.

And Riley took the first step toward them.

The moment Riley stepped forward, the wolves stilled.

Not in fear.

Not in defiance.

But in expectation.

She could feel it now, the way their gazes followed her, the way their bodies tensed but did not retreat. The air between them was thick, humming with an energy she didn't fully understand, but recognized all the same.

This wasn't just about power.

It wasn't just about dominance.

It was about belonging.

Riley's pulse roared in her ears, but she didn't let herself hesitate.

She took another step.

One of the wolves, a broad-shouldered male with dark fur and golden eyes, lowered his head slightly. Not a full bow, but close.

Her breath hitched.

She knew what this was.

Not submission.

Not surrender.

The others shifted, their movements cautious, almost careful as if waiting to see what she would do next.

Kieran was beside her now, his presence tense, his breath uneven. She didn't have to look at him to know what he was thinking.

This wasn't supposed to be happening.

She wasn't supposed to have this effect on them.

But she did.

And Tobias had known it all along.

That's why he had hunted her.

Not just because she was a threat.

But because she was something more.

Marcus exhaled sharply from where he still knelt on the ground, shaking his head slightly. "I don't know what you are anymore."

Riley finally turned back to him. "I don't think I do either."

Marcus let out a rough, humorless laugh, rubbing a hand across his face. "Then we're all in trouble."

She narrowed her gaze. "Why?"

His golden eyes flicked back up to hers, something unreadable in his expression.

"Because if you wanted them," he murmured, nodding toward the wolves still watching her, still waiting

"They're already yours."

A sharp pulse of heat shot through her chest.

The weight of his words settled deep.

Because they weren't just a possibility.

They were the truth.

And she had a choice to make.

One that could change everything.

Her breath came slow, measured, but inside she was burning.

Because for the first time since all of this had started, she wasn't being hunted.

She wasn't being cornered, or forced, or chased.

She was being given something.

Something dangerous.

Something powerful.

And the worst part?

Somewhere deep inside

She wanted it.
###chapter 37: A Throne of Ash and Bone 
Riley had spent her entire life feeling like an outsider.

She had never truly belonged not in Silverwood, not at school, not even in her own home. There had always been something off about her, something lurking beneath the surface that made her feel like she was standing on the edge of a world she couldn't quite touch.

Now, as she stood before the wolves that should have been her enemies, wolves that should have torn her apart on sight she realized why.

She had never belonged because she had never been meant to.

Not in that life.

Not in that version of herself.

But here?

Here, with the wind pressing cold against her skin, with the fire in her veins roaring louder than it ever had before this felt right.

The wolves were waiting.

She could feel it in the air, in the way their bodies remained still yet alert, their eyes tracking her every movement.

They weren't challenging her.

They weren't even questioning her.

They were watching.

Listening.

Waiting.

She clenched her hands into fists, her nails digging into her palms as a strange, sharp ache twisted through her chest.

She had a choice to make.

Take them. Or turn them away.

Kieran stepped closer, his presence solid beside her, his voice low, tense. "Riley we need to leave."

She could hear the warning in his voice.

Not because of the wolves.

Not even because of Marcus, still kneeling on the ground, breathing unsteady as he tried to recover from whatever had happened when she touched him.

No, Kieran was warning her about herself.

Because he knew.

He felt it just as much as she did.

This moment, this choice would change everything.

But Riley wasn't sure she could walk away.

Something in her was thrumming, alive, demanding.

This wasn't power in the way she had once imagined it. It wasn't just something she could control or contain.

It was something that called to others.

Something that made them recognize her.

Something that whispered of a past she had yet to fully understand.

Riley turned to Marcus, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "Why are they listening to me?"

Marcus exhaled slowly, wiping the sweat from his forehead as he finally pushed himself to his feet. His golden eyes flickered with something almost reluctant.

"You don't know?"

She held his gaze. "If I knew, I wouldn't be asking."

Marcus let out a rough chuckle, shaking his head. "Then you're more dangerous than I thought."

Kieran stiffened beside her. "That's not an answer."

Marcus glanced at him but didn't argue. Instead, his eyes landed on Riley again, assessing her.

"You don't smell like Tobias," he murmured. "You don't smell like the Forsaken, either." He tilted his head slightly, studying her with something close to curiosity. "You smell like something older."

A slow, cold shiver crawled up Riley's spine.

"Older?" she echoed.

Marcus nodded. "Like something that was buried a long time ago."

She swallowed hard.

Because she had felt that.

Every time she touched the ruins, every time she saw the visions of her past, every time she let her power rise instead of fighting it down

She felt ancient.

Like she had existed before this war, before Tobias, before any of them.

And the wolves knew it.

That was why they hesitated.

That was why Marcus was looking at her like he wasn't sure if she was an enemy or something worse.

Kieran's voice was tight when he spoke. "That doesn't explain why they're waiting for her."

Marcus didn't blink. "Because they're packed."

Riley frowned. "Tobias's pack."

Marcus shook his head. "No."

A pause.

Then, softly"Yours."

The words slammed into Riley like a physical blow.

She took a step back. "No."

Marcus's lips curled slightly, but it wasn't amusing. It was understanding.

"Yes."

Kieran growled, stepping between them. "That's not possible."

Marcus's gaze flicked toward him. "And yet, here we are."

The wolves behind him didn't move, didn't even blink.

But Riley could feel it now, the way the air had shifted.

She wasn't imagining it.

They weren't just waiting for an Alpha's command.

They were waiting for hers.

Her breath came too fast, her heartbeat hammering louder than ever.

No.

She wasn't supposed to have a pack.

She wasn't supposed to be leading anyone.

She had barely figured out who she even was.

But the moment she had stepped forward, the moment she had met their eyes and they had hesitated instead of attacking

She had felt it.

A connection.

A pull.

Something old and undeniable.

Something that had always been there.

Panic curled inside her chest, but beneath it something worse.

Something close to wanting.

Because what if she didn't turn them away?

What if she took them?

What if, instead of running, instead of waiting for Tobias to strike again, instead of pretending she wasn't part of this war she stepped into it fully?

What if she did what Tobias had feared all along?

What if she took his pack from him and made them hers?

The thought sent a sharp, dangerous thrill rushing through her.

Kieran must have seen it, must have felt it because he reached for her arm, his fingers firm, grounding.

"Riley," he said softly, and she heard the plea in his voice.

She turned toward him, and for the first time since meeting him, she saw worry.

Not just for her.

For what she might become.

And that was the problem, wasn't it?

He still saw her as Riley Hayes.

But what if she wasn't?

What if she had never been?

The wolves were still watching, still waiting, their bodies poised, expectant.

Marcus had fallen silent.

Even Lena, who had emerged from the watchtower to witness the exchange, stood back, her expression unreadable but interested.

Because everyone here knew it.

Felt it.

This wasn't just a battle for survival anymore.

It was a battle for leadership.

For power.

For the next move in a war that had been waiting for her to make a choice.

Riley inhaled, her fingers twitching at her sides.

And then she spoke.

"Go back to Tobias," she told Marcus, her voice steady, strong.

He frowned. "What?"

She lifted her chin. "Tell him I'm not running anymore."

Marcus's gaze sharpened. "That's a mistake."

Riley smiled.

"No." Her voice was quiet, but certain. "It's a warning."

Marcus hesitated for a long moment as if weighing whether he should listen or strike now.

But then, finally, he nodded once.

A slow, almost respectful bow of his head.

And wolves her wolves turned and disappeared into the trees.

Kieran let out a slow breath beside her, but she could feel the tension still thrumming in him, still coiled beneath the surface.

He wasn't relieved.

Because she had just made the first move.

And there was no turning back now.

There was no turning back now.

Riley had drawn a line in the sand.

She had sent a message not just to Tobias, but to everyone. To the wolves who had once hunted her, to the pack that had once been his, to the ones who had been waiting, watching, wondering if she was the same girl she had been before.

She wasn't.

And they all knew it now.

Kieran hadn't moved, but she could feel the tension in him like a live wire, sharp and dangerous. His golden eyes flickered in the dim light, his breath slow and measured, as if he was trying to hold something back.

Finally, he spoke, his voice low. "Do you know what you just did?"

Riley turned to him, her heartbeat steady, calm. "Yeah."

Something flashed across his face, frustration, anger, something else beneath it that she couldn't name.

"You just declared war."

Riley tilted her head slightly, considering. "I think the war is already coming."

Kieran exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "That's not the point."

She took a slow step closer, searching his face. "Then what is?"

His jaw tightened. "You didn't just challenge Tobias. You put yourself at the center of this."

"I was always at the center of this."

His fingers curled into fists at his sides. "Not like this, Riley."

She lifted a brow. "Then tell me how exactly I was supposed to stay out of it?"

Kieran didn't answer immediately. He just looked at her, something raw and torn flickering beneath the frustration in his eyes.

Like he had hoped for something else.

Like he had hoped she would choose differently.

She wasn't sure why that stung.

She wasn't sure why part of her still wanted him to see her as someone who could be saved.

But she wasn't helpless.

She wasn't a girl in need of protection.

She had never been.

Riley inhaled, her voice softer now. "I'm not afraid of him."

Kieran's jaw clenched. "You should be."

Something cold curled in her stomach.

Not because he was wrong.

But because the look in his eyes told her he wasn't just talking about Tobias anymore.

He was talking about her.

The weight of what had just happened, the wolves submitting, Marcus's warning, the shift in the air, it wasn't just war.

It was claiming.

She had stepped forward, and they had followed.

Because they recognized her.

Because some part of them had already belonged to her before.

Because, maybe, deep down, she had already belonged to them, too.

Kieran swallowed hard, taking a slow step back. "You don't understand what this means."

Riley's lips parted, but before she could respond, another voice cut through the night.

"Oh, I think she does."

Lena.

Riley turned to see her leaning casually against a tree, arms crossed, watching them like a spectator at a show.

She pushed off the trunk, stepping closer, her golden eyes gleaming. "That was quite the move you just made, princess."

Riley narrowed her gaze. "What do you want, Lena?"

Lena smirked. "To see what you do next."

Riley exhaled, her pulse still thrumming beneath her skin.

Because that was the real question now, wasn't it?

What happened next?

Tobias would hear about this.

He would come.

And when he did, Riley wouldn't just be the girl who had escaped.

She would be the girl who took what was his.

And she had no intention of giving it back.

And she had no intention of giving it back.

Not now.

Not ever.

The fire in her veins burned hotter, curling around her ribs like it had always been there, waiting for her to claim it. Tobias had hunted her, had tried to erase her, had sent his wolves to drag her back into the dark

But he had failed.

And now?

Now she wasn't just surviving.

She was talking.

Kieran was still watching her, his golden eyes dark with something unreadable, but she didn't look away. She didn't shrink under his gaze, didn't try to soften what had just happened.

Because there was no undoing it.

Lena chuckled, tilting her head slightly as she studied Riley. "I hope you're ready for this, sweetheart."

Riley let a slow smile curl at the edges of her lips.

"I was born ready."
###chapter 38: The Crown of a Ghost 
Riley barely slept that night.

Not because she was afraid because she wasn't.

Not anymore.

The air outside the watchtower was thick with expectation, the weight of her choice settling deep in her bones. The wind whispered through the trees, carrying the scent of damp earth and something sharper like the ghosts of everything she had lost and everything she was about to take.

She sat against the stone wall, knees drawn up, arms wrapped around herself, staring out at the darkness. Waiting.

Because Tobias would come.

He would hear about what happened, about how his wolves had hesitated, about how they had looked at her as if she was something to be followed, not feared.

She had taken her first step toward something dangerous.

And she didn't regret it.

A movement at the edge of the trees caught her attention.

A shadow shifts between the branches.

She didn't move, didn't let her heartbeat change its rhythm, didn't let her body betray her awareness.

If someone was watching, she would let them.

Because she was done hiding.

Another shift this time closer.

Then, a whisper of movement behind her.

She turned her head slightly, just enough to catch the glint of golden eyes in the moonlight.

Kieran.

He was leaning against the wall a few feet away, arms crossed, his expression unreadable.

"You should be inside," he murmured.

"So should you."

Kieran exhaled through his nose, but he didn't argue.

They sat in silence for a long moment, the space between them charged with everything that had been left unsaid.

Finally, Riley spoke. "You're still angry."

Kieran didn't move. "I'm not angry."

She arched a brow.

He sighed, rubbing a hand across his jaw. "I just don't know if you understand what you did tonight."

Riley tilted her head. "I sent a message."

Kieran's golden eyes flickered with something sharp. "You declared war."

She held his gaze, steady, unyielding. "It was already coming."

Kieran let out a quiet breath, his hands curling into fists at his sides. "You think Tobias is going to let this slide? That he'll just take this as a challenge and leave it at that?"

Riley stayed silent.

Because she knew Tobias.

She knew exactly what he would do.

He would come for her.

But that was the point.

Kieran's jaw clenched. "This isn't just about Tobias anymore. You felt it, didn't you?"

Riley inhaled slowly, feeling the echo of what had happened in the clearing.

The weight of it.

The way the wolves had looked at her, not as prey, not as an enemy but as something else.

She swallowed. "They knew me."

Kieran exhaled, shaking his head. "No. They recognized you."

The words settled deep.

Like truth.

Like inevitability.

She had spent so long searching for answers, trying to piece together the fragments of her past, to understand why the ruins had called to her, why the visions had come back, why she had been brought back at all.

And now?

She wasn't just finding answers.

She was becoming them.

A sharp wind rustled through the trees, and for a brief second, she swore she heard something beneath it.

A whisper.

A voice.

You know what you are.

Riley's breath came slow and steady.

Yes.

She did.

And Tobias did, too.

That's why he was afraid.

That's why he had spent so much time trying to hunt her, control her, erase her.

Because once, a long time ago this had belonged to her.

And now, she was taking it back.

Kieran studied her, something unreadable flickering in his golden eyes. "You're different now."

Riley turned to face him fully. "No. I think I'm finally the same."

Kieran swallowed hard. "That's what scares me."

Riley's chest ached, but she didn't let it show. "I'm not your enemy, Kieran."

He let out a quiet, humorless laugh, shaking his head. "I know that." His gaze darkened. "But I don't think you realize how easy it would be for that to change."

She stared at him.

Because she understood what he meant.

He wasn't just talking about her.

He was talking about them.

The past. The war. The choices that had already been made once before.

She took a step closer, lowering her voice. "Then stay with me. Make sure I don't become the thing you're afraid of."

Kieran's breath hitched.

For a second, he almost looked like he believed her.

Then

A sound.

Low. Distant.

But unmistakable.

A howl.

Not one.

Many.

Riley's pulse spiked.

Kieran's entire body went rigid.

He turned toward the trees, his head tilting slightly, listening. "They're close."

Riley swallowed hard, her chest tightening not with fear, but with certainty.

This was it.

The war wasn't waiting anymore.

It had just arrived.

She let out a slow breath, steeling herself.

Because she wasn't running.

Not this time.

She turned to Kieran, her green eyes burning.

"Then let them come."

The words left her lips, steady and unshaken, but the moment they did, the air around her seemed to change.

The weight of what was about to happen pressed down on her like a gathering storm.

Kieran's golden eyes searched her face as if waiting for her to take it back, to show hesitation, to prove even for a second that she wasn't ready for this.

But she didn't.

She couldn't.

Because she was done running.

Another howl split through the night closer this time.

Kieran turned sharply, his body going rigid, his hands curling into fists. "That's not just a warning."

Riley's pulse thrummed. "No."

This wasn't Tobias sending a message.

This was Tobias coming for her.

The air turned colder, sharp with the scent of wolves, of pine and rain, of something dark and inevitable.

Footsteps echoed behind them.

Lena.

She stepped onto the crumbling ledge of the watchtower, arms crossed, her golden eyes glinting with interest rather than concern.

"Well, sweetheart," she murmured, "looks like you got his attention."

Riley exhaled slowly, her fingers twitching at her sides. "Good."

Lena smirked. "Then I assume you have a plan?"

A plan.

Riley should have had one.

She should have been calculating escape routes, counting how many wolves they had on their side, figuring out how much time they had before the trees broke open with blood.

But she wasn't thinking about any of that.

She wasn't thinking about running, or hiding, or how to survive the night.

She was thinking about the wolves in the clearing, the ones who had already acknowledged her, the ones who had chosen to wait, to listen instead of attack.

She was thinking about what Marcus had said.

"If you wanted them, they're already yours."

A slow breath filled her lungs.

The howls were getting closer, the wind shifting as more wolves closed in, but she wasn't afraid.

Because this was the moment Tobias had been trying to prevent.

The moment she stopped being hunted.

The moment she stood her ground.

She lifted her chin. "I'm not running."

Lena's smirk widened. "Now we're talking."

Kieran let out a sharp breath beside her. "Riley"

But she was already moving.

Toward the edge of the clearing.

Toward the wolves in the trees.

Toward the pack that had once been Tobias's.

Because tonight, everything would change.

No more running.

No more waiting.

No more pretending she wasn't meant for this.

The wind carried another howl through the trees, but this time, it wasn't just Tobias's wolves calling for blood.

It was the ones who had already started to turn toward her.

The ones who had felt the shift, the ones who had hesitated in the clearing, the ones who deep down had always known.

Kieran moved beside her, close enough that she could feel the tension rolling off him, his breath sharp and uneven. "Riley, think about this."

She did.

And for the first time in her life, it made sense.

She wasn't trapped.

She wasn't powerless.

She was claiming what had always been hers.

Riley took another step forward, toward the darkness, toward the war, toward the wolves waiting for her

And she didn't look back.

The night swallowed her whole, the shadows curling around her like they had been waiting for her to return. The scent of wolves thickened, the earth beneath her humming with something ancient, something inevitable.

She felt the weight of every step, the pulse of something powerful and restless in her veins.

She wasn't just walking toward them.

She was becoming something else.

Something they would have no choice but to follow.

Or fear.

A final breath left her lips as she crossed the threshold, stepping into the dark.

And this time she wasn't coming alone.
###chapter 39: Blood and Allegiance
The forest breathed around her, thick with the scent of wolves and something older, something deeper.

Riley moved without hesitation, without fear. She was done being hunted.

Now, she was the one they were waiting for.

The night was alive with shadows shifting between the trees, bodies moving in silence, golden eyes flickering like embers in the dark. Tobias's wolves.

But not all of them.

She could feel it now.

Some still followed him.

Some were still loyal.

But others?

Others were waiting to see what she would do.

Waiting to see if she was the one they had been missing all along.

Kieran moved beside her, his breath slow, and controlled, but she could feel the anger coiled beneath his skin.

"You don't have to do this," he murmured, low enough that only she could hear.

Riley's fingers curled at her sides. "Yes, I do."

Kieran exhaled sharply, shaking his head. "You don't even know what you're stepping into."

She glanced at him, green eyes burning. "Neither do they."

A flicker of frustration, fear, or something else crossed his face, but he didn't argue.

Because he knew.

They had already crossed the point of no return.

A movement in the darkness caught her attention.

Then a shape emerged.

Broad shoulders. A slow, measured gait. Golden eyes that burned with something too sharp to be amusement, too calm to be rage.

Tobias.

Riley's pulse didn't spike.

It didn't falter.

Because she wasn't afraid of him.

Not anymore.

Tobias came to a stop just feet away from her, his lips curving into something that wasn't quite a smirk.

"Well," he said smoothly. "I was wondering when you'd stop running."

Riley didn't blink. "I was wondering when you'd stop pretending you had control of them."

A muscle in Tobias's jaw twitched, but his expression didn't crack.

Riley saw it, though.

The way some of the wolves behind him shifted.

The way some of them barely smelled like him anymore.

Tobias wasn't just here to remind them of their place.

He was here because he was losing his grip on them.

And they both knew it.

Tobias tilted his head slightly. "So what's the plan, then?" His golden gaze flickered past her, toward the wolves watching from the shadows. "You think you can just take them?"

Riley smiled, slow and sharp. "I don't have to take anything."

Tobias exhaled through his nose, something cold curling at the edges of his smirk. "You don't get it, do you?"

He stepped closer, just enough that the space between them tightened, his voice lowering.

"They're not looking for a leader, Riley. They're looking for a winner."

The words settled deep, pressing against her ribs like a challenge.

She felt it then the shift in the air.

It wasn't about who had the strongest claim.

It was about who would walk away standing.

Kieran stiffened beside her. "This isn't necessary."

Tobias didn't even look at him. "It's the only thing that ever mattered."

Riley held Tobias's gaze, her pulse steady.

Then, softly, she asked, "Is that how you took them from me before?"

The smirk on Tobias's lips faltered.

For a second, just a second his golden eyes darkened.

And that was all the confirmation she needed.

She had been their leader once.

She had stood where he stood now.

And Tobias had taken it.

Riley inhaled slowly. "Then let's finish what you started."

A slow, dangerous silence stretched between them.

Then Tobias smiled.

"Fine," he murmured.

Then he lunged.

The Breaking Point

The impact came fast, too fast.

But Riley didn't stumble.

She moved with it, twisting at the last second, sidestepping the first strike as Tobias's claws barely missed her ribs.

She reacted before she thought, her body moving on instinct.

Because she had fought him before.

Because she had known about this fight once, long ago.

Tobias came at her again, faster this time, but she was ready.

She blocked, spun, countered.

The wolves around them were silent, watching.

Not interfering.

Because this wasn't about them anymore.

This was a fight for dominance.

A fight for who they would follow.

Tobias snarled, his movements sharper now, angrier.

But Riley wasn't angry.

She was focused.

She dodged another strike, then struck back, her claws raking across his shoulder. The scent of blood hit the air.

And the moment it did everything changed.

The watching wolves reacted.

Some flinched.

Some leaned forward.

Some of the ones who had been waiting were still completely asleep.

Riley saw it.

Felt it.

They weren't watching Tobias anymore.

They were watching her.

And Tobias saw it too.

His golden eyes flashed, and suddenly he wasn't attacking out of strategy anymore.

He was attacking out of desperation.

Because he was losing.

And he knew it.

Riley let out a slow, steady breath, dodging the next strike, twisting, moving faster than before.

Then she struck.

Hard.

Tobias's body hit the ground.

Silence.

The air was thick and electric.

Riley stared down at him, her breath heavy, her body still thrumming with power.

She had won.

But that wasn't the part that mattered.

The part that mattered was what happened next.

She could feel the wolves watching.

Waiting.

Tobias had lost.

And that meant they were no longer his.

Riley swallowed hard, the weight of the moment pressing into her.

Marcus's words came back to her, sharp and inevitable.

"If you want them, they're already yours."

She lifted her gaze.

And the wolves bowed.

It wasn't instant.

It wasn't a choreographed movement, some display of loyalty forced upon them.

It was hesitant at first, some shifting uncertainty, others watching the fallen Alpha as if waiting for him to rise, waiting for him to snarl, to reassert control

But Tobias didn't move.

He stayed where he had fallen, his breath ragged, his body trembling from the force of their fight. His golden eyes flickered, shifting between her and the pack that had once been his.

And he saw it.

The moment he had lost them.

Riley felt it, too.

The wolves weren't looking at Tobias anymore.

They were looking at her.

Then, one by one, they lowered their heads.

Not in fear.

Not in defeat.

In recognition.

It sent a sharp pulse of something electric through her.

Not power.

Something older, heavier, undeniable.

A memory buried deep inside her bones, stirring like an ember brought back to life.

She had stood here before.

She had won before.

And now, she was taking it back.

Kieran hadn't moved beside her, but she could feel the weight of his stare, the storm of emotions tangled behind his golden eyes.

She knew what he was thinking.

What this meant.

What she had just become.

But she couldn't focus on that now.

Not yet.

She stepped forward, her breath slow, controlled, until she stood over Tobias.

He stiffened.

Not in pain.

In rage.

His fingers curled into the dirt, his body trembling from the effort of keeping himself upright.

She could see the sheer defiance in his gaze, the refusal to accept what had just happened.

"You think this is over?" he rasped, voice raw, barely more than a growl.

Riley tilted her head slightly. "I think it was over the second your pack stopped looking at you."

A sharp snarl ripped from his throat.

But even now, as wounded as he was, as furious as he was he didn't lunge for her.

Because he knew.

If he challenged her now he wouldn't walk away.

And he wasn't willing to die for this.

That was the difference between them.

She would have.

The moment she stepped into the clearing, she had already accepted her fate.

Tobias never had.

Riley exhaled softly, then she turned away.

Tobias's breath caught.

"You're sparing me?" he asked like he couldn't believe it.

She didn't look back.

"I'm not you."

Then, without another word, she faced the wolves still watching her.

Waiting.

Because they knew what she had to say next.

What she had to do next.

She had claimed victory.

Now, she had to claim them.

Her chest tightened, something sharp curling beneath her ribs as the weight of the moment settled fully onto her shoulders.

She hadn't wanted this.

She hadn't planned for it.

But this had never been about what she wanted.

It was about who she was.

She inhaled slowly.

Then she spoke.

"I am not Tobias," she said, her voice steady, certain. "I will not lead you the way he did."

Silence.

The wind stirred around them, a single leaf spiraling to the ground between her and the waiting wolves.

Riley took another step forward, closing the last of the space between them.

"But if you follow me, know this"

She let her gaze drift over them, letting every one of them feel the weight of her next words.

"There is no running from what's coming."

Some shifted uncomfortably.

Others stayed still.

Waiting.

"If you choose to follow me," she continued, voice like a knife cutting through the cold night air, "then you choose to stand. To fight. To end what should have ended long ago."

She let the words settle.

She saw the ones who hesitated.

The ones who already knew their answer.

And the ones who were still waiting to see if she meant it.

Her gaze flickered once more to Tobias, still crouched in the dirt, his breath heavy but silent now.

Then, she turned back to the pack.

And extended her hand.

A moment passed.

Then another.

Then

A single wolf stepped forward.

It was one of the first to lower its head when Tobias had fallen. A tall, lean male with thick gray fur and piercing amber eyes.

He didn't speak.

He didn't ask questions.

He just lowered himself to one knee.

A murmur spread through the crowd.

Another wolf followed.

Then another.

And another.

Riley's breath came sharp and steady as one by one, they knelt.

Not out of weakness.

Not out of fear.

But out of recognition.

They weren't just accepting her.

They were accepting what she had always been.

And just like that, the war had changed.

Tobias had lost his army

And Riley had just gained one.

The weight of it settled deep in her bones, a quiet, steady hum beneath her skin.

This wasn't just about winning.

This wasn't just about survival.

This was a reckoning.

She let her gaze drift over them, the wolves who had once been Tobias's, the ones who had chased her, hunted her, doubted her.

And now?

They belonged to her.

The fire inside her didn't rage this time.

It burned slowly. Controlled. Powerful.

Because this was what Tobias had feared.

Not her strength.

Not her return.

But the fact that she was never supposed to lose them in the first place.

A slow, sharp breath left her lips.

And as the last wolf bowed, she knew

There was no stopping this now.
###chapter 40: The Shadow of a Queen
The night was silent.

Not with peace. Not with stillness.

But with acceptance.

Wolves still knelt before her, their heads lowered, not in submission but in recognition.

This wasn't just about dominance.

It wasn't about Tobias losing his hold on them.

It was about history repeating itself.

Or maybe history correcting itself.

Riley exhaled slowly, her breath curling into the cold air like smoke. She should have felt overwhelmed, suffocated by what had just happened.

Instead, she felt steady.

Like she had been waiting for this moment without even knowing it.

She lifted her gaze to Tobias, still on his knees in the dirt, his breath heavy, his body worn from the fight.

He didn't look at her with rage anymore.

Not even with defiance.

He just looked at her like someone who had always known this was inevitable.

And maybe it had been.

Tobias let out a sharp breath, tilting his head slightly as he studied her. "You think this makes you better than me?"

Riley arched a brow, her voice calm. "I think this makes me the one who's still standing."

A muscle in Tobias's jaw twitched.

Then he laughed.

A rough, sharp sound that lacked amusement.

He wiped a hand across his bloody mouth, exhaling through his nose. "You have no idea what you've just done."

Riley didn't blink. "No. I think you're the one who has no idea what comes next."

Tobias's eyes darkened. "You think taking my wolves means you've won?"

Riley tilted her head slightly, watching him. Waiting.

Tobias chuckled again, shaking his head.

"Then you don't know who the real enemy is."

Something in his voice made the air go still.

The wolves behind her shifted, uneasy.

Kieran stepped closer, his body still rigid with tension. "What are you talking about?"

Tobias looked up at them now, and for the first time, Riley saw something different in his gaze.

Not rage.

Not even hatred.

Something closer to warning.

"You think this ends with me?" he murmured.

Riley's fingers twitched. "You were the one hunting me."

Tobias scoffed, rolling his shoulders. "No, little wolf. I was the one trying to keep you from being found."

Riley's breath caught.

A slow, cold dread curled inside her, sinking into her ribs like a knife.

She didn't speak.

She just waited.

Tobias exhaled sharply. "You're not the only one who remembers what you were." His golden gaze flickered in the dark. "And now that you've done this now that you've made yourself a threat again they'll come for you."

A slow, visceral chill spread down Riley's spine.

Not because she was afraid.

But because somewhere deep inside her she already knew he was right.

Kieran took a step forward now, his voice sharp. "Who?"

Tobias's lips curled slightly, but it wasn't a smirk. It was something colder.

"The ones who erased her the first time."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Riley felt her chest tighten, her breath coming slower, heavier as if the very air around her had changed.

Because Tobias wasn't lying.

She felt it.

That strange pull in her bones, the memory of something bigger than this war, bigger than Tobias, bigger than anything she had ever understood.

It wasn't just the pack she had once ruled.

It was something older.

Something that had seen her rise before.

And had made sure she fell.

Riley swallowed hard, forcing herself to hold Tobias's gaze. "Who are they?"

Tobias exhaled. "The ones who decide who gets to stay in power." His eyes narrowed slightly. "And you, little wolf? You were never meant to come back."

The words sent a sharp pulse of heat through her blood.

Riley clenched her fists, but she didn't break.

She didn't falter.

Because whoever they were, whatever they had done to her

She was still here.

She had still won.

And she wasn't afraid of them.

Kieran turned to her now, his golden eyes storm-dark with something heavy.

"We need to leave."

Riley inhaled slowly. "No."

Kieran's jaw tightened. "Riley"

"I'm not running."

He clenched his fists. "You don't understand what this means."

Riley turned to face him fully, her gaze unwavering.

"I understand perfectly."

Because Tobias had tried to erase her.

He had hunted her, chased her, tried to bury her in the past where she belonged and he had failed.

Now, someone else would come.

Someone who thought they could erase her again.

But they didn't know her.

They didn't know what had changed.

What she had become.

Riley lifted her chin slightly, a slow fire curling through her chest.

"Let them come."

The wind stirred around them, the wolves watching, still waiting.

For her command.

For her next move.

For her war.

Tobias let out another rough, quiet laugh. "You think you can win this time?"

Riley exhaled slowly.

And then-she smiled.

"I don't think so."

She stepped closer until she could see the flicker of unease beneath Tobias's mask of indifference.

"I know."

Because she was done losing.

She was done being erased.

And this time?

.She was going to end it.

The wind howled through the clearing, sweeping through the gathered wolves, rustling through the trees like a whisper of something ancient something that had been waiting for this moment just as much as she had.

Tobias's smirk had vanished, replaced by something colder, heavier.

A flicker of something like acceptance.

He had fought.

He had lost.

And now, he knew this wasn't his war anymore.

It was hers.

Kieran was still beside her, still stiff with tension, but he wasn't stopping her anymore.

Because he knew too.

He had known before anyone else.

That she wasn't the same girl he had met in Silverwood.

She wasn't a lost soul fumbling in the dark, trying to understand what she had become.

She was something bigger.

Something stronger.

Something that had been here before.

And this time, she wasn't going to be erased.

Riley turned her gaze to the wolves watching, still waiting.

They had chosen her.

Not because she had beaten Tobias.

Not because she had proved she was stronger.

But because they remembered.

Even if they couldn't explain it, even if they didn't know why

They knew her.

And they were waiting for her to lead.

A slow, deliberate breath filled her lungs.

She had taken back the pack.

But this wasn't just about them anymore.

Because Tobias had given her something more valuable than his wolves.

He had given her a name.

A warning.

A glimpse of the true enemy.

The ones who had erased her before.

The ones who would come now, the moment they realized she had risen again.

A slow heat curled beneath her ribs.

Let them.

She was ready.

For the first time in a long, long time

She was exactly where she was meant to be.

The realization settled deep in her bones, like a key clicking into place. The weight of everything, the past, the power, the wolves waiting for her command didn't suffocate her.

It felt right.

The fire inside her raged wildly, and no longer fought to be controlled. It burned steady now, sharp and sure.

Because she wasn't running from it anymore.

She was claiming it.

Riley exhaled slowly, lifting her chin, letting the moment settle.

She turned to Tobias one last time, the man who had tried to bury her in history, the man who had fought so hard to keep what he had stolen.

But he wasn't the story anymore.

She was.

"You can leave," she told him, her voice calm, certain. "Or you can stay and watch how this ends."

Tobias's golden eyes flickered. His body tensed like he wanted to argue like he wanted to throw one last challenge at her.

But he didn't.

Because there was nothing left to fight for.

She had already won.

Tobias let out a slow breath, wiping the blood from his mouth. "You have no idea what's coming for you."

Riley's lips curled slightly, but it wasn't quite a smile.

"Then they should be afraid."

She turned away from him, her gaze sweeping across the pack of the wolves who had once belonged to Tobias, who had once served him without question.

Now, they were hers.

A slow murmur rippled through them, a shift, a silent acknowledgment of what had just happened.

Of what she had just become.

Kieran stepped forward, his golden eyes locked onto hers, storm-dark with something unreadable. "What now?"

Riley let the question hang between them.

Because that was the real thing, wasn't it?

She had taken back the pack.

She had stood her ground.

She had survived.

But surviving wasn't enough anymore.

She wasn't here just to exist.

She was here to end this.

The fire inside her pulsed, steady and strong.

She looked at Kieran, at Lena, at the wolves still watching her.

Then, softly, she said

"We get ready for war."

The words settled over the clearing like a thunderclap, rippling through the gathered wolves, sinking into the cold night air like a promise or a threat.

No one spoke.

No one questioned.

Because they all felt it.

The shift.

The inevitability of what was coming.

Riley saw it in their eyes, in the way their bodies tensed, in the way some looked relieved, and others looked afraid.

Because this wasn't just a fight anymore.

This wasn't about Tobias.

This was about something bigger than all of them.

Something that had been waiting in the shadows, watching, waiting for the moment she became strong enough to be noticed again.

And now?

Now, they saw her.

Riley turned to Kieran, to Lena, to the wolves who had chosen her. She was done reacting.

She was done being hunted.

If war was coming she would meet it head-on.

And this time?

She wasn't fighting alone.
###chapter 41: Echoes of the Fallen
The ruins stood before them, jagged and broken, swallowed by ivy and time.

The towering archway, once carved with precision, was now fractured and cracked, the stones beneath Riley's feet uneven and damp. This place was older than Silverwood, older than the war, older than her own memories.

And yet, she knew it.

She didn't just recognize the shape of the ruins or the symbols etched into the crumbling walls.

She felt them.

Like a ghost of a memory buried deep inside her chest, clawing its way to the surface.

"You've come back."

The whisper wasn't real.

It hadn't come from the trees. It hadn't come from Kieran, or Lena, or the pack standing just behind her.

It had come from the ruins themselves.

And that terrified her more than anything.

Riley swallowed hard, forcing her feet forward, even as the air grew heavier around her.

Every step felt like walking into the past.

Every breath felt like a memory waiting to be unearthed.

Kieran was at her side in an instant, his golden eyes sharp, watchful. "Riley"

"I'm fine," she said, but her voice came out too quiet.

Because she wasn't fine.

None of this was fine.

She could feel something beneath her skin, thrumming like a second heartbeat, pulling her deeper into the ruins.

And the worst part?

She didn't want to fight it.

She wanted to know.

She wanted to remember.

Even if it meant learning the truth she had spent lifetimes running from.

The pack followed her in silence, their footsteps barely making a sound against the damp earth.

They were cautious. Not afraid, but close.

Because they could feel it, too.

The hum in the air.

The way the ruins weren't just a place but a presence.

Somewhere behind her, Lena let out a slow, amused breath. "Well, sweetheart, if you were looking for a bad idea, I think you've found it."

Riley didn't turn around. "You didn't have to come."

Lena chuckled. "And miss this? Not."

Riley exhaled, steadying herself, but it didn't help.

The closer she got, the more everything inside her unraveled.

She wasn't just walking toward the ruins.

She was returning to them.

The past was waiting.

And this time, it wasn't going to let her leave without remembering.

The moment Riley crossed the threshold, the air shifted.

Not physically.

Not with wind, or sound, or anything tangible.

But something inside her snapped open, like a door that had been locked for centuries had just been thrown wide.

She gasped, stumbling forward.

Kieran's hands were on her arms in an instant, steadying her. "Riley!"

She barely heard him.

Because the second she touched the stone

Everything changed.

She wasn't in the ruins anymore.

She was somewhere else.

A throne room, carved from obsidian and silver.

Golden banners hanging from the ceiling, flickering in the torchlight.

And standing before her

A man with golden eyes, watching her with something close to regret.

Her breath caught.

Not Kieran.

Not Tobias.

Someone else.

Someone she should have remembered.

"You don't have to do this," he said, his voice quiet. Pained.

She took a step back, heart pounding. "Who are you?"

The man flinched.

Then, slowly, he exhaled, shaking his head. "You don't remember."

Riley's pulse roared.

She had been here before.

She had stood in front of him before.

And she had trusted him.

Right before he betrayed her.

The vision shattered around her.

She stumbled back into the present, her body shaking, her lungs burning.

Kieran was still holding her, his grip tight, grounding. "Riley, what the hell just happened?"

She couldn't answer.

Because she knew now.

The first betrayal wasn't Tobias.

It wasn't the war.

It wasn't even the pack turning against her.

It was him.

The man in the vision.

The one she had loved once.

The one who had handed her over to the ones who had erased her.

And if he was still out there

If he was still watching

Then her return wasn't just a threat.

It was a challenge.

A slow, sharp breath left her lips.

This war wasn't just about survival anymore.

It was about finishing what had been started.

And this time, she wasn't going to lose.

The realization settled into her bones like fire, slow and consuming.

She had spent so long searching for answers, clawing through half-remembered visions, trying to piece together a past that had been stolen from her.

Now, she finally knew the truth.

She had been betrayed.

Not by Tobias.

Not by the pack.

By someone else.

Someone she had trusted.

Someone she had loved.

Her fingers curled into fists, the weight of the memory pressing against her chest, thick and suffocating.

If he was still out there

If the ones who had erased her were still watching, waiting, waiting for her to remember

Then she had just done exactly what they had feared.

She had woken up.

And this time, she wasn't going to let them take her again.

Kieran's golden eyes searched her face, worry flickering behind them. "Riley, talk to me. What did you see?"

She exhaled sharply, grounding herself, feeling the ruins thrumming beneath her feet.

"A piece of the past," she murmured.

Lena tilted her head, interest flickering in her gaze. "A good piece or a bad one?"

Riley's lips curled, but it wasn't a smile.

"Depends on who you ask."

She turned back toward the ruins, the shadows stretching wide and endless before her.

This wasn't over.

It was only just beginning.

Because whoever he was, wherever he was he would know.

The moment she touched the ruins, the moment the memories returned, the moment she remembered him

He would feel it.

And that meant, for the first time in a long, long time

He was afraid of her now.

And he should be.

Because she wasn't the same girl he had betrayed.

She wasn't the girl who had trusted blindly, who had believed in him, followed him, loved him.

That girl had died.

And the one standing here now, the one who had clawed her way back, the one who had taken back her pack, the one who had shattered the chains of the past was coming for him.

The ruins hummed beneath her feet, pulsing with something old, something alive.

A connection. A link. A warning.

Wherever he was, he had felt it.

He knew she was back.

And now, she knew exactly what she needed to do.

Kieran stepped closer, his breath steady but his body rigid with unease. "Riley, who is he?"

She turned to face him, green eyes burning with something relentless.

"The one who started all of this," she said.

Her voice was calm.

Certain.

Unforgiving.

"And the first one I'm going to end."

The words left her lips like a vow unshaken, absolute, final.

Kieran's breath hitched, just barely, but he didn't look away.

Neither did she.

Because there was no going back now.

She had spent too long trying to understand who she was, too long questioning, doubting, searching.

Now, she knew.

And knowing meant there was only one path left to take.

Lena let out a low whistle from behind them. "Damn, sweetheart. I don't know who this mystery traitor is, but I almost feel bad for him."

Riley's lips curled, but there was no humor in it. Only fire.

"Don't."

Because whoever he was wherever he was

He wasn't just her past anymore.

He was her unfinished war.

And she was going to finish it.

No matter what it took.

The weight of those words settled deep in her chest, but this time, it didn't feel suffocating. It felt like purpose. Like a fire that had been waiting too long to burn, like a storm that had finally gathered enough strength to break.

She had spent too much time being a step behind, too much time reacting instead of acting.

Not anymore.

Now, she was the one moving first.

Now, she was the one hunting.

Kieran's jaw clenched, his golden eyes stormy. "And what happens when you find him?"

Riley met his gaze without hesitation.

"Then I remind him why he should have left me buried."

A flicker of something unreadable passed across Kieran's face worry, frustration, something else she couldn't name.

But he didn't argue.

Because he knew.

Just like Lena knew.

Just like every wolf standing behind her knew.

There was no stopping this now.

She had been erased once.

But this time?

She was the reckoning.

And reckoning didn't hesitate. It didn't ask for permission. It didn't wait for the right moment.

It came like a storm fast, merciless, inevitable.

Riley felt it inside her, the power humming beneath her skin, the certainty settling in her bones like she had been waiting for this moment long before she even knew it existed.

She wasn't afraid of the past anymore.

She was walking straight into it.

Kieran exhaled sharply, raking a hand through his hair, his muscles still coiled tight like he wanted to stop her like he wanted to pull her back from the edge.

But they both knew

She had already stepped over it.

And she wasn't looking back.

Lena smirked, shaking her head. "Well, sweetheart, I hope whoever this bastard is knows what's coming for him."

Riley's lips parted, voice steady, sharp, undeniable.

"He will soon enough."

The wind howled through the ruins, carrying her words into the night.

Somewhere, he would hear them.

Somewhere, he would know.

And for the first time, he would be the one running.
###chapter 42: A Ghost in the Dark
The wind howled through the ruins, carrying whispers of something old, something waiting.

Riley stood at the threshold of the past, her pulse steady, her breath slow, but inside, she was burning.

She had always been chasing shadows, trying to piece together a story she barely understood, but now?

Now she was the shadow.

Now she was the one haunting.

And the one who had betrayed her, the one who had given her up, erased her, buried her in time, was about to learn what it meant to be hunted.

Kieran stood close, his presence solid and unshaken, but she could feel the tension in him.

He didn't trust this.

Didn't trust the ruins.

Didn't trust the way they seemed to breathe beneath her touch, pulling her in, whispering memories she hadn't asked for.

"Riley," Kieran murmured, his voice low, careful. "If you do this, there's no going back."

She met his gaze, green eyes burning like embers.

"There was never going to be a way back."

Not for her.

Not for the past.

Not for the war that was already breaking free from the grave Tobias had tried to keep it in.

Lena stepped beside them, arms crossed, her smirk sharp but curious. "So, are we walking into certain death or just playing with ghosts tonight?"

Riley exhaled. "Maybe both."

Lena grinned. "My favorite kind of plan."

The wolves behind them were silent, waiting.

They had followed her this far.

But now, they needed to see if she would lead.

If she would step into the dark first.

Riley turned back toward the ruins, the stone cold beneath her fingertips, humming beneath her skin.

A presence. A memory. A challenge.

And then she stepped inside.

The moment she crossed the threshold, the air changed.

It was colder here, heavier like the very walls had been holding their breath for centuries, waiting for her return.

Dust and decay filled the air, but beneath it beneath the scent of time and abandonment was something else.

A lingering trace of something ancient.

Something hers.

Her fingers brushed along the stone, and a sharp pulse of energy shot through her.

A gasp tore from her lips as the world tilted.

And suddenly, she wasn't in the ruins anymore.

She was somewhere else.

A hall.

Towering pillars. Firelight flickering against obsidian walls.

A throne at the end of the room silver, jagged, waiting.

And before it, a man.

His back was to her, his shoulders broad, his golden cloak draped over his frame like it belonged there.

Like he belonged there.

Her pulse pounded.

She knew him.

Even without seeing his face, she knew him.

Her voice caught in her throat. "Who are you?"

The man stiffened.

Then, slowly he turned.

And golden eyes met hers.

Not Kieran's.

Not Tobias's.

Someone else.

Someone worse.

Because the moment their gazes locked, everything inside her remembered.

Pain.

Betrayal.

Blood on her hands.

Blood on his.

And then the vision shattered.

Riley hit the ground hard, her breath ripping from her chest, her heart hammering like it was trying to break free from her ribs.

Kieran was beside her in an instant, his hands gripping her arms, his voice urgent. "Riley! What the hell just happened?"

She gasped, shoving herself upright, her fingers digging into the dirt like she could steady herself against the weight of what she had just seen.

What she had just remembered.

Lena knelt beside her, eyes narrowed. "You went somewhere, didn't you?"

Riley swallowed, her throat dry. "I saw him."

Kieran's grip tightened. "Who?"

She met his gaze, her own still wild, still burning with the remnants of the past.

"The one who betrayed me."

Silence.

Cold, thick, unchanging.

Kieran's jaw locked, his golden eyes flickering with something sharp.

"Do you know his name?"

Riley exhaled slowly, her hands still shaking, the echoes of the memory still clawing at the edges of her mind.

She didn't just know his name.

She had spoken it before.

Had whispered it in trust.

Had screamed it in betrayal.

Her lips parted

And then, the ruins groaned.

The very walls shook, dust and stone trembling beneath some unseen force, the air thickening around them.

And suddenly, she knew.

He knew she was here.

He had felt it.

Just like she had felt him.

Kieran's body went rigid, his senses sharpening. "We need to move."

Lena was already up, already scanning the dark, her smirk gone now, replaced with something colder. "Something's waking up."

Riley pushed herself to her feet, breath steady now, her heartbeat no longer frantically certain.

Because whoever he was

Wherever he was

He wasn't running from her anymore.

He was coming.

And this time?

She was ready.

The ruins trembled beneath her feet, the air thick with something alive, something watching.

She could feel him now.

Not just the memory of him. Him.

Somewhere beyond the walls of time, beyond the shattered edges of what had been erased, he was moving.

Because he knew.

He knew she had woken up.

He knew she had remembered.

And that meant this war was no longer waiting.

It was here.

Kieran's hand hovered near her wrist, not grabbing her, not pulling her back, but ready. Ready for whatever came next, ready to fight, ready to follow her into whatever dark place she was about to step into.

Lena's lips pressed into a thin line, her sharp golden gaze scanning the ruins like she could see whatever was stirring in the shadows.

The wolves behind them stood still, waiting for her command.

Because she was their leader now.

And leaders didn't hesitate.

Riley exhaled slowly, steadying herself, feeling the ruins shift around her like they were making space for her return.

Because she had been here before.

Because this place remembered her just as much as she remembered it.

She turned to Kieran, her green eyes burning in the darkness.

"It's time."

Kieran didn't question her.

Neither did Lena.

Because they knew

This was just the beginning.

The air around them tightened, charged with something unseen, something that had been waiting for her return.

The ruins groaned beneath her feet as if shifting to accommodate her presence as if they had been asleep for centuries and were only now waking up with her.

She wasn't afraid.

Not anymore.

Because this time, she wasn't stepping blindly into the past.

She was claiming it.

Kieran's golden eyes flickered in the dim light, scanning the shadows, his body tense and poised for a fight that hadn't come yet.

But it would.

Because if she could feel him he could feel her.

Whoever he was.

Wherever he was.

The past wasn't distant anymore.

It was here.

Breathing. Watching. Closing in.

Lena cracked her knuckles, the corner of her lips twitching, though her usual smirk was tinged with something sharper anticipation.

"Well, sweetheart," she murmured, glancing toward the depths of the ruins. "I hope you know what you're doing."

Riley inhaled deeply, letting the weight of the moment settle over her like armor.

"I do," she said.

Because for the first time, she wasn't running.

She wasn't lost.

She was exactly where she was meant to be.

And this time, she was going to finish what was started.

No more stolen memories.

No more unanswered questions.

No more letting someone else control the story.

The ruins whispered around her, a low hum vibrating beneath her skin, welcoming her back or warning her away she wasn't sure which.

But it didn't matter.

She was here.

And so was he.

Somewhere beyond the veil of time, beyond the edges of what she could see, he was watching.

Waiting.

For her next move.

Kieran shifted beside her, his breath slow but his hands clenched at his sides. She could feel the weight of his stare, the silent question lingering between them.

"Are you sure?"

But he didn't ask it.

Because he already knew the answer.

Lena exhaled sharply, rolling her shoulders. "Alright, princess. You've got a whole pack of wolves waiting on you. What's the plan?"

Riley turned to the wolves standing behind her pack now.

They were waiting.

And she wasn't going to make them wait any longer.

A slow, steady breath filled her lungs.

She lifted her chin.

"We go deeper."

A ripple of tension spread through the group, but no one hesitated.

Because they knew.

This wasn't just about finding answers anymore.

This was about what came next.

And whatever was waiting for them in the dark

She was ready for it.

For the ghosts.

For the truth.

For him.

The ruins seemed to exhale around her, the wind shifting through the cracks in the stone, carrying whispers of something ancient, something restless.

The past had been waiting long enough.

Now, it was time to face it.

Riley took the first step forward, and her pack followed.

No hesitation.

No turning back.

Because this wasn't just a journey into the ruins.

It was a descent into everything that had been stolen from her.

And she wasn't leaving without taking it back.
###chapter 43: Descent into Shadows
The ruins welcomed her in silence.

No sudden gusts of wind. No growling echoes from the past. Just the weight of everything waiting beneath the surface.

Riley moved forward, her steps slow and deliberate, the ground uneven and cold beneath her boots. The air inside the ruins was different, thicker, heavier, and charged with something unseen.

It smelled of damp stone, of earth untouched by time, of a place that had been left to rot and yet refused to die.

Her wolves followed behind her, their presence steady but uneasy. Even Kieran, who was usually unshaken, had tensed beside her.

Because they all felt it.

Something was wrong here.

Something was waiting.

But Riley didn't stop.

Because she had waited long enough.

The deeper they went, the narrower the passage became, the walls closing in as vines snaked through the stone, twisting like veins.

Golden torchlight flickered against the damp stone, casting long, twisting shadows that seemed to move even when nothing else did.

Somewhere behind her, Lena exhaled sharply.

"Well," she muttered, voice low but edged with amusement. "This place just screams 'bad idea.'"

Riley didn't smile.

Because Lena was right.

This was a bad idea.

It was a trap.

A grave.

A challenge.

And yet, she couldn't turn back.

Because if she did she would never know.

Never know the truth.

Never know who she had been before they erased her.

Never know what he had done to her.

And she was done living in the dark.

A slow chill slid down her spine, an ache curling behind her ribs, like something just beyond her reach was calling out to her.

Then

A sound.

Low.

Distant.

Like stone shifting.

The pack froze.

Kieran moved closer, his golden eyes scanning the dark. His voice was low, edged with tension. "Something's down here."

Riley's fingers twitched at her sides, her pulse steady, calm.

She already knew that.

Because whatever was down here, it wasn't just something.

It was someone.

The passageway opened suddenly, widening into a vast underground chamber.

At the center stood a massive stone structure, cracked and covered in ivy.

Not a temple.

Not a ruin.

A tomb.

Riley's breath caught.

Because she knew this place.

Even if she had never seen it before, she had been here.

Not in this lifetime.

But in another.

Her knees almost buckled beneath her, the weight of recognition slamming into her like a tidal wave.

Lena let out a low whistle. "Well, that's not ominous at all."

Kieran was silent.

Because he could see it too.

The writing.

The faded, carved letters are etched into the stone.

The language was old, older than anything that should have existed here.

And yet

She understood it.

She didn't know how.

But she did.

Her lips parted, the words falling from her mouth before she could stop them.

"She who was taken shall rise again."

The second the words left her lips the ground trembled.

The torches flickered.

The air shifted.

And from the far end of the chamber

A shadow moved.

Riley's breath hitched.

Because she wasn't imagining it.

Someone was standing in the darkness beyond the tomb.

Watching.

Waiting.

She could feel his presence before she saw him.

A slow pulse of recognition burned beneath her skin, like a tether stretched too tight, like a memory just out of reach.

And then

He stepped forward.

Tall.

Draped in black.

Golden eyes burning like fire beneath the hood of his cloak.

Riley's entire body is locked up.

Because she knew those eyes.

She had seen them in her vision.

She had seen them in her past.

She had seen them when he betrayed her.

Kieran moved beside her, muscles tensing, claws flexing. "Who the hell is that?"

The hooded figure didn't speak.

Not at first.

He just stood there, watching her, studying her like he had been waiting for this moment as long as she had.

Then, finally

He smiled.

And when he did, it sent ice through her veins.

Because it wasn't cruel.

It wasn't mocking.

It was familiar.

"It's been a long time, hasn't it?"

His voice was smooth, steady, like the ruins themselves had given him the words.

Riley's chest ached.

Because she should have hated him.

She should have lunged for him, should have torn through him like he was the last thing standing in her way.

But instead

She hesitated.

Because something inside her some terrible, forgotten part of her was still tied to him.

And she didn't know how to cut the thread.

The Betrayer's Name

The silence stretched between them, thick, suffocating.

The pack was still behind her, waiting.

Kieran was beside her, a storm barely contained.

But none of it mattered.

Not right now.

Not when she was standing in front of the one who had started it all.

Riley swallowed hard, her voice coming out softer than she wanted.

"Who are you?"

The man tilted his head slightly like he was amused by the question.

"Don't you remember?"

Her pulse roared in her ears.

She did.

The name clawed at the edges of her mind, tangled in the broken pieces of her past, aching to be spoken.

She had whispered it once.

She had screamed it once.

And now, it came back to her like a knife through the ribs.

"Caius."

The moment she spoke, the ruins shook.

Caius smiled wider and for a split second

Riley saw the truth.

He wasn't just someone from her past.

He was someone she had once fought for.

Someone she had once loved.

And someone who had destroyed her anyway.

The weight of it hit like a tidal wave.

She had spent so long chasing shadows.

And now, one of them had stepped into the light.

Because Caius wasn't a memory anymore.

He was real.

And he was standing right in front of her.

Waiting.

Watching.

And the worst part?

He wasn't afraid.

Not of her.

Not of the pack behind her.

Not of Kieran, who was seconds away from ripping him apart.

And that made Riley's blood run cold.

Because he should be.

He should have been afraid the moment she spoke his name, the moment she remembered who he was, the moment he saw the fury building inside her, the fury of a girl who had been erased, betrayed, buried in time, and left for dead.

But instead

He smiled.

This was exactly what he had been waiting for.

Like he had always known she would find him again.

Like he had never once doubted that she would come back to him.

Riley's hands curled into fists, her breath sharp and measured, her heart pounding like a war drum.

"Say something," Kieran growled beside her, his golden eyes burning. "Before I rip your throat out."

Caius's gaze flicked to him, amusement flickering across his face.

"Easy, Wolfe," he said, voice calm like he was speaking to a reckless child. "I wouldn't want you to get yourself killed over something you don't understand."

Kieran snarled, stepping forward, but Riley lifted a hand.

Not to protect Caius.

To stop Kieran from making a mistake.

Because she knew that tone.

That unshaken certainty.

Caius wasn't just confident he was assured.

Like he had already calculated every outcome.

Like he had already won.

And that meant one thing.

He wasn't alone.

A low growl rumbled through the ruins.

Not from Kieran.

Not from the pack.

From the shadows.

Then movement.

Figures emerging from the darkness, silent and steady, their golden eyes flickering beneath cloaks the color of midnight.

Wolves.

But not hers.

Not Tobias's.

Something else.

Something older.

Something that made the airdrop ten degrees, that made the ruins themselves seem to shrink, that made even the most hardened of her wolves step back.

Riley didn't move.

She wouldn't flinch.

Not in front of him.

Not in front of the ones who had come for her.

She held his gaze, steady and unrelenting.

"You should be dead," she said.

Caius laughed.

Soft, slow, like she had just told him a secret only he understood.

And then, calmly

"So should you."

The words struck like a blade to the ribs.

Because he was right.

She had died.

Somewhere in the tangled wreckage of the past, she had fallen, she had bled, she had lost.

And yet

Here she stood.

And so did he.

Why?

Riley's breath came slow, measured. "What happened to me?"

Caius studied her for a long moment, and then

He took a step forward.

Not like a threat.

Not like a challenge.

Like a ghost crossing a threshold.

Like he had always been meant to stand here, in front of her, waiting for her to finally see him.

"You don't remember?" he murmured.

Riley's nails bit into her palms. "Not all of it."

Caius tilted his head slightly. "Then let me remind you."

The air shifted.

Something cold and electric crawled over her skin, something that made her pulse skip, something older than memory itself.

And then

He reached for her.

Kieran lunged, but Caius was faster.

His fingers brushed against Riley's temple

And everything shattered.

The Memory That Was Stolen

Pain.

White-hot, searing, all-consuming.

She was falling.

The world was burning.

And he was there.

Caius.

Not as an enemy.

Not as a stranger.

As someone she had loved.

As someone who had sworn to protect her.

And yet he had betrayed her.

The memory unfolded like a nightmare.

A throne room in ruins.

The scent of blood in the air.

The sound of wolves howling in agony.

And she was on her knees.

Gasping, bleeding, hands trembling as Caius stood over her, golden eyes unreadable.

"I'm sorry."

The words ripped through her.

She tried to move.

Tried to stand.

Tried to fight.

But the moment she reached for him, the moment she looked into his eyes and saw the choice he had made

The knife was already in her chest.

And he was the one holding it.

The vision ripped away like a gust of wind tearing through her mind.

She collapsed, gasping, shaking, the ruins spinning around her.

Caius was watching her, his expression unreadable.

But he wasn't sorry.

Not anymore.

Riley staggered upright, chest heaving.

And the fury inside her cracked open like wildfire.

"You killed me," she breathed.

The words felt foreign and familiar all at once.

Caius didn't flinch.

"You left me no choice."

Riley snarled, lunging

But before she could reach him before she could tear him apart like she should have centuries ago

A new sound echoed through the ruins.

A deep, resounding howl.

Not from her wolves.

Not from Tobias's.

From him.

And suddenly they weren't alone anymore.

The shadows came alive.

A force too big, too powerful, too ancient.

Caius had brought an army.

Not to fight her.

To reclaim her.

Because this was never about killing her.

It was about taking her back.

And Riley wasn't going anywhere.

Not with him.

Not with the ones who had erased her before.

Not back into the dark, where she had once been forgotten.

Her pulse roared in her ears, every muscle coiling tight and ready, but Caius only watched her.

Waiting.

Like he already knew the choice she was about to make.

Like he thought this had already been decided.

Like she was his to reclaim.

Riley bared her teeth.

"You think I belong to you?"

Caius's golden eyes burned.

"You always have."

A growl ripped through the ruins not from her, not from the wolves behind her, but from Kieran.

His body was rigid, his claws extended, his breath slow and dangerous.

"You have three seconds to get the hell out of here," he said, his voice a low snarl. "Before I tear your throat out."

Caius barely acknowledged him.

His attention was still on Riley, still steady, still expectant.

"You don't understand," he murmured, taking another step closer, his voice almost gentle.

Riley didn't move.

Didn't flinch.

Didn't breathe.

Because she knew what came next.

She could feel it in her bones, in the ghosts of memories clawing at the edges of her mind.

This wasn't over.

This wasn't even the true fight.

This was just the first move.

And the war she had been trying to outrun for lifetimes

Had just begun.
###chapter 44: The War That Never Ended
The air in the ruins was thick with silence.

Not empty.

Not still.

Waiting.

For a decision. For the first strike. For the moment everything that had been buried broke free.

Riley stood in the center of it, her heart pounding like a war drum, her breath slow, controlled, even though every instinct inside her screamed to act.

Caius stood before her, his golden eyes steady and unreadable, his presence too calm for a man who had just admitted to betraying her.

For a man who had once stood over her with blood on his hands.

And behind him, in the depths of the ruins, the shadows moved.

Figures stepped forward, their presence slow and deliberate, cloaked in darkness, golden eyes gleaming from beneath their hoods.

Not wolves.

Not Tobias's pack.

Something else.

Something ancient.

Riley's pack shifted behind her, their bodies tense, low growls vibrating through the air, but they didn't move first.

Because this wasn't just a fight.

This was a claim.

A moment that would decide who she was and where she belonged.

And Caius knew it.

That was why he wasn't attacking.

That was why his wolves weren't lunging.

Because he wasn't here to kill her.

He was here to take her back.

And Riley wasn't sure which was worse.

Caius took another step forward, slow, deliberate. Measured.

"You feel it, don't you?"

Riley stiffened.

Because she did.

It was crawling under her skin, curling around her ribs, sinking into her bones like it had always been there.

A pull.

A connection.

The past was trying to close in on her, dragging her back to where she had been before.

Before Tobias. Before Kieran. Before she died.

But she wasn't that girl anymore.

She wasn't someone to be erased.

She wasn't something to be claimed.

Her jaw tightened, fingers twitching at her sides. "I feel nothing."

Caius exhaled softly, shaking his head. "Liar."

The word settled deep.

Because he was right.

She had spent so long searching for the truth, clawing at the broken pieces of her past, and now here it was.

Standing in front of her.

Calling her back.

But she wasn't going.

Kieran moved beside her, muscles tensed, claws extended. "You need to leave," he growled, voice low, controlled. "Now."

Caius finally turned his gaze to Kieran, something sharp flickering behind his golden eyes.

"You're protective," he murmured. "That's sweet."

Kieran's snarl deepened, his golden eyes flashing dangerously. "I'll be something else if you take one more step."

Caius smirked.

Like he was amused.

He didn't see Kieran as a threat or worse like he already knew how this would end.

Riley's blood turned to fire.

Because that was the problem, wasn't it?

Caius had been waiting for this.

He had known she would come.

And now that she was here, he wasn't leaving without her.

She took a slow breath, steadying herself.

Then, she stepped forward.

Kieran stiffened beside her, but he didn't stop her.

Because this was hers.

Her past.

Her war.

She met Caius's gaze, steady and unyielding.

"I don't belong to you."

Caius smiled, but this time, it wasn't amusing.

It was something softer.

Something worse.

"You did once."

Riley's chest ached.

Because the past wasn't just chasing her anymore.

It was standing right in front of her.

Waiting for her to remember.

Waiting for her to choose.

But her choice had already been made.

She inhaled, sharp and certain.

"Not anymore."

Caius tilted his head, studying her like she was something fragile like she was something to be handled carefully.

Like she was his.

And then

He sighed.

"Shame," he murmured.

And then he moved.

Fast.

And this time she was going to finish it.

The ruins trembled beneath her feet, a slow pulse of energy thrumming through the cracked stone like an ancient heart beating for the first time in centuries.

Something had changed.

Something had woken up.

Not just her memories.

Not just her past.

Her power.

The air between them thickened, charged with something deep and raw, something that had been buried alongside her history.

Caius had felt it too.

His golden eyes flickered not with fear, but with something close to understanding.

Like he had been waiting for this moment.

Like he had known it would come.

And that infuriated her.

Because he wasn't supposed to look at her like that.

Like he still had the upper hand.

Like he still believed he had a claim to her.

Riley bared her teeth, her claws curling at her sides.

"You don't get to stand there and act like you know me," she hissed.

Caius tilted his head slightly. "Don't I?"

Rage curled inside her.

Because the worst part?

He did know her.

Once.

Before he had taken everything from her.

Before he had killed her.

Before he had left her buried and forgotten.

But now

Now, she was standing here, alive.

And she was going to make him pay for every second she had been erased.

Caius exhaled slowly, flexing his fingers, blood dripping from the wound she had carved into his shoulder.

"You're different," he murmured, voice calm.

Riley smiled, sharp and deadly.

"Good."

Then she attacked.

She moved faster this time not just with instinct, but with certainty.

Caius dodged, but not fast enough.

She struck again, claws slicing through the fabric of his cloak, forcing him back, forcing him to react.

Forcing him to realize

She wasn't fighting like she had before.

Because she wasn't just a girl reclaiming her past.

She was a wolf reclaiming her throne.

And Caius had just lost his.

The moment his blood hit the ground, the ruins trembled.

Not just from the fight.

Not just from the power unraveling between them.

But from something older.

Something that had been waiting.

A shift rippled through the air, deep and ancient, the kind of change that couldn't be undone.

And Riley felt it.

Caius did too.

For the first time, his golden eyes darkened not with confidence, not with amusement but with something colder.

Something close to realization.

Because this wasn't like last time.

This wasn't like before.

Before, he had been the one with the power.

Before, he had been the one controlling the outcome.

Before, she had been his to destroy.

But now

Now, the ruins didn't recognize him.

They recognized her.

The power curling in the air wasn't his.

It was hers.

Caius took a slow step back, his fingers flexing, blood still dripping from his wound.

A second ago, he had been standing in front of her like he had already won.

Now, he was reconsidering.

Riley felt it settle inside her, the truth sinking deep into her bones.

He thought he could claim her.

But she wasn't his to take.

She never had been.

And now, he finally understood that.

She took a step forward.

Caius still.

Not in fear.

But in recognition.

Like something inside him was finally catching up to the reality of what had just happened.

He exhaled softly, his golden gaze flickering across her face, searching.

"You really don't remember everything yet," he murmured, voice quiet.

Riley's nails dug into her palms, fury curling beneath her ribs.

"I remember enough."

Caius held her gaze. Unmoving.

Then, after a long, slow moment

He smiled.

Not in amusement.

Not in arrogance.

But like someone who had just lost a battle but knew the war was far from over.

"Not yet," he said simply.

And then he moved.

Not to attack.

Not to fight.

To retreat.

The moment his wolves saw him step back, they followed.

A calculated, controlled withdrawal.

Like he hadn't just lost

Like he had seen enough.

Like he had gotten what he came for.

Riley's breathing was heavy, her muscles coiled, her blood still burning with the need to finish this.

But something inside her held her back.

Because this

This wasn't over.

Caius had let her win this fight.

But he wasn't gone.

He was waiting.

Watching.

And the next time they met

She wouldn't just be remembering the past.

She would be rewriting it.

Not as the girl who had been erased.

Not as the ghost of a past they tried to bury.

But as the one who would burn it all down and build something new.

The ruins still trembled, as if they, too, had felt the shift as if they knew the war had just changed.

The wolves around her stood frozen, watching Caius and his forces disappear into the darkness. Not fleeing. Not afraid. But waiting.

Like they already had another plan.

Like they already knew this wasn't an end, but a beginning.

Riley's chest heaved, her breath sharp, but she forced herself to stand taller.

To hold the ground she had just won.

The wind howled through the open archways of the ruins, rustling the ivy that clung to the crumbling stone.

She wasn't just standing in a graveyard of the past.

She was standing where something had once been stolen from her.

And now, she was taking it back.

Kieran stepped closer, his golden eyes dark and storming with emotions she couldn't name.

"Why did he leave?" he asked, voice quiet but edged with something rough.

Riley didn't answer right away.

Because the truth was she didn't know.

Caius had walked away, not because he feared her, not because he had lost, but because he had seen something.

Something in her.

And that was what unsettled her the most.

Lena let out a low whistle, rolling her shoulders. "That was fun. Let's never do it again."

Riley exhaled sharply, grounding herself. "This isn't over."

Lena smirked. "Yeah, sweetheart, I got that part."

Kieran's gaze never left her.

"Are you okay?" he asked, voice lower now, steadier, but still weighted with something unspoken.

Riley clenched her jaw.

She wanted to say yes.

Wanted to tell him she was fine.

But she wasn't.

Because Caius was supposed to be her enemy.

And yet, when she had looked into his eyes

Something inside her had remembered him.

Not just as a traitor.

Not just as the one who had betrayed her.

But as something else.

Something dangerous.

Something unforgivable.

And that realization sat like ice in her chest.

Kieran's fingers curled at his sides, his jaw tightening. "Riley."

She swallowed hard.

Then she turned to face the wolves still watching her.

Still waiting for her next move.

Because they had followed her here.

They had chosen her.

And now, they needed to know what came next.

She lifted her chin.

"We're done letting them control the game."

The pack stilled.

The words settled.

She wasn't just talking about Caius.

She was talking about all of it.

Tobias.

The ones who had erased her.

The war that had never truly ended.

Kieran's expression was unreadable. "And what exactly do we do now?"

Riley's lips curled, slow and sharp.

She turned back toward the ruins, toward the history she refused to be a prisoner to.

"We take back what was ours."

And this time no one was going to stop her.

Not Caius.

Not Tobias.

Not the ghosts of the past that still whispered through the ruins.

She had spent too long being hunted, too long running from answers, too long being a step behind the forces pulling the strings of a war she had been born to win.

That ended now.

The wolves around her could feel the shift, the certainty.

They had followed Tobias because they thought he was strong.

They had hesitated before choosing her because they weren't sure she was.

But now?

Now they knew.

Because she wasn't just a leader.

She was a reckoning.

She was the war itself.

Lena smirked, her golden eyes glinting in the moonlight. "Sweetheart, I gotta say something is terrifying about you when you make that face."

Riley glanced at her. "Good."

Kieran was still watching her, his golden eyes unreadable, but he didn't look at her like the others did.

Not with fear.

Not with hesitation.

With understanding.

Because he knew.

Because from the moment he had met her, from the moment she had stepped into the world of wolves and war, this was always where she was meant to end up.

Kieran exhaled sharply. "Then tell us what comes next."

Riley turned to face them all-the wolves who had once been her enemies, the ones who had watched her rise from the ashes of a past that refused to let her go.

She let the silence stretch, let the weight of the moment settle over them like a blade waiting to strike.

Then, she gave them her answer.

"We stop playing by their rules."

"We make our own."

The wind howled through the ruins.

And Riley knew wherever Caius was, he had felt it.

The first true war had just begun.

And this time she was the one they should fear.

Because she wasn't just reclaiming her past.

She was rewriting the future.

The ruins stood silent behind her, the echoes of history shifting, changing, bending to her will.

The wolves before her watched, waiting not with doubt, not with hesitation, but with trust.

Because she had proven herself.

Because they had seen what she was capable of.

Because they knew, just as she did

This war wouldn't be won by the strongest.

It would be won by the one who refused to break.

And she would never break again.
###chapter 45: The Fire That Follows
The ruins still pulsed with the remnants of power, the air thick with the weight of everything that had just happened. The battle had ended, but the war had only just begun.

Riley stood at the center of it all, heart pounding, breath slow, feeling the weight of a thousand choices pressing down on her.

She had won.

She had driven Caius back, forcing him to retreat.

But he hadn't left in fear.

He had left knowing something.

Something she hadn't figured out yet.

That alone sent a slow, sharp unease curling through her veins.

Because if he wasn't afraid, it meant he still had control over something.

And whatever that was

She had to take it from him.

The pack was still watching her, standing at the edges of the ruins, their golden eyes reflecting the flickering torchlight.

They had followed her this far, but now?

Now, they needed more than just a leader.

They needed a reason to keep fighting.

A reason to believe this war wasn't already lost.

She turned to face them, her pulse steady, her voice clear.

"I won't lie to you," she said, scanning the crowd. "What happened tonight wasn't a victory."

Some of the wolves shifted uneasily.

But she wasn't here to comfort them.

She was here to tell them the truth.

"Caius left because he wanted to," she continued. "Because this was never the real fight. Because he thinks he's already won."

She let the words settle.

She let the weight of them sink into the silence.

Then she took a step forward.

"But he's wrong."

A flicker of something passed through the pack, a spark, a question.

Good.

"Do you feel it?" she asked, her voice quieter now. "The shift? The way the ruins responded to me?"

No one spoke.

But they felt it.

She could see it in their eyes.

The understanding.

The acceptance.

The slow realization that the past wasn't just something to be uncovered.

It was something that could be rewritten.

"We're not just fighting against him," Riley said. "We're fighting against the ones who erased me before. The ones who controlled Tobias. The ones who still believe they own this war."

She let the silence stretch, let the wind carry the weight of her words.

"Let them believe that," she murmured. "Let them think they still hold the leash."

Her gaze sharpened.

"Because the moment they see what we've become it'll be too late for them to stop us."

A low growl rumbled through the crowd, the tension shifting.

Not fear.

Not uncertainty.

Something else.

Something dangerous.

Something ready.

Lena let out a low whistle, smirking. "Damn, sweetheart. That was almost inspiring."

Riley shot her a look, but she could see it in Lena's eyes.

She wasn't mocking her.

She was impressed.

And so was the rest of the pack.

Kieran stepped forward, his golden eyes dark and unreadable. "So what's the plan?"

Because that's what they needed now.

Not speeches.

Not just words.

A plan.

And Riley had one.

She had spent too long playing defense.

It was time to move first.

She lifted her chin.

"We find out what Caius is after," she said. "And then we take it from him."

A Past Worth Burning

The pack didn't hesitate.

They moved as one, leaving the ruins behind, following Riley through the thick forest.

They didn't need to ask where they were going.

Because they already knew.

If there were answers to be found, they weren't in the ruins anymore.

They were in the one place Tobias had always refused to let her see.

The Alpha's estate.

Silverwood had always had secrets, but none ran deeper than the ones buried inside the walls of the pack's fortress.

And Riley was done waiting for permission.

The moonlight barely pierced through the thick canopy above them, but she could see perfectly.

She could feel everything.

The presence of the wolves at her back.

The distant, lingering scent of Caius's wolves, now miles behind them.

The heartbeat of the forest itself.

She was awake now.

And nothing could stop her from taking what was hers.

The estate was just ahead, the massive structure barely visible through the trees.

Kieran slowed beside her. "Are we sure about this?"

Riley didn't hesitate. "No."

Lena grinned. "Good enough for me."

They reached the perimeter, where the dense forest met the open clearing of the estate's grounds.

The pack fanned out, silent, waiting.

Tobias had ruled from inside those walls.

Caius had hunted her from the shadows beyond them.

And now?

She was walking straight through the front door.

Kieran's jaw tightened. "If we do this, we don't get to undo it."

Riley exhaled slowly.

"Then let's make it count."

A reckoning in the dark 

The first guard never saw her coming.

One moment he was standing watch

The next, Riley slammed him into the ground.

No time for hesitation. No time for warnings.

They had been hunting her since the beginning.

Now, it was her turn.

The pack swept forward, silent and lethal, slipping through the shadows like they had always belonged here.

And maybe, in a way, they had.

Riley moved fast, slipping past the outer walls, her heart steady, her pulse even.

The estate was built from stone and wood, an old fortress that had stood long before Tobias had ever called himself Alpha.

It had always felt like a cage.

Tonight, it felt like a battlefield.

Kieran caught up beside her. "Where are we going?"

Riley didn't hesitate.

Down.

To the part of the estate that only Tobias and his most trusted wolves had ever seen.

To the part that held secrets, no one had ever spoken of.

To the part where, if she was right

She would finally learn why they had erased her in the first place.

The halls were eerily silent as they moved deeper into the fortress.

But Riley could feel it.

The presence in the dark.

The watching eyes.

Then

A door.

Heavy, iron-bound, old as the estate itself.

Her fingers grazed over the surface, and a sharp shock of energy pulsed through her.

Recognition.

A memory trying to surface.

This door.

She had been here before.

And whatever was on the other side

It was meant for her.

Kieran glanced at her, waiting.

Lena cracked her knuckles, grinning. "I swear, if there's some ancient monster in there, I'm gonna be pissed."

Riley huffed a quiet breath.

Then

She pushed the door open.

And everything changed.

The chamber beyond the door was vast, lined with torches that burned too bright, too strong.

And at the center

A massive stone tablet.

Not just any tablet.

A history.

Her history.

Carved into stone, telling the story they had tried to erase.

She stepped forward, her heart slamming against her ribs.

The words were in a language she shouldn't have understood.

But she did.

Because they were hers.

And they told the truth.

The truth of who she had been.

The truth of who Caius had been.

And the truth of why he had betrayed her.

Riley inhaled sharply.

Because in that moment, as the past unraveled before her, one thing became clear.

Caius hadn't been hunting her just to kill her.

He had been hunting her because he was afraid.

Afraid of what she would become if she remembered.

Afraid of the war she would bring to his doorstep.

And now?

Now he had every reason to be afraid.

Because Riley wasn't just going to win.

She was going to burn them all down.

Every lie.

Every secret.

Every piece of the past they had buried and thought she would never find.

The truth was carved into the stone before her, etched into time itself.

And now that she had seen it, there was no undoing it.

The flickering torchlight cast deep shadows across the chamber, making the carvings on the tablet shift and move as if they were alive.

Riley's breath came slow and steady, but her pulse was roaring.

Because this wasn't just history.

This was a warning.

Lena stepped up beside her, her golden eyes scanning the tablet. "So, sweetheart, you gonna tell us what's got you looking like you just saw a ghost?"

Riley swallowed hard.

Because in a way she had.

She turned to face them, her pack standing behind her, Kieran closest of all, his body tense with expectation.

They were waiting.

Waiting for her to explain.

Waiting for her to give them their next move.

Waiting for her to step into the truth of who she was.

She let the silence stretch.

Then, finally, she spoke.

"They didn't just erase me."

Her voice was quiet, dangerous.

"They erased an entire war."

Kieran's expression darkened. "What are you saying?"

Riley turned back to the carvings, her fingers tracing the edges of the stone.

"I'm saying this war didn't start with me and Tobias. Or even with Caius."

Her green eyes burned as she looked at them.

"It started long before any of us were reborn into it."

A slow, sharp hush settled over the chamber.

And then

The ground shook.

Not like before.

Not from the weight of memory.

But from something alive.

Something that had felt her return.

Something that had been waiting for her to remember.

And Riley knew

She had just woken up to something far worse than in the past.

The tremors beneath her feet weren't random.

They weren't just the shifting of old stone or the weight of time pressing down on forgotten history.

This was something alive.

Something ancient.

Something waiting.

The pack tensed around her, their golden eyes flickering in the dim torchlight.

Kieran stepped closer, muscles coiled, his stance protective. "Riley," he said carefully. "Tell me that's just the ruins settling."

Riley exhaled, slow and steady.

"It's not."

The carvings on the stone tablet glowed.

Faint, barely noticeable, but enough to make the breath catch in her throat.

And then the words moved.

Not physically.

Not in a way that should have been possible.

But the symbols on the stone shifted and twisted, forming new shapes, and new meanings.

Like they were rewriting themselves for her.

Like they had been waiting for her to see them again.

Lena let out a low whistle. "Okay, yeah. Some ancient supernatural bullshit happening right now."

Riley didn't respond.

Because she wasn't just seeing the symbols anymore.

She was remembering them.

The stone beneath her fingers was cold and rough, but somewhere, deep in her bones, she knew what it should have felt like.

Smooth. New.

Like it had been when she had last stood here.

Before everything had been ripped apart.

A sharp breath left her lips as images flashed behind her eyes.

The same ruins but not broken.

The same words but freshly carved.

The same war but not yet lost.

And standing before her

Caius.

Not as an enemy.

Not as the betrayer.

As something else.

Something that made her chest ache in ways she didn't understand.

"You have to trust me."

His voice was soft, urgent, desperate.

"If you stay, they will kill you."

She gasped, ripping herself out of the vision, and stumbling back from the stone.

The ruins groaned around them, the shaking intensifying.

Something was coming.

Something had felt her presence, her memories, her return.

Kieran caught her wrist, grounding her. "What did you see?"

Riley's throat was dry.

But the truth burned inside her now, undeniable.

"They didn't just erase me," she whispered. "They made sure no one would ever find out what happened."

She turned back to the tablet, the glowing symbols reflecting in her green eyes.

"This isn't just history."

She looked at them all now her pack, her wolves, her army.

"This is a warning."

The trembling beneath them grew stronger.

Something was waking up.

Something that had been waiting for her return.

And Riley knew

She wasn't leaving these ruins without a fight.

The shaking grew worse, the deep groan of stone grinding against stone echoing through the cavern like the earth itself was coming undone.

Dust rained from the ceiling, and the torches lining the walls flickered wildly, their flames dancing as if they, too, could feel the shift in the air.

Riley stood her ground.

She had faced Tobias. She had faced Caius.

But this was different.

This wasn't a war waged between rival packs.

This wasn't about dominance, power, or revenge.

This was something older.

Something that I had been watching. Waiting.

And now that she had touched the past, now that she had begun to piece together what had been stolen from her

It had found her again.

Kieran's grip on her wrist tightened. "Riley, we need to move."

But she couldn't.

Not yet.

Because the tablet was still glowing.

Because it was speaking to her.

The symbols burned brighter, and suddenly

A voice.

Not in her head.

Not from the wolves behind her.

From the ruins themselves.

"The past is never buried."

"It only waits."

"And now, it has come for you."

A pulse of pure energy slammed into her chest, knocking her back.

Kieran lunged to catch her, but she barely felt his hands on her shoulders.

Because the moment she hit the ground

The past crashed over her like a tidal wave.

The ruins were gone.

She was somewhere else.

Somewhere golden and burning.

The throne room.

The banners of her kingdom fluttered in the wind, embroidered with symbols she had once known as well as her own name.

And standing before her

Him.

Caius.

But not like before.

Not as the man she had fought.

Not as the enemy she had sworn to destroy.

But as someone who had once stood beside her.

"This was never supposed to happen," he said, his voice raw, his golden eyes dark with something too heavy to name.

Riley felt herself answering.

Not as she was now.

As she had been before.

"Then why did you betray me?"

Caius flinched.

And at that moment, she saw it.

The truth.

The betrayal had never been about power.

It had never been about control.

It had been about saving her.

Or at least, that's what he had believed.

Because in the next instant, the doors to the throne room burst open.

A wave of darkness crashed inside.

Not wolves.

Not soldiers.

Something else.

Something that had come to erase her from history.

And Caius

Caius had chosen their side to stop them from killing her.

But it didn't work.

Because she had died anyway.

The vision ripped away as a deafening crack split the air.

Riley gasped, snapping back into the present, Kieran shouting her name.

The ruins were collapsing.

The past was trying to bury her again.

But this time

She refused to be erased.

She shoved herself upright, eyes blazing.

"We're getting out of here," she said, voice sharper than steel.

Lena cursed. "Finally. Thought you were gonna let yourself get crushed for a second."

The wolves were already moving, following her lead, sprinting for the exit as the ruins continued to shake, stone crumbling around them.

Kieran stayed beside her, his golden eyes flicking toward her, worried, questioning.

But Riley couldn't look at him yet.

Because she wasn't just running out of the ruins.

She was running straight into a truth she could no longer deny.

Caius hadn't betrayed her out of cruelty.

He had betrayed her because he had thought it was the only way to save her.

And now, after all these years

He had come back to finish what he started.
###chapter 46: Shadows of the Past, Flames of the Future
The ruins collapsed behind them in a deafening roar, sending clouds of dust and shards of broken stone spiraling into the night.

Riley didn't look back.

She couldn't.

Her legs carried her forward, her breath burning in her lungs as the forest swallowed them whole, the scent of damp earth and pine thick in the air. The echoes of the ruins' destruction still trembled in the ground beneath her feet.

But that wasn't what was making her chest ache.

It wasn't the crumbling stone, the way the past had tried to bury her again.

It was what she had seen.

What she now knew.

Caius had betrayed her. But not for power.

For her.

The realization pulsed through her, sharp as a blade, lodging itself deep into the parts of her she had locked away for too long.

She had spent so much time hating him.

Wanting to destroy him.

Wanting to make him suffer.

But now?

Now, she didn't know what the hell to do with the truth.

The weight of truth sinks in

They ran until the scent of dust and old magic faded and the weight of the ruins was nothing but a lingering ghost at their backs.

The pack slowed, breathing heavily, their golden eyes scanning the trees for any signs of pursuit.

There was none.

Because Caius hadn't chased them.

Because he hadn't needed to.

Riley knew what that meant.

He had let her leave.

Because whatever had just happened back there whatever had awoken in those ruins

Was exactly what he wanted.

Her fingers twitched at her sides. She was still shaking, though not from exhaustion.

Not from the fight.

But from everything else.

Kieran stopped beside her, his golden gaze sharp, watchful.

"You need to talk to me," he said, voice low.

Riley swallowed hard, keeping her eyes forward.

"There's nothing to say."

"That's a lie," he said, stepping in front of her, and forcing her to meet his gaze. "You saw something back there. When the ruins reacted to you. When the past tried to drag you under. You saw something, Riley."

She didn't answer.

Because if she said it out loud, it would make it real.

But Kieran knew.

He always knew.

Lena crossed her arms, watching her carefully. "I swear, if you tell us 'you're fine,' I'm gonna start throwing things."

Riley exhaled sharply.

She wasn't fine.

She wasn't even close.

Because for the first time since she had stepped into this war

She was starting to wonder if she had ever really been on the right side of it.

The pack gathered in a clearing, their breath was still heavy, their bodies tense with adrenaline.

Some wolves sat, trying to steady themselves.

Others paced, restless.

All of them were waiting for her.

Waiting for their leader to speak.

Waiting for her to tell them what came next.

But Riley could still feel the past curling around her ribs, sinking into her blood.

The stone tablet.

The carvings.

The truth.

She had been erased because of the war.

A war that hadn't ended with her death.

A war that had never ended at all.

She looked at them now, the wolves who had followed her through the fire, the ones who had chosen her over Tobias, the ones who had believed in her when she barely believed in herself.

And she knew she couldn't keep the truth from them.

She straightened, drawing in a slow breath, forcing herself to find the words.

"They didn't just erase me," she said finally, her voice even, controlled.

Silence stretched over them.

Not the silence of hesitation.

The silence of listening.

Of understanding that everything was about to change.

Riley exhaled, tightening her fists.

"They erased an entire war."

The wolves shifted.

Kieran's expression darkened. "What do you mean?"

Riley looked at him, her chest tight.

"The fight between Tobias and me? Between Caius and me?" She shook her head. "It's just a piece of something bigger. Something that started long before any of us."

She turned her gaze to the others, making sure they saw her.

"This war has been happening for centuries," she said. "Over and over again. And every time someone gets too close to the truth they erase it."

She swallowed hard, the weight of it pressing down on her.

"They thought they could erase me. That they could bury what I was, what I knew."

She lifted her chin, her green eyes burning.

"But they failed."

A slow, sharp breath rippled through the pack.

Something shifted.

This wasn't just about revenge anymore.

It wasn't just about Caius or Tobias or any of the battles they had been caught in.

This was bigger.

Older.

And Riley was at the center of it.

Lena let out a low whistle, breaking the silence.

"Sweetheart, I don't know if I should be impressed or terrified."

Riley huffed out a breath. "Both."

Lena grinned. "Good. I like a challenge."

But Kieran didn't smile.

His eyes were locked on Riley, his expression unreadable.

"You're saying we're fighting a war we can't even see."

Riley met his gaze.

"No."

She took a slow step forward, letting the truth settle into her bones.

"We're fighting a war they don't want us to see."

The wind shifted, carrying the distant scent of the ruins.

And something else.

Something new.

Or rather something old.

Riley went rigid.

Because she knew that scent.

Kieran stiffened beside her.

Lena's smirk faded.

The rest of the wolves tensed, ears flicking, muscles coiling.

And then

A figure stepped out of the trees.

Not Caius.

Someone else.

Someone with eyes like fire and a presence that felt like death.

The pack closed in, ready to fight.

But the figure only smiled.

And Riley knew this was the moment everything truly changed.

Whoever this was

They weren't here to kill her.

They were here to remind her why she had been erased in the first place.

And why she would never be allowed to rise again.

The figure took another step forward, the shadows shifting around them as if the very night itself bent to their presence. The scent they carried wasn't just wolf it was something else.

Something older.

Something that made the wolves behind Riley stiffen, their instincts screaming danger before the figure even spoke.

Riley clenched her fists, every muscle in her body wound tight. She had faced Tobias. She had faced Caius. But this was something entirely different.

Because this wasn't an enemy from the past.

This was an enemy from the beginning.

The one who had made sure she never lived long enough to finish what she started.

The figure smiled, slow and knowing. "So, it's true. You have woken up."

Riley didn't move. Didn't speak.

Because of the voice.

It was familiar.

Not from her life now.

Not from anything she should remember.

But from before.

A ghost of something that had been stolen.

A whisper in the back of her mind, clawing for recognition.

The wind picked up, carrying their scent closer, and suddenly, Riley knew.

She knew who they were.

She knew why they were here.

And she knew

This was the one who had killed her first.

Kieran shifted beside her, tense, ready. "Riley?"

She exhaled slowly, forcing herself to speak. "I know who they are."

The figure tilted their head. "Do you, now?"

Riley lifted her chin, refusing to let the fear curl around her ribs.

"You're the one who started this."

The figure's smile widened.

"And you're the one who was never supposed to come back."

Lena let out a sharp breath, cracking her knuckles. "Alright, sweetheart, I'm starting to get tired of ancient people showing up and talking in riddles. Either fight us or get lost."

The figure chuckled, but it wasn't warm.

It was mocking.

"I see your new wolves are just as reckless as you were before," they mused. "But you don't understand, little Alpha. I'm not here to fight you."

Riley's nails bit into her palms.

"Then why are you here?"

The figure stepped forward, their golden eyes gleaming like embers in the dark.

"To remind you why you lost the first time."

And then

The sky cracked open.

A force unlike anything Riley had ever felt slammed into the clearing, knocking her back, and sending the wolves staggering as the wind howled, thick with energy.

Riley hit the ground, her breath ripped from her chest, the world spinning, distorting.

She gasped, trying to push herself up, but the force was everywhere.

Like the past itself was wrapping around her, pulling her under.

The figure didn't move.

They only watched.

Because they had done this before.

And this time

They weren't going to let her rise.

Not again. Not ever.

The force pressing against Riley's chest was unlike anything she had ever felt ancient, relentless, crushing.

It wasn't just power.

It was a memory.

Not the fragments she had been chasing, not the visions flashing behind her eyes in pieces she barely understood.

This was everything.

And it wanted to drown her in it.

She tried to move, to claw her way back to the present, but the pressure only grew stronger, wrapping around her like unseen chains, dragging her down, down, down.

The world split apart.

She was falling.

Not through air.

Through time.

The sky above her was golden, burning. The banners that once bore her crest were in flames, ripped from the walls of a kingdom that no longer existed.

The sound of wolves howling not in battle, but in agony.

And standing before her, at the center of the chaos, was Caius.

Not as he was now.

Not as the cold, unreadable man who had walked away from her in the ruins.

But as he had been before.

Desperate. Bloodied. Betrayed.

"Riley" No. That wasn't what he had called her then.

That wasn't who she had been.

"You have to leave."

She couldn't move.

Couldn't answer.

Because the memory wasn't finished.

She saw herself.

Standing in front of him, body shaking, blood staining her hands but not her own.

"You did this," she whispered.

Caius flinched. "I had no choice."

And behind him the figure.

The one who had just stepped out of the shadows in the present.

The one who had killed her first.

They had been there before.

Watching. Controlling. Pulling the strings of a war they refused to let end.

And she had died for it.

The memory fractured, shattered, and snapped back into the now.

Riley gasped, her body jolting as she slammed back into the present, the force of it nearly making her collapse.

Kieran was already there, his hands gripping her arms, steadying her.

"Riley!" His voice was sharp, urgent.

She blinked hard, the images still seared into her mind.

Caius.

The war.

The one who had been there to watch her fall.

And now, they were standing in front of her again, waiting to do it all over.

The figure hadn't moved.

They were watching her carefully like they knew exactly what she had just seen.

Like they were waiting for her to understand.

And she did.

She finally did.

"You," she whispered, her breath shaking. "You were there."

The figure tilted their head, a slow smile creeping across their lips.

"Good," they murmured. "You're starting to remember."

A sharp growl ripped from Kieran's chest. "I don't care who you are. You need to leave. Now."

The figure ignored him.

Because they weren't here for Kieran.

They were here for her.

"You weren't supposed to come back," they said softly, almost regretfully. "But now that you have"

The wind howled, tearing through the trees.

And the shadows at their feet began to move.

Not wolves.

Not anything she had ever seen before.

Something worse.

Something that didn't belong in this world.

And Riley knew this wasn't just about her past anymore.

This was about the thing she had been fighting against long before she had even known it existed

And this time, they weren't going to let her escape.

The shadows at the figure's feet lengthened, stretched, and twisted, taking shape in ways that made Riley's stomach churn.

They weren't wolves.

They weren't human.

They were something else entirely.

Their movements were wrong too fluid, too silent, like they weren't bound to the same rules as the rest of the world.

And they were closing in.

Lena's hands flexed at her sides, her usual smirk gone, replaced by something sharp. "I don't know what the hell those things are, but I don't like them."

Neither did Riley.

Because she recognized them.

Not from this life.

But from the memory she had just been forced to relive.

These were the things that had been waiting in the shadows of her past, the ones that had come for her when everything had fallen apart.

And now they are here.

Again.

Because the war had never ended.

Because her death hadn't been enough.

The figure sighed, almost wistful. "You weren't supposed to remember them yet."

Riley's teeth clenched. "Too late."

Kieran shifted closer to her, muscles coiled, his golden eyes locked on the creatures circling them.

"You know what those are?" he asked, his voice low.

Riley swallowed hard, her heart hammering. "Not exactly. But I know what they do."

Kieran's jaw tensed. "Which is?"

Her fingers curled into fists.

"They erase things."

The words hung in the air, thick and heavy.

The pack stilled.

Because they understood.

These creatures weren't just here to kill.

They were here to erase her again.

To make sure she disappeared from history.

To make sure she never had the chance to finish what had started centuries ago.

The figure smiled. "Now you see why I can't let you leave."

Riley lifted her chin, fire building in her chest.

"You don't get to decide that."

The figure exhaled like she had disappointed them. "You always were stubborn."

A slow pause.

Then

They lifted a hand.

And the shadows lunged.

Kieran moved first, slamming into one of the creatures before it could reach her. His claws sliced through its form, but instead of flesh, it was like striking smoke.

The thing twisted, reforming instantly, lashing out.

Kieran barely dodged.

Lena cursed. "Oh, that's some supernatural bullshit."

Another shadow streaked toward Riley, fast and silent.

Her instincts screamed.

She twisted away, bringing up her claws to strike, but the moment she touched it

A flash.

A memory.

A glimpse of herself, centuries ago, facing these same creatures in the same fight that had taken everything from her.

Her breath hitched.

And for a split second, she wasn't here.

She was there.

The golden throne room.

The burning banners.

The sound of wolves dying, their howls mixing with the screams of something not human.

Caius yelled her name.

The sharp, cold edge of a blade pressed to her throat.

"It has to be you."

And then pain.

A crushing force against her chest, her body hitting the ground

"Riley!"

She was back.

She barely had time to react before Kieran shoved her out of the way, claws bared as he tore into the creature that had almost reached her.

Her chest heaved, heart racing.

She had hesitated.

Because of the past.

Because of the memory.

And that hesitation had nearly gotten her erased.

She shoved herself upright, rage slamming through her.

Not fear.

Not confusion.

Rage.

Because they had tried to take everything from her before.

Because they had succeeded once.

But this time she wasn't going to fall.

The figure watched, head tilting slightly.

"Still standing?" they mused. "Impressive."

Riley wiped blood from her lip, green eyes burning. "Get used to it."

The figure smiled.

And then

The real fight began.
###chapter 47: A War Written in Shadows
The night burned.

The fire raged around Riley, swirling and twisting in the air like it was alive, responding to her every breath. The wind carried the scent of smoke, scorched earth, and something darker: the presence of something ancient, something wrong.

The figure stood before her, their golden eyes gleaming in the flickering light. They had barely moved since stepping from the shadows as if they were waiting for her to understand.

But Riley didn't care about understanding.

She cared about finishing this.

Because this war had started long before she had been reborn into it.

Long before she had ever known Caius.

Long before they had erased her name from history.

And tonight, it ended.

The figure exhaled slowly like they could hear her thoughts as they had already predicted her every move. "You've remembered something, haven't you?"

Riley stiffened.

Because they were right.

She didn't know how. She didn't know why. But ever since she had set foot in the ruins, the past had been clawing its way back to her.

Fragments of battles she had never fought.

Memories of people she had never met.

Or at least, people she wasn't supposed to remember.

"You were there," Riley said, her voice low, steady.

The figure inclined its head slightly. "I was."

The fire crackled. The wolves behind her remained silent, waiting for her to make the first move.

Kieran was tense, his body wound tight like a coiled spring, golden eyes flicking between her and the figure assessing, waiting.

Lena, however, had never been one for patience.

"Okay, am I the only one getting tired of this cryptic bullshit?" she muttered, adjusting her stance. "They aren't here to talk. Let's just end this already."

The figure smiled.

A slow, knowing smile.

"As reckless as ever," they mused, eyes flicking toward Lena. "Some things never change."

Lena's expression darkened. "The hell does that mean?"

Riley didn't answer.

Because she knew exactly what it meant.

And she knew what would come next.

The first strike.

A war that was not meant to end 

The figure moved first.

One second they were standing there, calm and composed

The next, they were upon her.

Riley barely had time to react before their hand collided with her chest.

Not a punch.

Not an attack meant to wound.

It was something else entirely.

Something worse.

The moment they touched her everything cracked.

Her mind fractured.

Not like before.

Not like the visions that had flickered in and out of her subconscious, teasing her with glimpses of the past.

This time, it shattered.

The world around her vanished in an instant the fire, the battle, the wolves, Kieran shouting her name.

She wasn't in the forest anymore.

She was somewhere else.

Somewhere she had been before.

The throne of fire 

The golden city was burning.

Flames licked the sky, devouring banners that bore her crest, swallowing the walls of a kingdom that had been built to last forever, and yet it was falling.

Not to war.

Not to a rival kingdom.

To something worse.

The thing they had all pretended wasn't real.

"You have to leave!"

The voice rang through the firestorm, desperate, raw, familiar.

Riley turned but she already knew what she would see.

Caius stood before her, not as an enemy, not as the betrayer she had spent so long hating.

As the man, he had been before.

Before the war had consumed them.

Before he had made his choice.

Blood stained his armor, his golden eyes wild with desperation. "They're coming, and they won't stop until you're erased. If you stay, you die here."

She was breathing too fast.

This wasn't real.

It was a memory.

A trick.

But it felt real.

She could feel the heat of the flames licking at her skin.

The ache in her muscles from battle.

The weight of the blade strapped to her hip, a blade she had forgotten she had ever wielded.

This wasn't just something she was seeing.

She was living it.

"Not without you," she heard herself say, voice steadier than she felt.

Caius's jaw clenched.

"You don't understand," he whispered.

"Then make me."

He hesitated.

And then the throne room doors burst open.

The air turned to ice.

And the figures stepped inside.

Not wolves.

Not men.

The same creatures that had come for her tonight.

The ones who didn't kill.

The ones who erased.

Caius moved instantly, positioning himself between her and them, his body tense, his breathing sharp.

She saw it then.

The choice in his eyes.

The choice she hadn't understood before.

The reason he had betrayed her.

Because he hadn't betrayed her at all.

He had made a deal.

To stop them from taking her.

To erase her before they could.

And it hadn't worked.

Because she had died anyway.

Because nothing he had done had been enough.

The realization slammed into her like a falling star.

And then

The vision fractured.

The War That Never Stopped

Riley hit the ground hard.

Her lungs gasped for air, her body shaking as the firestorm in her head crashed back into the present.

She was still in the forest.

Still standing in the fire.

And the figure was still in front of her.

Watching.

Waiting.

Because they knew what she had just seen.

They had been there.

And for the first time, Riley understood.

This war wasn't new.

It wasn't about Tobias.

It wasn't even about Caius.

It had always been about them.

The ones who erased.

The ones who had been waiting in the shadows of history, rewriting the world until it fit their design.

And Riley?

She was the mistake they had been trying to correct for centuries.

She pushed herself to her feet, her breath steady despite the storm inside her.

"You should have killed me the first time," she said, her voice cold, clear.

The figure exhaled softly.

"We did."

Her heart slammed against her ribs.

"And yet," they continued, tilting their head, studying her. "Here you are."

Riley curled her fingers into fists, fire curling between them.

"You won't get another chance."

The figure's golden eyes darkened.

"Then let's see if you can stop us."

They lifted their hand

And the shadows came alive.

This time, they weren't just coming for her.

They were coming for all of them.

And Riley knew

This wasn't just a fight.

This was the moment history broke apart.

And she was going to be the one to rewrite it.

No more running.

No more being hunted like a ghost in her own story.

No more fighting a war she didn't understand.

Because now she understood everything.

She knew who they were.

She knew what they had done.

And she knew without a doubt that they feared her.

That was why they had erased her.

That was why they had buried her name in the past.

Because she was never meant to rise again.

And yet she had.

The shadows howled around them, twisting, writhing, hungry for destruction. The fire reflected in their shifting forms, golden eyes gleaming from within the darkness.

Riley didn't move.

She stood her ground.

Because the past had taken everything from her before.

Because she had died before.

But this time she wasn't falling.

Kieran moved beside her, his golden eyes fierce, body coiled and ready. Waiting for her command.

Lena twirled a dagger between her fingers, a slow smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. "So, what's the play, sweetheart?"

The rest of the pack was watching her now.

Not Tobias.

Not Caius.

Her.

Waiting.

Because this wasn't just another battle.

This was the war.

The one that had started long before any of them had been born into it.

The one they had been forced into without knowing why.

But Riley knew now.

She knew.

The fire inside her roared, crawling up her arms, licking at her fingertips, pulsing beneath her skin like it had always belonged there.

And maybe it had.

Maybe she had been born to burn.

But this time, she wasn't burning alone.

She turned to her pack, her wolves, her army.

"You want the truth?" she said, her voice steady, cutting through the crackling flames.

They listened.

They were always listening.

"This war isn't about power," she continued. "It isn't about territory, or revenge, or some ancient grudge between Alphas."

She let the words settle, let them sink deep.

"This war is about control. About rewriting history. About making sure none of us remember what we were before they took it from us."

A slow murmur spread through the wolves.

Some of them had suspected it.

But now she was confirming it.

Now, she was giving them the truth they had never been allowed to have.

Her green eyes burned as she turned back to the figure.

"You spent centuries trying to erase me," she said. "But guess what?"

The fire surged, an inferno roaring behind her as if the world itself had been waiting for this moment.

"You failed."

The figure's smile faded.

For the first time, they looked at her not like she was an inconvenience

But like she was a real threat.

Like she was the thing they had been trying to stop all along.

And Riley grinned.

"Now, let's see if you can survive what comes next."

Then, she attacked.

The fire surged with her, roaring to life as if it had been waiting just like she had.

Riley moved like a storm, her body coiling, twisting, striking with a precision she didn't fully understand but felt in her bones. This wasn't a new fight. It was an old one. One she had fought before. One she had lost.

Not this time.

The figure barely had time to react before her flames lashed out, striking with the force of an avalanche. But they didn't flinch.

Instead, they lifted a hand and caught the fire.

Not like before, when they had merely resisted it.

This time, they bent it.

Controlled it.

Turned it against her.

The fire recoiled, twisting midair, shooting back toward Riley in a spiraling inferno of her own making.

She barely had time to throw up her hands, blocking the worst of the impact as heat exploded around her. The force of it sent her staggering back, her heart hammering, her vision swimming through the haze of smoke.

But she didn't fall.

She dug her heels into the ground, gritted her teeth, and pushed back.

The fire around her shifted, answering her call, bending not to them but to her.

She wasn't just a vessel for this power.

She was the fire.

And if they thought they could use it against her they were dead wrong.

Riley forced it forward again, twisting the flames, sending them spiraling toward the creatures emerging from the shadows.

The moment the fire touched them they screamed.

Not human screams. Not animalistic howls.

Something deeper.

Something wrong.

Like the fire wasn't just burning them it was unmaking them.

Riley exhaled sharply. That was it.

That was how she had to fight them.

The past wouldn't save her.

Only becoming something new would.

She turned to her pack, to Kieran, to Lena, to the wolves still holding the line.

"Burn them."

The pack didn't hesitate.

Torches were thrown, and flames ignited. The forest lit up, the night itself turning to fire and smoke.

And Riley ran straight into the heart of it.

The figure was waiting for her, their golden eyes unreadable, their stance steady.

For the first time, they looked serious.

Not amused.

Not entertained.

Seriously.

Like they had finally realized what she was.

Like they had finally realized what she could do.

"You're stronger than before," they murmured.

Riley smirked.

"You sound surprised."

They tilted their head slightly. "Not surprised."

Their fingers flexed.

"Disappointed."

Then, they moved.

Faster than anything she had ever seen.

One moment, they were standing before her.

The next

They were behind her.

Riley barely spun in time, claws up, fire streaking from her fingers as she struck

But they caught her wrist midair.

The second they touched her, her mind fractured again.

The golden city.

The throne room was in flames.

Caius shouting her name.

A blade pierced her ribs.

The sound of her voice screaming

She ripped herself free, gasping, shaking, heart pounding.

The figure hadn't moved.

They had just let her go.

"Still fragmented," they mused. "Still incomplete."

Riley clenched her jaw.

She was done with their games.

She threw herself at them again, her fire blinding, her power surging, pushing harder, burning brighter.

They tried to counter.

But this time

Riley was ready.

She caught them by the throat, her claws pressing against their skin, her fire burning hot enough to scorch the air itself.

Their golden eyes flickered, not with fear, but with something close to recognition.

"Finally," they murmured.

Riley snarled.

"Burn."

And then she let go.

Let go of everything.

The hesitation. The fear. The fragments of who she had been.

She let the fire consume it all.

The flames exploded outward, swallowing them both whole.

The past was burning.

And when the fire died

Only one of them would be left standing.

The fire roared, consuming everything in its path, turning the battlefield into an inferno of writhing shadows and blinding gold.

The heat stung Riley's skin, but she didn't flinch.

Because this time, the fire was hers.

The figure struggled against her grip, their golden eyes flickering not with fear, but with something deeper.

Understanding.

Recognition.

Like, for the first time, they saw her for what she was.

What she had always been.

The mistake they had tried to erase.

The war they had tried to bury.

But Riley wasn't a mistake.

She wasn't a ghost of the past.

She was the one thing they had feared all along.

The one who would end them.

The fire surged higher, hotter, wrapping around the figure like chains of molten gold.

Their lips parted a breath, a final word, a plea.

Riley didn't wait to hear it.

She let the fire take them.

And as they burned, she whispered, "You should've killed me when you had the chance."
###chapter 48: The Ashes of the Past, the Dawn of War
The fire swallowed the battlefield whole.

The night burned, shadows writhing and twisting as flames roared higher, consuming everything in their path.

The figure's golden eyes widened, their body caught in the inferno's grasp. For the first time, they looked uncertain.

Not invincible.

Not untouchable.

Just mortal.

Riley stood at the center of it all, unmoving, unshaken.

The fire didn't hurt her.

Because it wasn't just fire.

It was her.

She had been born in it, erased by it, buried in its embers and now, she was rising from it.

The pack stood frozen behind her, their golden eyes reflecting the blaze, caught somewhere between awe and fear.

Because this wasn't just another battle.

This was the moment everything changed.

The figure's lips parted as if to speak, but Riley was done listening.

"You should've killed me when you had the chance," she murmured.

And then, she let go.

The fire roared, closing in.

The figure twisted, recoiling, trying to fight it, trying to escape.

But there was nowhere left to run.

This wasn't just a battle of strength.

It wasn't just about power.

This was retribution.

This was the end of their story.

They had spent centuries rewriting the past, controlling the truth, playing god over time itself.

But even gods could burn.

And as the flames consumed them, they finally understood.

Riley saw it in their eyes the recognition, the acceptance.

The moment they realized that they had lost.

That she wasn't the girl they had erased.

That she wasn't the weapon they had once controlled.

That she was something else entirely.

And then

They were gone.

The fire burned too bright, too hot, turning them to ash.

And just like that, they were erased from history.

For the first time, Riley had erased them.

The Silence After the Storm

The fire crackled, embers floating into the air like fallen stars.

The wind carried the last remnants of smoke into the night.

And Riley?

She still stood.

Alive.

Unbroken.

Changed.

She exhaled slowly, her body thrumming with something new, something raw, something powerful.

For the first time since stepping into this war, since discovering who she was, she felt whole.

Like she wasn't just chasing the past anymore.

Like she wasn't running from something she didn't understand.

She understood now.

This wasn't just about remembering.

This was about becoming.

A slow hush settled over the battlefield, broken only by the distant crackle of dying flames.

The pack was still watching her, waiting for her to speak.

Waiting for her to tell them what came next.

But for a long moment, she didn't say anything.

Because she had felt it.

In the fire.

In the final moments before the figure had vanished.

She had felt something worse.

A presence still watching.

Still waiting.

Because this wasn't the end.

It was only the beginning.

The War That Had Just Begun

Kieran was the first to step forward, his golden eyes locked onto hers.

"Riley," he said, voice low, steady. Controlled, but edged with something raw.

He had seen it too.

He had felt it.

The truth hangs in the air between them.

Riley swallowed hard.

"It's not over," she murmured.

Lena scoffed, wiping blood from her cheek. "No offense, sweetheart, but what the hell does 'not over' even mean? You just turned that asshole into a pile of ash. That sure looked like an ending to me."

Riley shook her head. "It wasn't."

She turned, scanning the trees, the wind shifting around them. Waiting. Watching.

"The real enemy is still out there," she said.

Kieran tensed. "Caius."

Her chest ached at the mention of his name.

Because after everything, after all the battles and betrayals, after all the hatred she had clung to

She wasn't sure if Caius had ever been the true enemy at all.

Riley exhaled, steadying herself. "Not just him."

She turned back to the pack, her wolves, her soldiers.

"The ones who erased me," she said, her voice steady, sharp as a blade. "The ones who have been controlling this war from the shadows. The ones who did this to all of us."

She lifted her chin, letting the truth settle.

"They're still watching. Still waiting. And now, they know I remember."

A heavy silence stretched through the clearing.

She saw it in their faces the realization, the understanding.

The war they had thought they were fighting was nothing compared to the one coming.

The enemy wasn't just Tobias.

Or Caius.

Or the traitors lurking in the shadows.

It was the ones who had written the past itself.

And Riley?

She was going to tear them apart.

Kieran exhaled sharply, golden eyes unreadable. "Then what do we do?"

The fire flickered in Riley's hands, golden embers curling around her fingers.

She knew exactly what came next.

No more waiting.

No more playing by their rules.

She turned to the pack.

"We take the war to them."

And this time no one was going to stop her.

The air crackled around her, thick with the lingering scent of smoke and something heavier the weight of fate shifting.

The wolves watched her with new eyes.

Not just as their leader.

Not just as the girl who had survived.

But as the one who had set the war in motion.

And Riley could feel it too.

Something inside her had broken open in that fire, something they had tried to erase but couldn't.

Not now.

Not ever again.

Lena exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through her hair. "Alright, sweetheart. I'm with you. But let's be honest who the hell are we fighting now?"

That was the question.

The one that had been hanging in the air since the moment the fire had turned to ash.

Because it wasn't just one person.

It wasn't just Caius or Tobias or the wolves they had spent so long chasing.

This war was older than them.

Older than any of them remembered.

Older than even the ones who had been writing the story in the first place.

Riley straightened, her fingers flexing at her sides.

"They're the ones who made sure I died the first time," she said. "And they're the ones who have been watching ever since."

Kieran's expression darkened. "The ones who control history."

Riley nodded.

The ones who had rewritten the past.

The ones who had erased her name.

The ones who had taken everything.

And now?

She was taking it back.

Her green eyes burned as she turned to her pack, the ones who had followed her through fire and blood, the ones who were still here, still standing.

"They've been playing gods for centuries," she said. "Deciding who remembers. Deciding who disappears. Deciding how this war ends before it even begins."

Her breath curled in the cold night air.

"But they made a mistake."

She took a slow, deliberate step forward.

"They let me come back."

Silence stretched over the pack.

No hesitation.

Not fear.

Something else.

Anticipation.

Kieran met her gaze, steady, unyielding. "Then let's make them regret it."

Riley felt the fire rise again, not around her but inside her.

She lifted her chin.

"We will."

She turned to the horizon, where the night was still heavy, still waiting.

And she knew.

This wasn't just about revenge.

This wasn't just about winning.

This was about taking back the world they had stolen.

And she wouldn't stop

Not until every last one of them burned.

The words settled over the pack like a prophecy, sinking deep into the bones of every wolf standing in the clearing. The fire still smoldered behind them, casting long, twisting shadows, and Riley stood at the center of it all unmoved, unbroken, unstoppable.

The war wasn't coming.

It had already begun.

And this time, it wouldn't end with her being erased.

It wouldn't end with her name being forgotten.

It wouldn't end with them winning.

Because Riley wasn't just a fighter anymore.

She was the thing they had feared all along.

The mistake they had tried to bury.

The force they had tried to control.

The story they could no longer rewrite.

Lena let out a sharp breath, her usual smirk returning, but this time it was sharper, meaner. "Well, sweetheart, if we're doing this, I hope you've got a plan. 'Cause I'm tired of playing defense."

Riley's lips curled. "We don't play defense anymore."

Lena grinned. "That's what I like to hear."

The other wolves shifted, standing taller, watching Riley differently now.

They weren't just waiting for orders.

They were waiting for war.

Kieran stepped forward, golden eyes locked on her, unshaken, unwavering. "Where do we start?"

Riley turned, scanning the dark horizon, where the night stretched endlessly before them.

For so long, she had been searching.

For answers.

For the truth.

In the past, they had stolen from her.

But now?

Now she wasn't looking back.

She was looking forward to it.

And she knew exactly where they needed to go.

"The city," she said. "The one that was mine before they erased it."

Kieran's gaze sharpened. "You think there's something left?"

Riley exhaled.

She didn't just think.

She knew.

"They tried to bury it. Just like they tried to bury me."

She let the fire curl between her fingers, watching as the embers danced in the cold night air.

"But nothing stays buried forever."

She met their gazes, one by one, making sure they saw the truth in her eyes.

"We're going to the ruins of the first war," she said.

She turned toward the night.

"And we're going to finish it."

A slow, rising growl rippled through the wolves.

Not of fear.

Of readiness.

Of war.

The past had been rewritten.

The future was hers to claim.

And this time, when the fire rose

She would be the one lighting the match.

The night pulsed around them, thick with the scent of burning earth and the weight of something new, something inevitable.

The war had always belonged to them.

Now, it was hers to win.

The wolves moved closer, their golden eyes reflecting the dying embers, their bodies tense with anticipation. No one spoke. No one needed to.

Because they understood.

Because for the first time in centuries, the hunted had become the hunters.

Kieran exhaled slowly, his gaze locked on hers. "If we do this, there's no turning back."

Riley lifted her chin.

"Good."

A slow grin crept across Lena's face. "Well, damn. I think I just fell in love a little."

Riley huffed a quiet breath, but her heart was hammering.

Not from fear.

Not from doubt.

From certainty.

She had never felt it before not like this.

She had spent her life searching.

For who she was.

For what had been stolen from her.

For why they had erased her in the first place.

But she wasn't searching anymore.

She knew.

And soon would they.

She turned toward the distant horizon, where the ruins of her past lay buried beneath time and lies.

The city that had once been hers.

The city that still remembered her name.

The city that was waiting for her return.

"We move at dawn," she said.

The pack didn't hesitate.

Because this wasn't just a fight.

This was the reckoning.

And when the sun rose

The world would finally remember Riley Hayes.

No more hiding.

No more running.

No more fighting battles on someone else's terms.

The fire inside her had been reignited, not just in her hands, not just in the ruins they left behind but in her very soul.

The past was done taking from her.

Now, she was taking everything back.

The pack around her was silent, but it wasn't a silence of uncertainty.

It was a silence of understanding.

A silence of readiness.

A silence that carried the weight of wolves who knew that war was no longer something to avoid but something to end.

And Riley?

She was going to end it.

Kieran stepped closer, his golden eyes flickering in the torchlight, his breath steady, controlled.

But she could feel it in him.

The storm beneath his skin.

The unspoken words lingered between them.

He had followed her through fire and blood.

And now he would follow her into the heart of war itself.

Lena stretched, cracking her knuckles. "Dawn, huh? You know, sweetheart, that doesn't give me a whole lot of time to sleep."

Riley's lips curled. "Then don't."

A slow, sharp grin spread across Lena's face. "God, I do love you."

The other wolves shifted, a murmur of anticipation rippling through them.

Because they weren't waiting anymore.

They weren't questioning.

They weren't hesitating.

This was their moment.

Riley turned toward the darkness stretching ahead of them, toward the ruins that had been waiting for her, toward the truth that had been buried for far too long.

She had spent too much time searching for answers.

Now?

She was going to take them.

The fire in her hands burned hotter, brighter, casting their path forward in gold and crimson.

"We leave at first light," she said, her voice steady.

She met each of their eyes, one by one, making sure they understood.

"This time, we aren't fighting for survival."

She exhaled slowly, the flames flickering in her grip, her power thrumming beneath her skin.

"This time we're fighting to win."

The pack didn't cheer.

They didn't celebrate.

They simply stood taller, shoulders squared, eyes gleaming in the night.

Because this wasn't the end.

This was the beginning of the real war.

And when the sun finally rose

It would rise on the ashes of those who had tried to erase her.

The wind shifted, carrying the last traces of smoke from the battlefield into the night as if the world itself knew what was coming.

Riley stood unmoving, feeling the weight of it all the past, the present, and the war waiting beyond the horizon.

No more chains.

No more stolen memories.

No more fighting a battle she didn't understand.

She understood now.

She had been born for this.

She turned, locking eyes with Kieran, with Lena, with the wolves who had bled and fought beside her, the ones who had chosen her before she had even fully chosen herself.

She saw it in them.

The trust.

The determination.

The rage.

They weren't just her pack anymore.

They were her army.

And she was going to lead them straight into the heart of history

To tear it apart and rewrite it in fire and blood.
The night was quiet now, the echoes of battle nothing more than embers smoldering in the cold air. But the silence wasn’t peaceful. It wasn’t the kind of quiet that came with victory. It was the kind of silence that came before the next storm. Riley stood at the edge of the battlefield, where the fire had begun to die down, leaving behind the blackened remains of the enemies she had burned away. The wind carried the scent of ash and earth, a whisper of the destruction she had left in her wake. But it didn’t feel like enough. It never did. Not when the war wasn’t over. Not when the true enemy was still out there, watching, waiting. She tightened her fists, feeling the warmth still lingering beneath her skin, the fire that refused to go out. For so long, she had been searching for the truth. And now, she has it. But knowing the truth and acting on it were two very different things. Kieran stepped beside her, his golden eyes still fierce, still unwavering. “You haven’t said a word since it ended.” Riley didn’t turn. Because she wasn’t sure what she would say. How could she? How could she explain what she had seen? The visions, the memories clawing at the edges of her mind, the past that refused to stay buried? For a moment, she thought about lying. Telling him she was fine. But she was tired of pretending. “It didn’t feel like the end,” she admitted, voice low. “It felt like the beginning.” Kieran studied her, silent for a moment, then nodded. “Because it is.” The truth settled between them, heavy, unspoken. And Riley hated it. Hated the way this fight kept pulling her deeper. Hated that no matter how many battles she won, there was always another war waiting. Lena’s voice cut through the night. “Well, if you two are done brooding over there, we should probably figure out where the hell we’re going next.” Riley turned, finding Lena standing over the remains of one of the creatures, nudging the ash with the toe of her boot. “If there’s one thing I’ve learned from being dragged into this mess,” Lena continued, “it’s that whenever we think we’ve won, something worse is already on the way.” She wasn’t wrong. The enemy was still out there. The ones who had erased her, rewritten history, tried to wipe her from existence. And they wouldn’t stop. Not unless Riley gave them a reason to be afraid. The pack moved through the charred remains of the battlefield, their golden eyes sharp, bodies tense. Even in victory, they didn’t let their guard down. Because this wasn’t the end. And they all knew it. The ruins were waiting for them. The past was waiting for them. And Riley was finally ready to face it. The road was long, stretching through the endless darkness of the forest, the trees looming like silent sentinels. But she wasn’t afraid. Not anymore. Not of the truth. Not of the war ahead. Because this time She was the one bringing the fire. The forest stretched before them, dark and endless, the trees standing like ancient sentinels watching their every move. But Riley didn’t feel hunted anymore. Not like before, when the past had been something she couldn’t grasp when every step forward felt like she was walking blind into a war she didn’t understand. Now? Now, she understood everything. The war wasn’t something new. It wasn’t something Tobias had started or even something Caius had been trying to finish. It had begun long before any of them. And now that she knew the truth they couldn’t stop her from burning it all down. She walked at the front of the pack, her boots pressing into damp earth, her senses razor-sharp, her breath slow and measured. Every step forward felt like stepping deeper into something bigger than herself. Not just into battle. Not just into war. But into her history. And for the first time in her life She wasn’t afraid of it. She glanced back, just for a moment. The pack was silent, steady, waiting. They had followed her into fire and blood. They had chosen her over Tobias. They had seen what she had done back there. And yet, they were still here. That should have scared her. The way they looked at her now. Not just as a leader. Not just as the girl who had survived. But as something more. As something they could believe in. It was a kind of loyalty she had never asked for. A kind of power she had never wanted. And yet She couldn’t deny that she needed it now. Because the ones who had erased her? The ones who had rewritten history? They weren’t just going to let her walk away. They weren’t going to let her exist. So she had to be ready. She had to make sure the next time they came for her they were the ones who wouldn’t survive it. Kieran walked just behind her, close enough that she could feel the weight of his presence, steady and unshaken. He hadn’t said much since the fight ended. But he didn’t have to. Because she knew. Knew he had seen what she had seen. Knew he had felt it, too the shift in the air, the change in the war. She wasn’t the same girl who had stepped into this fight. And he wasn’t the same wolf who had tried to protect her from it. They had both changed. And neither of them was turning back. The ruins were closed now. She could feel them. Not just in the earth beneath her feet, not just in the scent of stone and time lingering in the wind But inside her. Like a memory trying to surface. Like something pulling her back. The others didn’t feel it the way she did. They didn’t hear the whispers of the past curling through the trees, or the distant echo of something lost, something waiting. But Riley did. Because the ruins weren’t just another battlefield. They weren’t just another graveyard of the past. They had been hers once. And soon They would be again. As the first broken stones appeared between the trees, as the weight of something ancient, something powerful settled over the land, Riley let out a slow breath. No more running. No more hiding. No more waiting for the past to catch up with her. She was here. And this time She was going to finish what she started. The ruins rose before her, half-buried in the earth, but not forgotten. Not by her. Not by the ones who had erased her. Not by the past that refused to stay buried. The stones were ancient, cracked, and weathered by time, but the moment Riley stepped forward, she knew they still remembered her. The air shifted, thick with something unseen, something that had been waiting. She could feel it curling around her ribs, pressing against her skin not fear, not hesitation, but recognition. Like the ruins knew what she had come for. Like they had been waiting for her to return. The pack slowed behind her, golden eyes flickering in the dim moonlight. No one spoke. Because they felt it too. Not like she did not with the same deep, visceral pull that had wrapped around her the moment she set foot on this land but they felt something. Something is shifting. Something awakening. Lena let out a slow, sharp breath. “I don’t like this,” she muttered. “Too quiet. Too… expectant.” Kieran was watching Riley carefully, his stance tense, ready. “You’re sure about this?” he asked. She wasn’t. But that didn’t matter. Because she had no other choice. She stepped forward. And the ground beneath her hummed. A deep, pulsing thrum, like a heartbeat beneath the earth. The ruins were alive. Or at least something inside them was. And as Riley pressed her palm against the nearest stone, something in the air snapped. The doors to the past swung opened  A rush of heat, of memory, of something vast and ancient slammed into her chest. She staggered back, gasping, her vision flashing gold and white, the ruins around her blurring. No, not blurring. Changing. The cracks in the stones disappeared. The vines recoiled, vanishing as if time itself was unraveling. And suddenly, she wasn’t standing in ruins anymore. She was standing in the past. The city wasn’t dead. It was alive. The banners still flew, their sigils catching the wind. The torches still burned, lining the great stone walls. And the streets They were full of people. Her people. She could hear their voices, their laughter, the sound of wolves moving through the city, their eyes bright with something that had once felt like home. This wasn’t just a memory. It was a warning. Because she had lived here once. Because she had ruled here once. And because she had lost it all. The air shifted again. And then, she saw him. Standing at the edge of the city, his golden eyes darker than she had ever seen them, his body coiled, tense, like he already knew how this was going to end. Caius. Not as the enemy. Not yet. Not like the man she had been hunting through fire and blood. But as something else. As someone who had once stood beside her. As someone who had once fought for her. As someone who had once tried to save her. And just like that The vision shattered. Riley gasped, stumbling back into the present, the weight of the memory slamming into her like a blade to the ribs. The ruins were silent again. Dead again. But she wasn’t. She was alive. She was awake. And she remembered. She lifted her gaze, meeting Kieran’s eyes, steady and unshaken. “They weren’t just trying to erase me,” she said, voice quiet, fierce. “They were trying to erase all of this.” Lena let out a slow breath. “What did you see?” Riley swallowed hard. “My home,” she said. “My city.” She turned back to the ruins, her ruins. And she knew she wasn’t here to uncover the past. She was here to take it back. The past was hers. The war was hers. And now, so was the future. She exhaled, slow and steady. “We’re done searching,” she said. She turned back to the pack. “Now, we start fighting.” And this time they would be the ones rewriting history. No more waiting. No more running. No more letting someone else decide what was remembered and what was erased. This war had started centuries ago, but it would end with her. And this time, they wouldn’t take her name. They wouldn’t take her city. They wouldn’t take anything. Because Riley Hayes wasn’t just a survivor. She was the reckoning. She was the fire they thought they had extinguished. And she was going to burn everything they had built to the ground. The pack stood before her, watching, waiting. They had followed her through the shadows, through the lies, through the ghosts of a history they had never been allowed to know. But they knew it now. And they weren’t afraid. The moment she had spoken those words “Now, we start fighting” something in the air had shifted. The pack wasn’t just following her anymore. They were ready to fight beside her. To die beside her. Because this war wasn’t just hers anymore. It belonged to all of them. It had been stolen from all of them. And now? They were going to take it back. A city waiting to rise again  Riley turned to the ruins, her green eyes sharp, scanning the remnants of what had once been a kingdom. She could still feel it the echo of power, the weight of what had been lost. The city had been left to crumble, but it wasn’t dead. Not yet. Not if she had anything to say about it. She stepped forward, brushing her fingers over the stone, feeling the warmth beneath her skin, the whispers of something waiting to wake. And she knew This place was still hers. Even after all this time. Even after they had tried to bury it. It had been waiting for her to come back. And now, she has. Kieran moved beside her, silent, steady. “What do we do first?” Riley didn’t hesitate. “We make them remember,” she said. She turned back to the pack, her wolves, her soldiers. Her army. The ones who had chosen her. The ones who had fought for her. The ones who would help her burn their enemies to the ground. She lifted her chin, voice clear, unshaken. “We don’t just fight them,” she said. “We take back what’s ours.” She glanced back at the ruins, at the broken stone, at the ghosts of a kingdom that refused to stay buried. She smiled. And this time It wasn’t a promise. It was a warning. “Let’s go remind the world who we are.” A slow, powerful hush fell over the pack, the weight of Riley’s words settling deep into their bones. Because they knew what this meant. This wasn’t just another battle. This wasn’t just revenge. This was a resurrection. The ruins stood before them, silent and waiting, but they would not stay that way for long. Because Riley wasn’t just reclaiming what was lost. She was rebuilding it. And when the world saw what she was about to do They would never forget her again. The first steps of war  The wind howled through the broken stones, carrying the scent of old magic and forgotten history. Riley stepped forward, her boots pressing into the damp earth, her heart beating with something deep, something ancient. The pack followed. Kieran was just behind her, his golden eyes sharp, steady. Lena walked beside him, twirling a dagger between her fingers, her smirk gone, replaced by something colder, hungrier. Even the younger wolves, the ones who had once hesitated, stood taller now. Because Riley had given them something they had never had before. A truth that could not be erased. A leader that could not be stopped. A war that could not be avoided. They passed beneath a crumbling archway, the remains of an entrance that had once led to a kingdom. The carvings were worn, faded but as Riley’s fingers brushed The moment Riley’s fingers brushed against the worn stone, a pulse of heat rippled beneath her skin. Not fire. Not magic. Something deeper. Something alive. The carvings were almost unreadable now, eroded by time, but the second she touched them they weren’t just symbols anymore. They were words. They were names. Her name. Not the one she carried now. The one they had erased. A sharp breath left her lips as the stone reacted to her presence, the dust falling away, the letters glowing faintly in the dim light. The wolves behind her shifted, murmuring among themselves, but Riley couldn’t look away. Because she had stood here before. Not in this life. But in the one they had stolen from her. This had been her home. Her kingdom. And they had tried to bury it beneath time and silence. A slow rage curled through her chest, the fire inside her flaring hotter, sharper. Lena let out a low whistle, stepping closer. “Okay, that’s new.” Kieran didn’t say anything, but Riley could feel his gaze on her, steady, questioning. Because they all knew. They could all see it now. This wasn’t just some ancient ruin. It was a graveyard. A graveyard for a kingdom that had once ruled these lands. A graveyard for her. A throne stolen, a war forgotten  Riley exhaled slowly, dragging her fingers away from the stone, her pulse roaring. “I’ve been here before,” she admitted, voice quiet but unshaken. No one doubted her. How could they? The ruins had already spoken for her. Kieran stepped forward, his golden eyes flickering over the glowing carvings, his body coiled like he was waiting for the past to reach out and take her again. “What does it say?” he asked. Riley swallowed, staring at the letters, their meaning so clear now. “It says I was supposed to die here,” she murmured. Lena stiffened. “That’s not unsettling at all.” “But I didn’t,” Riley continued, voice growing stronger. “And that’s why they erased it.” The air thickened, the weight of her words pressing against the ruins, against the night itself. Because this was the truth they had never wanted her to find. She had been their greatest threat once. A ruler. A warrior. Someone powerful enough to change the course of history. And when they had failed to kill her They had buried her instead. But now? Now, she was unburing herself. Now, they would have to face her again. And this time She was the one who would decide how the story ended. Riley turned back to the others, fire curling between her fingers, her green eyes burning like embers in the dark. They were waiting. For orders. For a path forward. For her. She was their leader now. Not just because she had survived Tobias. Not just because she had beaten the ones who came before. But because she had shown them the truth. And the truth was more powerful than any lie history had written. “We take this place back,” she said, her voice carrying over the ruins, over the silent stone that had once belonged to her. The pack stood taller. No hesitation. No fear. Because this wasn’t just her fight anymore. This was theirs. And when the dust settled The world would remember their names. A war that could no longer be hidden  The wind howled through the ruins, carrying whispers of the past, the scent of fire and vengeance. They would come for her again. She knew that now. The ones who had rewritten history, who had controlled fate, who had erased her once before They would try again. But this time She was ready for them. Because she wasn’t a lost queen anymore. She wasn’t a ghost of the past. She was something new. Something they couldn’t erase. Something they should fear. She turned toward the rising moon, toward the path ahead, toward the war that was finally here's to win. And she smiled. “Let them try.”
The night was quiet now, the echoes of battle nothing more than embers smoldering in the cold air. But the silence wasn't peaceful. It wasn't the kind of quiet that came with victory.

It was the kind of silence that came before the next storm.

Riley stood at the edge of the battlefield, where the fire had begun to die down, leaving behind the blackened remains of the enemies she had burned away.

The wind carried the scent of ash and earth, a whisper of the destruction she had left in her wake.

But it didn't feel like enough.

It never did.

Not when the war wasn't over.

Not when the true enemy was still out there, watching, waiting.

She tightened her fists, feeling the warmth still lingering beneath her skin, the fire that refused to go out.

For so long, she had been searching for the truth.

And now, she has it.

But knowing the truth and acting on it were two very different things.

Kieran stepped beside her, his golden eyes still fierce, still unwavering. "You haven't said a word since it ended."

Riley didn't turn.

Because she wasn't sure what she would say.

How could she?

How could she explain what she had seen?

The visions, the memories clawing at the edges of her mind, the past that refused to stay buried?

For a moment, she thought about lying.

Telling him she was fine.

But she was tired of pretending.

"It didn't feel like the end," she admitted, voice low. "It felt like the beginning."

Kieran studied her, silent for a moment, then nodded. "Because it is."

The truth settled between them, heavy, unspoken.

And Riley hated it.

Hated the way this fight kept pulling her deeper.

Hated that no matter how many battles she won, there was always another war waiting.

Lena's voice cut through the night. "Well, if you two are done brooding over there, we should probably figure out where the hell we're going next."

Riley turned, finding Lena standing over the remains of one of the creatures, nudging the ash with the toe of her boot.

"If there's one thing I've learned from being dragged into this mess," Lena continued, "it's that whenever we think we've won, something worse is already on the way."

She wasn't wrong.

The enemy was still out there.

The ones who had erased her, rewritten history, tried to wipe her from existence.

And they wouldn't stop.

Not unless Riley gave them a reason to be afraid.

The pack moved through the charred remains of the battlefield, their golden eyes sharp, bodies tense. Even in victory, they didn't let their guard down.

Because this wasn't the end.

And they all knew it.

The ruins were waiting for them.

The past was waiting for them.

And Riley was finally ready to face it.

The road was long, stretching through the endless darkness of the forest, the trees looming like silent sentinels.

But she wasn't afraid.

Not anymore.

Not of the truth.

Not of the war ahead.

Because this time

She was the one bringing the fire.

The forest stretched before them, dark and endless, the trees standing like ancient sentinels watching their every move.

But Riley didn't feel hunted anymore.

Not like before, when the past had been something she couldn't grasp when every step forward felt like she was walking blind into a war she didn't understand.

Now?

Now, she understood everything.

The war wasn't something new.

It wasn't something Tobias had started or even something Caius had been trying to finish.

It had begun long before any of them.

And now that she knew the truth they couldn't stop her from burning it all down.

She walked at the front of the pack, her boots pressing into damp earth, her senses razor-sharp, her breath slow and measured.

Every step forward felt like stepping deeper into something bigger than herself.

Not just into battle.

Not just into war.

But into her history.

And for the first time in her life

She wasn't afraid of it.

She glanced back, just for a moment.

The pack was silent, steady, waiting.

They had followed her into fire and blood.

They had chosen her over Tobias.

They had seen what she had done back there.

And yet, they were still here.

That should have scared her.

The way they looked at her now.

Not just as a leader.

Not just as the girl who had survived.

But as something more.

As something they could believe in.

It was a kind of loyalty she had never asked for.

A kind of power she had never wanted.

And yet

She couldn't deny that she needed it now.

Because the ones who had erased her?

The ones who had rewritten history?

They weren't just going to let her walk away.

They weren't going to let her exist.

So she had to be ready.

She had to make sure the next time they came for her they were the ones who wouldn't survive it.

Kieran walked just behind her, close enough that she could feel the weight of his presence, steady and unshaken.

He hadn't said much since the fight ended.

But he didn't have to.

Because she knew.

Knew he had seen what she had seen.

Knew he had felt it, too the shift in the air, the change in the war.

She wasn't the same girl who had stepped into this fight.

And he wasn't the same wolf who had tried to protect her from it.

They had both changed.

And neither of them was turning back.

The ruins were closed now.

She could feel them.

Not just in the earth beneath her feet, not just in the scent of stone and time lingering in the wind

But inside her.

Like a memory trying to surface.

Like something pulling her back.

The others didn't feel it the way she did.

They didn't hear the whispers of the past curling through the trees, or the distant echo of something lost, something waiting.

But Riley did.

Because the ruins weren't just another battlefield.

They weren't just another graveyard of the past.

They had been hers once.

And soon

They would be again.

As the first broken stones appeared between the trees, as the weight of something ancient, something powerful settled over the land, Riley let out a slow breath.

No more running.

No more hiding.

No more waiting for the past to catch up with her.

She was here.

And this time

She was going to finish what she started.

The ruins rose before her, half-buried in the earth, but not forgotten.

Not by her.

Not by the ones who had erased her.

Not by the past that refused to stay buried.

The stones were ancient, cracked, and weathered by time, but the moment Riley stepped forward, she knew they still remembered her.

The air shifted, thick with something unseen, something that had been waiting.

She could feel it curling around her ribs, pressing against her skin not fear, not hesitation, but recognition.

Like the ruins knew what she had come for.

Like they had been waiting for her to return.

The pack slowed behind her, golden eyes flickering in the dim moonlight.

No one spoke.

Because they felt it too.

Not like she did not with the same deep, visceral pull that had wrapped around her the moment she set foot on this land but they felt something.

Something is shifting.

Something awakening.

Lena let out a slow, sharp breath. "I don't like this," she muttered. "Too quiet. Too expectant."

Kieran was watching Riley carefully, his stance tense, ready.

"You're sure about this?" he asked.

She wasn't.

But that didn't matter.

Because she had no other choice.

She stepped forward.

And the ground beneath her hummed.

A deep, pulsing thrum, like a heartbeat beneath the earth.

The ruins were alive.

Or at least something inside them was.

And as Riley pressed her palm against the nearest stone, something in the air snapped.

The doors to the past swung opened 

A rush of heat, of memory, of something vast and ancient slammed into her chest.

She staggered back, gasping, her vision flashing gold and white, the ruins around her blurring.

No, not blurring.

Changing.

The cracks in the stones disappeared.

The vines recoiled, vanishing as if time itself was unraveling.

And suddenly, she wasn't standing in ruins anymore.

She was standing in the past.

The city wasn't dead.

It was alive.

The banners still flew, their sigils catching the wind.

The torches still burned, lining the great stone walls.

And the streets

They were full of people.

Her people.

She could hear their voices, their laughter, the sound of wolves moving through the city, their eyes bright with something that had once felt like home.

This wasn't just a memory.

It was a warning.

Because she had lived here once.

Because she had ruled here once.

And because she had lost it all.

The air shifted again.

And then, she saw him.

Standing at the edge of the city, his golden eyes darker than she had ever seen them, his body coiled, tense, like he already knew how this was going to end.

Caius.

Not as the enemy.

Not yet.

Not like the man she had been hunting through fire and blood.

But as something else.

As someone who had once stood beside her.

As someone who had once fought for her.

As someone who had once tried to save her.

And just like that

The vision shattered.

Riley gasped, stumbling back into the present, the weight of the memory slamming into her like a blade to the ribs.

The ruins were silent again.

Dead again.

But she wasn't.

She was alive.

She was awake.

And she remembered.

She lifted her gaze, meeting Kieran's eyes, steady and unshaken.

"They weren't just trying to erase me," she said, voice quiet, fierce.

"They were trying to erase all of this."

Lena let out a slow breath. "What did you see?"

Riley swallowed hard.

"My home," she said.

"My city."

She turned back to the ruins, her ruins.

And she knew she wasn't here to uncover the past.

She was here to take it back.

The past was hers.

The war was hers.

And now, so was the future.

She exhaled, slow and steady.

"We're done searching," she said.

She turned back to the pack.

"Now, we start fighting."

And this time they would be the ones rewriting history.

No more waiting.

No more running.

No more letting someone else decide what was remembered and what was erased.

This war had started centuries ago, but it would end with her.

And this time, they wouldn't take her name.

They wouldn't take her city.

They wouldn't take anything.

Because Riley Hayes wasn't just a survivor.

She was the reckoning.

She was the fire they thought they had extinguished.

And she was going to burn everything they had built to the ground.

The pack stood before her, watching, waiting.

They had followed her through the shadows, through the lies, through the ghosts of a history they had never been allowed to know.

But they knew it now.

And they weren't afraid.

The moment she had spoken those words "Now, we start fighting" something in the air had shifted.

The pack wasn't just following her anymore.

They were ready to fight beside her.

To die beside her.

Because this war wasn't just hers anymore.

It belonged to all of them.

It had been stolen from all of them.

And now?

They were going to take it back.

A city waiting to rise again 

Riley turned to the ruins, her green eyes sharp, scanning the remnants of what had once been a kingdom.

She could still feel it the echo of power, the weight of what had been lost.

The city had been left to crumble, but it wasn't dead.

Not yet.

Not if she had anything to say about it.

She stepped forward, brushing her fingers over the stone, feeling the warmth beneath her skin, the whispers of something waiting to wake.

And she knew

This place was still hers.

Even after all this time.

Even after they had tried to bury it.

It had been waiting for her to come back.

And now, she has.

Kieran moved beside her, silent, steady. "What do we do first?"

Riley didn't hesitate.

"We make them remember," she said.

She turned back to the pack, her wolves, her soldiers.

Her army.

The ones who had chosen her.

The ones who had fought for her.

The ones who would help her burn their enemies to the ground.

She lifted her chin, voice clear, unshaken.

"We don't just fight them," she said. "We take back what's ours."

She glanced back at the ruins, at the broken stone, at the ghosts of a kingdom that refused to stay buried.

She smiled.

And this time

It wasn't a promise.

It was a warning.

"Let's go remind the world who we are."

A slow, powerful hush fell over the pack, the weight of Riley's words settling deep into their bones.

Because they knew what this meant.

This wasn't just another battle.

This wasn't just revenge.

This was a resurrection.

The ruins stood before them, silent and waiting, but they would not stay that way for long.

Because Riley wasn't just reclaiming what was lost.

She was rebuilding it.

And when the world saw what she was about to do

They would never forget her again.

The wind howled through the broken stones, carrying the scent of old magic and forgotten history.

Riley stepped forward, her boots pressing into the damp earth, her heart beating with something deep, something ancient.

The pack followed.

Kieran was just behind her, his golden eyes sharp, steady.

Lena walked beside him, twirling a dagger between her fingers, her smirk gone, replaced by something colder, hungrier.

Even the younger wolves, the ones who had once hesitated, stood taller now.

Because Riley had given them something they had never had been

A leader that could not be stopped.

A war that could not be avoided.

They passed beneath a crumbling archway, the remains of an entrance that had once led to a kingdom.

The carvings were worn, faded but as Riley's fingers brushed

The moment Riley's fingers brushed against the worn stone, a pulse of heat rippled beneath her skin.

Not fire.

Not magic.

Something deeper.

Something alive.

The carvings were almost unreadable now, eroded by time, but the second she touched them they weren't just symbols anymore.

They were words.

They were names.

Her name.

Not the one she carried now.

The one they had erased.

A sharp breath left her lips as the stone reacted to her presence, the dust falling away, the letters glowing faintly in the dim light.

The wolves behind her shifted, murmuring among themselves, but Riley couldn't look away.

Because she had stood here before.

Not in this life.

But in the one they had stolen from her.

This had been her home.

Her kingdom.

And they had tried to bury it beneath time and silence.

A slow rage curled through her chest, the fire inside her flaring hotter, sharper.

Lena let out a low whistle, stepping closer. "Okay, that's new."

Kieran didn't say anything, but Riley could feel his gaze on her, steady, questioning.

Because they all knew.

They could all see it now.

This wasn't just some ancient ruin.

It was a graveyard.

A graveyard for a kingdom that had once ruled these lands.

Riley exhaled slowly, dragging her fingers away from the stone, her pulse roaring.

"I've been here before," she admitted, voice quiet but unshaken.

No one doubted her.

How could they?

The ruins had already spoken for her.

Kieran stepped forward, his golden eyes flickering over the glowing carvings, his body coiled like he was waiting for the past to reach out and take her again.

"What does it say?" he asked.

Riley swallowed, staring at the letters, their meaning so clear now.

"It says I was supposed to die here," she murmured.

Lena stiffened. "That's not unsettling at all."

"But I didn't," Riley continued, voice growing stronger. "And that's why they erased it."

The air thickened, the weight of her words pressing against the ruins, against the night itself.

Because this was the truth they had never wanted her to find.

She had been their greatest threat once.

Someone powerful enough to change the course of history.

And when they had failed to kill her

They had buried her instead.

But now?

Now, she was unburing herself.

Now, they would have to face her again.

And this time

She was the one who would decide how the story ended.

Riley turned back to the others, fire curling between her fingers, her green eyes burning like embers in the dark.

They were waiting.

For orders.

For a path forward.

For her.

She was their leader now.

Not just because she had survived Tobias.

Not just because she had beaten the ones who came before.

But because she had shown them the truth.

And the truth was more powerful than any lie history had written.

"We take this place back," she said, her voice carrying over the ruins, over the silent stone that had once belonged to her.

The pack stood taller.

No hesitation.

No fear.

Because this wasn't just her fight anymore.

This was theirs.

And when the dust settled

The world would remember their names.

A war that could no longer be hidden 

The wind howled through the ruins, carrying whispers of the past, the scent of fire and vengeance.

They would come for her again.

She knew that now.

The ones who had rewritten history, who had controlled fate, who had erased her once before

They would try again.

But this time

She was ready for them.

Because she wasn't a lost queen anymore.

She wasn't a ghost of the past.

She was something new.

Something they couldn't erase.
###chapter 50: A Throne of Fire, A War of Shadows
The ruins were no longer silent.

They breathed.

Not in the way a living thing did, but in a way that made Riley's pulse thrum with recognition. The stones beneath her feet, the walls rising from the earth like broken ribs, they knew her.

And she knew them.

The air was thick, humming with something ancient, something waiting. The echoes of a kingdom lost, a war unfinished.

And Riley had come to finish it.

The pack stood behind her, watching, waiting not with doubt, not with hesitation, but with readiness.

Because they understood now.

This wasn't just about revenge.

It wasn't just about reclaiming what had been stolen.

This was about rewriting the world.

And they would do it in fire and blood.

She stepped forward, into the heart of the ruins, where the last remnants of her past remained.

Stone pillars loomed around her, cracked and weathered, but standing tall refusing to fall completely.

Much like herself.

Riley lifted her hand, pressing her palm against one of the ancient stones.

A shock of heat rippled through her fingers.

Not pain.

Recognition.

And then

A whisper.

Not in words.

Not in sound.

But in memory.

The ruins were trying to show her something.

Something she had forgotten.

Something they had stolen.

Her breath hitched as her vision blurred

She was there.

Not in ruins.

Not broken.

But whole.

The banners fluttered in the wind, bearing her sigil, a crest she had not yet remembered but felt deep in her bones.

The streets were alive, wolves moving between towering buildings, golden eyes bright, voices rising in laughter, in unity, in power.

This city had been hers.

Not a battlefield.

Not a graveyard.

A kingdom.

And she

She had been its ruler.

A queen.

A warrior.

A leader.

And then she had been betrayed.

The vision twisted, shadows bleeding into the golden light, war crashing through the streets like a storm.

Blood on the stone.

Fire in the sky.

And standing at the center of it

Him.

Caius.

Not as an enemy.

Not yet.

His golden eyes were wild, his blade drenched in something she could not yet remember.

And she

She had been fighting him.

Not because she wanted to.

Because she had to.

The war had been decided long before that moment.

Before she had drawn her sword.

Before she had spoken his name like a curse.

Before he had betrayed her.

And suddenly, Riley understood.

This war

It had never been about winning.

It had been about erasing her.

Erasing this place.

And now

They would all pay for what they had done

The vision shattered, and Riley stumbled back, gasping.

The ruins were ruins again.

The city was gone.

But the fire in her chest?

It was stronger than ever.

Kieran was already beside her, steadying her, his golden eyes sharp with concern.

"What did you see?" he asked.

She clenched her jaw, her fingers still trembling from the weight of the memory.

"My home," she whispered. "Before it fell."

Lena swore under her breath. "You mean before they destroyed it?"

Riley's eyes darkened. "Before they erased it."

The pack tensed.

Because they knew what this meant.

This wasn't just about reclaiming land.

It was about taking back what should have never been stolen.

And this time, they weren't leaving anything behind.

Riley exhaled slowly, letting the heat of her own power settle beneath her skin.

She turned to face them, her army, her wolves, the ones who had followed her through fire and blood.

"We don't wait for them to come to us," she said.

Her voice was steady. Final.

"We hunt them down. We make them pay. We remind them why they feared us in the first place."

Lena grinned. "Now that's a plan I can get behind."

Kieran nodded once. "Where do we start?"

Riley turned back to the ruins.

Her ruins.

Her kingdom.

"Here," she said.

Her green eyes burned.

"We start by rebuilding what they tried to destroy."

The wind howled through the ruins, stirring the ash, and carrying the echoes of a war that had never truly ended.

But Riley wasn't afraid.

She was ready.

Because they had taken everything from her once.

And now?

She was taking it back.

And the world would never forget her again.

The wind howled through the ruins, carrying the scent of stone, fire, and something deeper, something awakening.

This wasn't just a battleground anymore.

This was a beginning.

The beginning of something unstoppable.

Riley stood taller, the fire inside her no longer a whisper of power but a roar, an inferno waiting to be unleashed.

The wolves behind her weren't just a pack anymore.

They were an army.

They were the ones who would fight beside her, who would bleed beside her, who would burn the world down beside her if she asked them to.

And she would.

Because the war was here.

It had never truly ended.

And this time, she was the one who would decide how it ended.

Kieran stepped closer, his golden eyes steady, his body coiled like a wolf ready to strike.

"You really plan to rebuild this place?" he asked, his voice quieter now.

Not doubtful.

Not hesitant.

Just curious.

Riley looked at the ruins again, feeling them in her bones, in her blood.

"I don't plan to," she murmured.

"I will."

And she meant it.

This place had been stolen from her, its name stripped from history, its queen erased.

But history had made a mistake.

She was still here.

And now, she was reclaiming everything.

A kingdom meant to rise again

The wolves moved into the ruins, their eyes scanning the broken stone, the shattered archways, and the remains of what had once been a thriving city.

Somewhere beneath all the ruin, beneath the layers of dust and destruction, this place is still remembered.

It still belonged to her.

She could feel it humming beneath her feet, the whispers of the past curling around her ribs, calling her forward.

It wasn't just about revenge anymore.

It was about legacy.

Lena let out a sharp breath, planting her hands on her hips as she kicked a piece of rubble aside. "So what, we just start stacking bricks and hope for the best?"

Riley huffed a quiet laugh, but her eyes never left the ruins.

"No," she said.

Her voice was calm, certain.

"We build something they can never tear down again."

Lena smirked. "That's the kind of attitude I like."

Kieran's gaze never left Riley, his expression unreadable. "And when will they come for us?"

Not if.

When.

Because they would.

The ones who had erased her.

The ones who had rewritten history.

The ones who still believed they could control the past.

Riley turned to face them all, the wolves who had chosen her, the soldiers who would fight with her.

The pack that had become hers.

"Then we show them," she said.

A slow, wicked grin curled across her lips.

"We show them why they were afraid of me in the first place."

The night stretched long and dark over the ruins, the stars above distant and cold.

But the fire in Riley's chest burned hotter than the sky itself.

She had walked through blood and shadow.

She had been erased.

She had been buried.

And still

She had risen.

Now, she would make sure no one ever forgot her again.

Not the enemy.

Not the ones who still thought they controlled history.

Not the world itself.

Because she was not done.

She was just getting started.

The war had been waiting for her.

And now

She was ready to claim it.

The fire in her veins pulsed with every heartbeat, a slow, steady drum of something ancient, powerful, and unstoppable.

She had spent too long searching for the truth.

Too long questioning who she was, who she had been.

Now, she knew.

She was the mistake they could never correct.

The war they had tried to bury.

The ruler they had tried to erase.

And she was coming for them.

Riley turned back to the ruins, letting her fingers skim over the weathered stone, the once-great walls that had crumbled beneath time and war.

But time was just another lie.

They had tried to make her believe this place was gone, that it was lost to history like she had been.

But she could feel it.

Still beating.

Still waiting.

And she would bring it back.

Not as it was.

As something greater.

Something stronger.

Something that could never be taken from her again.

She could feel the eyes of her pack on her, waiting. Not just for orders, but for purpose.

They had followed her this far.

They had seen the fire that lived in her now, the way the past had shaped her into something more.

She wasn't just their leader anymore.

She was their queen.

Not because she had claimed a throne.

Because she had earned it.

Lena sighed, tapping a dagger against her palm, her sharp grin cutting through the tension. "Alright, sweetheart. So what's the next move? Because I'd really like to stab someone soon."

Riley let out a slow breath, her gaze never leaving the ruins.

"We rebuild," she said simply.

Lena blinked. "Like rebuild? As in, stacking rocks and playing architect?"

Riley turned to her, her green eyes sharp.

"No. As in, we make this place ours again."

Lena tilted her head, intrigued. "And then?"

Riley smiled.

"And then we prepare for war."

A slow murmur rippled through the pack.

Not fear.

Excitement.

Because this wasn't just about revenge anymore.

This was about taking back everything that had been stolen from them.

And burning down anyone who tried to stop them.

Kieran watched her carefully, his golden eyes unreadable, but Riley could see it.

The way his fists clenched.

The way his stance shifted slightly, ready.

"Are you sure?" he asked quietly.

Riley met his gaze.

No hesitation.

No doubt.

"I've never been more sure of anything in my life."

The night stretched out before them, thick with possibility, with danger, with fate.

And Riley?

She welcomed it.

She had spent too long being hunted.

Now, she was the hunter.

She turned to the pack, to the army she was building, to the wolves who had chosen her.

"We don't wait for them to come to us," she said, her voice steady, unshaken.

"We don't play defense. We don't hide in the shadows. We don't let them decide what happens next."

She exhaled, slow and deep, feeling the power of this moment, of this choice.

"We take this war to them."

Lena grinned. "Now you're talking."

Kieran nodded once, final. "Then let's get to work."

As the first light of dawn began to creep over the ruins, Riley didn't feel like a girl lost in someone else's war anymore.

She was at war.

And when the sun rose on this place again

It wouldn't rise on ruins.

It would rise on a kingdom reborn.

And the world would finally understand what it meant to fear Riley Hayes.

The first streaks of dawn bled across the sky, chasing away the last remnants of night. But the darkness had never really been the enemy.

Not for her.

She had been born in it.

Forged by it.

And now, she would use it.

The ruins around her stood still, waiting like soldiers holding their breath before the first strike.

She could feel them, the memories pressed into the very stone beneath her feet, whispering to her, calling her back to a past she had never truly left.

This place was more than broken walls and forgotten history.

It was hers.

And she would make them remember that.

The pack was already moving, their golden eyes sharp, their bodies wound tight with anticipation.

Because they weren't just here to listen anymore.

They were here to act.

To build.

To fight.

Riley watched them for a moment, taking it all in.

How far they had come.

How much they had changed.

How much she had changed.

She had once been nothing more than a girl caught in a war she didn't understand.

Now, she was the one leading it.

And she had no intention of losing.

Lena adjusted the straps on her daggers, glancing at Riley with that sharp, reckless grin of hers. "Alright, fearless leader. What's the first order of business? Are we talking about strategy? Battle plans? Raiding parties? Because I have a long list of people I'd like to stab."

Riley exhaled slowly, feeling the weight of everything settle into her bones.

There was so much to do.

So many wrongs to set right.

So many enemies to destroy.

But before they could take the war to their enemies, before they could tear down the ones who had erased her from history, they needed to reclaim something first.

Their foundation.

Their home.

Their power.

She turned, letting her gaze sweep over the ruins, the crumbling remains of something that had once stood unshakable.

And she would make it unshakable again.

"This city isn't dead," Riley said, voice steady, carrying over the morning wind.

"It was stolen from us. Just like our names. Just like our past. Just like our future."

She turned to the pack, to the ones who had followed her through the fire, through the blood, through the betrayals.

"We take it back. We make it ours again."

The wolves stilled, their eyes gleaming, their breath sharp.

Not questioning.

Not doubting.

But waiting.

Waiting for her to tell them how.

Waiting for her to lead them into the next war.

She lifted her chin.

"We don't just rebuild. We don't just hide behind these walls and hope they don't find us."

Her fingers curled into fists, flames licking at the edges of her palms.

"We dare them to find us."

Kieran's gaze darkened, his golden eyes locked onto hers. "You're making a statement."

Riley nodded.

"Let them know we're here," she said.

"Let them know we remember what they did."

She exhaled, steady, unshaken.

"And let them fear what comes next."

The ruins would stand again.

The wolves would rise again.

And when their enemies came for them

They would burn.

This was no longer about revenge.

It wasn't even about reclaiming the past.

It was about the future.

A future that no one could take from her again.

Riley lifted her hand, fire curling through her fingers, and turned toward the city.

"We start now," she said.

Lena smirked. "Now that's what I like to hear."

Kieran nodded once. "Then let's get to work."

The pack moved as one, stepping forward into the ruins, into the future they were about to carve from the ashes of the past.

And when the dust finally settled

The world would remember her.

And nothing would ever erase her again.
###chapter 51: The Kingdom of Ash and Vengeance
The first rays of dawn stretched over the ruins, bathing the shattered stone in pale gold, breathing light into a place that had only known darkness for centuries.

But Riley knew better.

The light wasn't what would bring this place back to life.

She would.

She stood at the highest point of what had once been a throne room, now nothing more than broken columns and crumbling walls, the bones of a kingdom buried beneath time.

But time had never been stronger than she was.

And time would not decide this city's fate.

She would.

Her fingers curled at her sides, fire flickering between them, a quiet, pulsing promise.

This place had been hers once.

And it would be again.

The wolves moved below, their golden eyes scanning the ruins, their bodies tense with something new.

Not fear.

No hesitation.

But purpose.

Because this wasn't just a graveyard anymore.

It was a battlefield waiting to be claimed.

And they were about to take it back.

Kieran stepped up beside her, his presence steady, familiar.

"You think we can rebuild this?" he asked, his golden eyes sweeping over the destruction below.

Riley didn't hesitate.

"We don't have a choice," she said. "This place was taken from us. We'll take it back."

Kieran nodded, accepting her answer as fact.

Because it was.

Because it had to be.

Lena, standing a few feet away, let out a sharp exhale. "Alright, I love a dramatic comeback story as much as the next person, but this is a lot of rocks and dust, sweetheart. Where do we even start?"

Riley scanned the ruins, feeling them beneath her skin as if the very stones still remembered her.

"We start where it began," she said.

She turned toward the center of the ruins, where the ground sloped downward into something deeper, something hidden.

An entrance.

Not to the throne room.

Not to the palace.

To something older.

Something they had buried along with her.

The pack followed as she descended the worn steps, their breaths slow, their movements silent.

The deeper they went, the colder it became.

Not just physically.

Something about this place felt untouched.

As if even time itself had been afraid to reach this far.

The entrance stood before them now, an archway carved into the rock, its surface covered in runes.

Not just any runes.

Wolves' marks.

Riley lifted her fingers to one, tracing the pattern.

And the moment she did

A shock of power slammed through her.

She gasped, stumbling back, the air around her thick with the weight of memory, of something trying to reach her.

"Riley!" Kieran was beside her in an instant, steadying her.

But she barely heard him.

Because suddenly, she wasn't standing in the ruins anymore.

She was standing in the past.

The chamber was lit with torches, their flames burning unnaturally bright, casting shadows along the stone walls.

She could hear the murmurs of voices, low, urgent, filled with something close to fear.

And then

A name.

Her name.

Not Riley.

Not the name she had now.

The one she had lost.

"We must do this before it's too late."

A figure moved in the dim torchlight, their cloak sweeping the stone, their hands brushing over the runes she had just touched.

"She cannot fall."

Another voice, sharper. Angrier.

"You're asking us to risk everything."

A pause.

And then

"She is everything."

The words hit her like a blade.

Because she knew, deep down, she had been here before.

She had stood in this chamber.

She had listened to these words.

And then everything went wrong.

The vision fractured, splintering apart, the torchlight dimming, the voices fading

And Riley was back in the ruins.

She staggered back, her breath coming fast, her pulse roaring in her ears.

The wolves were staring at her now, waiting.

She wiped a hand across her face, her fingers trembling.

"That wasn't just a memory," she whispered.

Kieran's jaw tightened. "Then what was it?"

Riley looked at the runes, the way the stone still hummed beneath her fingertips.

She exhaled slowly.

"It was a warning."

Lena crossed her arms. "A warning about what?"

Riley turned to face them all.

And for the first time, she said it out loud.

"They didn't just erase my past."

She swallowed hard, letting the weight of it settle over her.

"They erased something much bigger."

Silence stretched between them.

Then Kieran spoke, low, steady. "What did they bury here?"

Riley lifted her chin, her green eyes burning.

"The truth."

She turned back to the entrance, the fire in her veins burning hotter than ever.

And without another word

She stepped inside.

The pack followed, moving deeper into the forgotten chamber, their bodies tense, ready.

Because they knew.

This wasn't just about a city.

This wasn't just about revenge.

This was about something greater.

Something older.

Something that had been waiting for her return.

And this time

She wouldn't fail.

Because the war wasn't coming.

It was already here.

And she was going to win it.

The darkness swallowed them whole as they stepped into the hidden chamber, the air thick with age, with memory, with something ancient stirring beneath the surface.

The walls whispered as they moved, the runes carved into the stone glowing faintly beneath Riley's fingertips.

This place wasn't dead.

It was waiting.

Waiting for her.

Waiting for them.

And as Riley inhaled slowly, she felt it settle into her chest the weight of history, the weight of what had been taken, the weight of what she was about to reclaim.

The passage led them downward, deeper into the heart of the ruins, where the air grew colder and heavier.

The others felt it too.

Kieran's breath came slow and measured beside her, his presence steady, protective.

Lena's usual smirk had faded, replaced by something more thoughtful, more dangerous.

Even the rest of the pack, wolves who had once followed Tobias without question, stood differently now.

Because this wasn't just about following Riley anymore.

This was about belonging to something greater.

And that was what had been stolen from them all.

The tunnel widened, leading into a vast, open chamber, and the moment Riley stepped inside, she knew.

This had been the heart of the kingdom.

The true throne room.

Not the grand halls above, not the palace that had once overlooked the city.

This.

This was where it had all begun.

This was where everything had changed.

The ceiling stretched high above them, curved and carved with symbols she had never seen before but somehow understood.

Wolves.

Fire.

A sun and a moon locked in battle, their light bleeding into the sky.

And at the far end of the chamber

A throne.

Not gold.

Not silver.

Not draped in jewels and vanity like the ones in human palaces.

This throne was carved from the very bones of the earth.

Stone, dark and smooth, embedded with veins of something that glowed like embers.

It had been here for centuries.

And it had been waiting for her.

The second Riley stepped forward, the air shuddered.

Not just the air.

The stone beneath her feet.

The entire room reacted to her presence.

Lena let out a sharp breath. "Okay. I don't like this."

Kieran reached for his blade instinctively, muscles tensing. "It's not natural."

Riley barely heard them.

Because she knew what this was.

She could feel it.

This wasn't just some forgotten chamber beneath the ruins.

This was power.

The power that had once been hers.

Power that had been locked away when they had erased her.

And now

It was waking up.

She took another step forward.

The glowing veins in the stone flared, pulsing like a heartbeat.

A whisper curled through the chamber, low and distant, not from the past, but from the present.

From the wolves who had followed her here.

From the ones who were watching, waiting, holding their breath.

Because they knew what this meant.

This wasn't just a place.

This wasn't just a memory.

This was a reckoning.

A throne without a ruler.

A kingdom without its queen.

And Riley had just returned to claim it.

Kieran exhaled, slow and even, his golden eyes locked onto hers.

"This was yours, wasn't it?"

Riley didn't look away.

She didn't blink.

"Yes," she said.

No doubt.

No hesitation.

Because she knew.

She turned back to the throne, the fire in her chest burning hotter, her pulse roaring with certainty.

"They took it from me," she said.

She reached out, her fingers hovering just over the stone, the heat beneath her skin merging with the fire thrumming in the throne itself.

The energy welcomed her.

Recognized her.

And she knew

If she sat, if she took her rightful place, everything that had been lost would come back.

Everything she had been.

Everything she had forgotten.

And there would be no turning back.

Kieran shifted beside her, his voice low. "If you do this, they'll know. They'll feel it. You won't just be making a statement, you'll be making a declaration of war."

Riley smiled.

A slow, sharp, unbreakable thing.

"Good," she said.

She turned, facing the pack.

Her pack.

The ones who had followed her through fire and blood.

The ones who had chosen her.

The ones who were waiting for her to lead.

"We don't wait anymore," she said.

"We don't run. We don't let them decide how this ends."

Her voice echoed through the chamber, settling into the stone, into the bones of this place, into the hearts of those who stood beside her.

"We make them remember."

She took one last breath.

Then she turned

And sat on the throne.

The second her body met the stone, the world erupted.

The chamber shook, pulsed, and awakened.

A surge of power slammed through her veins, golden light bursting from the cracks in the stone, filling the room with fire and fury.

The past crashed into her

Not just memories.

Names.

Voices.

Everything they had stolen.

And outside, in the world beyond the ruins

They felt it.

The ones who had erased her.

The ones who had rewritten history.

The ones who had spent centuries making sure she never returned.

They felt her rise.

And they knew.

She was coming for them.

And this time

She would not fall.
###chapter 52: The Throne Remembers
The moment Riley sat on the throne, the world around her shifted.

It wasn't just power.

It was recognition.

A flood of something ancient, something waiting, surged through the stone, racing up her spine, coiling in her chest like fire trapped beneath her ribs. She gasped, her fingers gripping the armrests as the ruins around her shuddered dust falling from the carved ceiling, cracks glowing faintly beneath her feet.

The wolves around her tensed, their bodies coiled and ready, but they didn't move. They didn't speak.

Because they felt it too.

Something was happening.

Something big.

Kieran was the first to step forward, his golden eyes locked onto hers. "Riley"

She sucked in a breath, trying to steady herself, but the power wasn't stopping.

It crashed through her in waves, flooding every part of her, filling the spaces that had once felt empty.

It was like the throne in this place, this kingdom had been waiting for her return.

And now that she was here, it wasn't letting go.

Visions slammed into her, one after another

Golden banners rippling in the wind.

Wolves moved through the city streets, their eyes bright, their voices filled with something she had almost forgotten.

Belonging.

And then fire.

The vision twisted and darkened.

Flames roared through the palace halls, smoke rising into the night sky, the scent of burning stone thick in the air.

Shouts echoed in her ears.

"They're coming"

"Get her out of here"

"It's too late"

And then a hand gripping her wrist.

Pulling her through the chaos.

Caius.

Not an enemy. Not yet.

His golden eyes burned with something desperate, something raw.

"If you stay, you die."

She yanked herself free.

"Then I die standing."

The vision snapped, and Riley gasped, her chest heaving, her fingers curling into the arms of the throne. The ruins were still shaking.

The power was still rising.

Kieran's voice cut through the haze. "Riley, let go."

But she couldn't.

She wouldn't.

Because she finally understood.

This wasn't just about reclaiming the past.

This was about finishing what had started that night.

She had fought for this place once.

She had died for it.

And now

She was going to win it back.

A deep, shuddering crack ran through the stone beneath her, the glow intensifying, a pulse of energy rushing outward from the throne.

The ruins weren't just waking up.

They were calling for something.

Something out there.

Something that had been waiting for her return.

The wolves around her shifted, their golden eyes flickering in alarm.

Lena muttered, "Okay, sweetheart, I don't know what kind of ancient god crap you just activated, but you might want to stop before"

The chamber exploded with light.

The shockwave sent the pack stumbling back, the air crackling with power, fire racing along the walls, along the runes carved into the stone.

And far, far above them

Something answered.

A deep, echoing howl rippled through the night.

Not from the pack.

Not from anything alive.

It came from the ruins themselves.

From the past.

From the wolves who had once stood beside her.

And suddenly, Riley knew.

This war wasn't just hers.

She wasn't the only one who had been waiting for this moment.

The ones who had died that night, the ones who had fought until the end they had never truly left.

They were here.

They were watching.

And now, they were ready to fight again.

The power surged again, and for the first time, Riley didn't try to stop it.

She let it come.

She let it claim her.

Because this throne had been stolen.

This kingdom had been erased.

And this time she was taking everything back.

The power that had been locked away for centuries roared to life inside her, weaving through every fiber of her being, filling the empty spaces she hadn't realized were hollow. It wasn't just magic. It wasn't just memory.

It was hers.

Riley felt it surge outward, racing through the ruins, curling through the shattered stone, reaching.

Calling.

Summoning.

The air pulsed around her, alive with something ancient, something raw. It wasn't just the weight of her past pressing against her chest anymore it was the presence of those who had come before her.

The wolves who had died fighting for this place.

The warriors who had sworn their loyalty to her.

The ones who had been erased.

And yet they had never truly left.

She could feel them.

Watching.

Waiting.

A thousand whispers curled through the chamber, not loud enough to be understood, but deep enough to be felt.

She wasn't alone.

Not anymore.

The ruins trembled beneath her, the energy growing stronger, brighter, more wild. It wanted out. It wanted to rise.

And Riley knew the moment she stood from this throne, nothing would be the same again.

She wasn't just reclaiming a seat of power.

She was reclaiming an entire history.

One they had tried to erase.

One they had rewritten to fit their own story.

One that was about to burn through every lie ever told.

Kieran's voice reached her through the storm of power. "Riley!"

She barely heard him.

Because something beyond the ruins had just answered her call.

A force so vast, so old, so familiar it made her breath catch.

Far above, in the broken sky, the clouds split apart.

And then

A second howl cut through the night.

Louder.

Stronger.

Not an echo.

A response.

The pack around her stiffened.

Lena reached for her daggers, her gaze flicking toward the dark horizon. "That's new."

Kieran's stance shifted, his golden eyes sharp, scanning the ruins. "What the hell did you just do?"

Riley's fingers curled into the arms of the throne, her breath uneven, her pulse thundering.

Because she had felt it.

The recognition.

The power responds not just to her but to them.

The ones she had fought beside.

The ones she had lost.

The ones who should have never been able to answer her call.

And yet

they had.

Something ancient had awoken.

Something stronger than time.

Something the ones who had erased her never wanted to rise again.

And now

it was coming.

Riley exhaled slowly, standing from the throne, her body thrumming with fire, her green eyes gleaming in the flickering light.

She turned to her pack.

"We're not alone anymore."

The wind howled around them, the ruins groaning, the echoes of history unfurling into the night.

Because this war had never ended.

It had only been waiting for her return.

And this time

she was going to finish it.

The power curling inside her wasn't just a memory. It wasn't just something stolen, buried, and left to rot in the ruins of a kingdom she had once called home.

It was alive.

It had been waiting for her.

And now that she had returned, it would not be silenced again.

The second howl that had ripped through the sky wasn't just a call. It was an answer.

Something was coming.

Something older than this war, older than even the ones who had rewritten history.

And Riley wasn't afraid.

She turned her gaze to the sky, to the place where the darkness had split apart, where the past and present had begun to unravel. The weight pressing against her ribs wasn't just the memories flooding back, it was something bigger.

A force that had been waiting for the right moment.

For her.

Kieran's voice was sharp with warning. "We need to move."

Lena stepped beside him, blades drawn, her smirk gone. "What the hell did you wake up, sweetheart?"

Riley didn't blink.

Didn't flinch.

Because she could feel it now.

The presence moving in the distance.

The power rippled across the ruins.

She had called something back from the ashes.

Something the world thought was long dead.

She stepped down from the throne, the energy following her, curling around her like a fire that could not be tamed.

Her pack tensed, waiting.

But she wasn't waiting anymore.

This wasn't the part of the story where she stood still and let fate decide what came next.

This was the part where she took control.

Riley met Kieran's gaze, steady, certain.

"We're not running."

Kieran's jaw clenched. "You don't even know what's coming."

She did.

She knew exactly what was coming.

The echoes of the past had been stirring beneath her skin since she first stepped foot in these ruins.

She had heard their whispers.

Felt their anger.

And now they are here.

The wolves who had died fighting for this kingdom.

The ones who had been erased along with her name.

Their spirits had never left.

They had been waiting, just like she had.

Waiting for her to wake them up.

Lena's grip tightened around her daggers. "I don't know about you, but I'd like to know if we're dealing with ghosts, gods, or something worse."

Riley smiled.

Slow. Sharp. Unbreakable.

"If they're ghosts," she said, stepping forward, "then they're on our side."

The wind howled through the ruins, kicking up dust, and rattling through the broken stone.

The second howl rang out again closer this time.

And this time, it wasn't alone.

A chorus of howls followed, rippling through the night, stretching across the land like a battle cry.

Kieran's fingers twitched toward his blade, his golden eyes flashing with something dangerous.

"Tell me I'm not hearing what I think I'm hearing," he murmured.

Riley's heart pounded, but she didn't look away from the darkness beyond the ruins.

"You are," she whispered.

Because she had felt them the moment she touched the throne.

The fallen wolves.

The forgotten warriors.

The army that had been lost to time.

But now, they are waking up.

And she knew, with a certainty that burned in her very bones

She wasn't just leading the living anymore.

She was leading the dead.

And when the war finally began

She would not be fighting alone.

The ground beneath her feet trembled, a slow, deep pulse that wasn't just the ruins shifting it was something else.

Something is rising.

The howls echoed again, weaving through the night air like a battle cry carried by voices that should no longer exist.

But they did.

Because they had never truly left.

Kieran took a step closer to her, his voice quieter now, edged with something he rarely let show uncertainty.

"Riley"

She turned her head, just enough to meet his gaze, and for the first time since this war had begun, she felt no doubt.

"They're with us," she said, her voice steady, unwavering.

The howls answered.

Louder.

Fiercer.

The past was no longer just a memory.

It was here.

And when she led this war when she burned their enemies to the ground

They would rise with her.
###chapter 53: When the Dead Howl
The air was thick with something ancient, something impossible. It wasn't just the ruins that had awoken it was the past itself, shaking off centuries of dust, rising to meet her call.

Riley stood motionless, every muscle in her body coiled tight as the howls carried through the night. They weren't just sounds. They were memories, warnings, and declarations of war.

The wolves behind her felt it too. Their golden eyes flickered with something close to unease, their bodies tense, their instincts screaming at them to move, run, fight.

But Riley didn't move.

She didn't run.

She stood at the center of it all, fire curling beneath her skin, welcoming it.

Kieran shifted beside her, his hands curled into fists, his breathing sharp and controlled, but his voice was quiet. "Tell me you know what's happening."

She didn't answer. Not yet.

Because she was listening.

The howls weren't wild or directionless. They were coming from somewhere.

And then she felt it.

A shift in the air.

A presence pressing against her ribs, curling through her lungs, recognizing her.

The past knew her name.

And now, it was answering.

Lena exhaled sharply, adjusting the grip on her daggers. "I hate to be the one to say it, but should we be concerned? Or, I don't know, running?"

Riley took a slow step forward, toward the sound, toward the pull thrumming beneath her skin. "No one's running."

The ruins around them groaned, the stones shifting beneath their feet as if something beneath them was stirring.

A low growl rippled through the pack. Not from fear, not from hesitation from readiness.

Because if something was coming, they weren't going to wait for it.

They would meet it head-on.

Kieran's voice was steady but edged with warning. "Riley, talk to me."

She exhaled, her hands curling at her sides, flames flickering at her fingertips.

"They were never gone," she murmured. "They were waiting."

A heavy silence fell between them, broken only by the wind cutting through the ruins.

Kieran's gaze sharpened. "Who?"

Riley's heart pounded as she turned to face them all, the fire in her veins rising with something new.

Something she hadn't just accepted something she had claimed.

"The ones who died fighting for this place." Her voice was steady, unshaken. "The ones who were erased

The earth shuddered.

Not a quake.

Something breaking free.

A deep, bone-rattling sound echoed beneath them as if the ruins themselves were exhaling.

And then

From the shadows, from the distant cliffs beyond the ruins, figures began to appear.

They moved slowly, at first. Shadows stretching, twisting in the moonlight.

Then they stepped into view.

Not ghosts.

Not quite.

They were wolves.

Massive, hulking beasts with eyes that burned like embers, fur streaked with something darker than shadow. Not alive, but not dead.

Something in-between.

Something time had failed to erase.

The pack stiffened, the younger wolves shifting uneasily, but no one moved.

No one dared.

Because the dead had returned.

And they were staring directly at Riley.

A slow, measured breath filled her lungs.

She should have been afraid.

But she wasn't.

Because deep down, she knew

They had come for her.

The largest of them stepped forward, its golden eyes flickering in the dim light, unwavering, unblinking.

It wasn't just looking at her.

It was waiting.

Riley lifted her chin, feeling the weight of every choice that had led her here, every battle, every betrayal, every moment she had spent clawing her way back to the truth.

She had called them.

And now, they wanted to know why.

The massive wolf let out a deep, guttural sound, not a snarl, not a threat.

A question.

What now?

Riley didn't hesitate.

She stepped forward, unshaken, meeting its burning gaze with one of her own.

And she answered.

"We finish what they started."

The air shifted like the very world itself had just exhaled.

And in that moment the dead wolves bowed.

A ripple of stillness spread through the pack, an unspoken energy crackling in the air like the moment before a lightning strike. No one spoke. No one breathed. The living wolves stood frozen, their golden eyes wide with disbelief, but Riley didn't hesitate.

Because she understood.

The dead did not bow for just anyone.

They did not acknowledge the unworthy.

This wasn't a submission.

This was recognition.

A vow renewed.

A kingdom rising from the ashes of time itself.

The fire beneath her skin surged, responding to the weight of it all, to the moment itself because this was it. This was the shift, the point of no return, the thing that had been building inside her since the day she first learned she was never supposed to exist.

They had erased her.

They had rewritten history.

They had buried her name, her kingdom, and her people, thinking that would be enough to silence her forever.

But nothing buried in the past stayed there.

Not forever.

And now

Now, they would pay for what they had done.

The largest of the wolves lifted its head, golden eyes burning, waiting for her next move. The others remained still, their hulking bodies poised, their presence stronger than a shadow, more solid than memory. They weren't ghosts.

They were the warriors who had been waiting.

For her.

At this moment.

For their second war.

A slow breath curled through Riley's lips, measured and deliberate, but her pulse thundered in her ears. She felt the past pressing down on her, the weight of a thousand voices that had been stolen.

And now, they had given her back their loyalty.

She stepped forward, locking eyes with the wolf in front of her.

The moment her boots touched the stone before them, the ruins responded.

A deep, shuddering tremor rippled beneath her feet. Dust rained from the broken ceiling, the faint glow of the ancient carvings pulsing stronger, brighter.

Lena exhaled sharply, her fingers twitching toward her daggers. "So, just checking are we all seeing the same nightmare fuel, or am I the only one who needs a drink right now?"

Kieran's voice was quiet, intense. "They're real."

Lena let out a slow, sharp laugh. "Fantastic. Ghost wolves are real. The apocalypse is officially here."

Riley barely heard them.

Because she knew what came next.

This was not just a moment of reunion.

It was a moment of convergence.

The past was not just waking up.

It was merging with the present.

Her people had not been erased.

They had been waiting for her return.

Riley lifted a hand, fire curling at her fingertips, not in threat, but in command.

The massive wolf held her gaze for a heartbeat longer then it bowed lower, pressing its massive head to the stone.

And one by one, the rest of them followed.

The army of the forgotten.

The Warriors lost to time.

The wolves who had died defending her throne.

A shiver ran through the living pack, as if they, too, could feel it.

Lena let out a slow breath. "Sweetheart, if you're not planning to say something really dramatic right now, I'm going to be very disappointed."

Riley's lips curled into a slow, fierce smile.

She turned to face her pack both the living and the dead.

And then, she spoke.

"They erased us."

The words carried through the ruins, sharp as a blade, fierce as fire.

"They buried our names. They rewrote history to make sure we were forgotten. They thought if they erased me, they erased all of us."

Her fire burned hotter, illuminating the cracks in the stone, and making the glowing carvings shine brighter.

"They were wrong."

The wind howled through the ruins and the echoes of her words carried into the night.

She took another step forward, her gaze sweeping over the army that had risen at her call.

"They will come for us. They will try to silence us again. But this time"

Her fire flared higher, casting golden light across the wolves, across the ruins, across everything that had once been hers.

"This time, we won't fall."

A deep growl rumbled from the ghostly wolves, a sound so low and powerful it vibrated in her chest.

Riley's green eyes burned.

"We take back everything they stole. We burn down their world. And when they beg for mercy"

She lifted her chin.

"We remind them why they should have feared us in the first place."

And then

the dead wolves howled.

Not just one.

Not just a few.

All of them.

The sound split through the ruins, shaking the air itself, rising into the sky like a war cry that had been centuries in the making.

The living wolves followed.

One after another, their voices joining the dead, merging, becoming one.

The world had tried to erase them.

Now, it will be remembered.

Because this wasn't just the moment Riley reclaimed her throne.

It was the moment she declared war.

And the world would feel it.

The echoes of their howls stretched far beyond the ruins, ripping through the night like a warning, like a promise, like the sound of something unstoppable rising from the ashes.

Somewhere, in the distant shadows, their enemies were listening.

Somewhere, the ones who had erased her, the ones who had rewritten history, the ones who had tried to bury this kingdom beneath time itself

They felt it.

And for the first time in centuries

They were afraid.

Because this was not just a power shift.

It was not just a single girl reclaiming what had been stolen.

It was a reckoning.

The air itself seemed to pulse with the weight of what had been set in motion, the howls of the living and the dead entwining into something more than sound, something felt deep in the bones of the world.

Far beyond the ruins, beyond the forests and the cities built on stolen land, beyond the reach of those who had once held the strings of fate in their hands, they knew.

The past had not died.

The queen they had erased was not only alive

She was rising.

And she was bringing hell with her.

Riley let the fire in her veins burn brighter, let the howls carry her name into the night.

Because this time

She would not stop until everything they built was nothing but ash.

Not until their towers crumbled.

Not until their lies were burned away.

Not until every name they had stolen, every truth they had buried, was dragged back into the light where it belonged.

She could feel it now, the fear curling through the night like smoke, reaching those who had thought themselves untouchable. The ones who had controlled history, who had shaped the world to fit their will.

They had spent centuries erasing her.

Now, she was coming to erase them.

Riley lifted her chin, her green eyes fierce and unrelenting as the fire between her fingers crackled, hungry, waiting.

She had once been a forgotten name, a stolen memory, a girl lost in a war she hadn't understood.

But now

Now, she was at war.

And when she came for them when she shattered the world they had built, when she burned through their power with a vengeance written in fire and blood

They would know exactly what they had unleashed.
###chapter 54: The Fire That Would Not Die
The howls still echoed, stretching into the night, reverberating through the ruins, through the broken stones and the shattered past. They did not fade. They did not waver. They rose higher, deeper, vibrating in the very bones of the earth.

Riley stood at the center of it all, her breath slow, her pulse steady, as the fire in her veins matched the rhythm of something ancient waking inside her.

She had expected fear.

She had expected uncertainty.

But what filled her now was certainty, fire-forged and unbreakable.

The wolves both the living and the dead, waited.

Golden eyes locked onto her, unwavering, full of something she had never had before.

Loyalty.

Not the kind that was forced.

Not the kind built from fear or blind devotion.

This was something earned.

The ghosts of the past had not bowed for centuries, yet they had bowed for her.

The pack that had once followed Tobias without question had not hesitated to follow her instead.

And now, she has an army.

Not just of wolves.

Of warriors.

Of those who had been erased, forgotten, cast aside by those who had rewritten the world.

But no more.

This war was theirs now.

Lena let out a sharp breath, shifting on her feet as she took in the massive ghostly wolves surrounding them. "So, just to make sure I'm not hallucinating, are we fighting alongside actual dead wolves now?"

Riley's lips curled, slow and knowing. "Yes."

Lena grinned. "God, I love this war."

Kieran, however, was still watching Riley. Not in shock. Not in doubt.

In understanding.

Because he had felt it too.

Something had shifted.

And there was no turning back.

His voice was calm, steady. "We need to move. You know they felt that."

Riley nodded. She did.

Far beyond these ruins, they were listening.

The ones who had buried her.

The ones who had erased this kingdom.

The ones who still thought they could stop what was coming.

They were wrong.

The wind stirred, carrying embers from her fingertips, the fire curling around her like an extension of herself. She wasn't just standing in the ruins anymore.

She was rebuilding them.

One step at a time.

One battle at a time.

And she would not stop until every last one of them burned.

She turned to the wolves, her wolves.

"We march at dawn," she said.

And the howls answered her.

It was not just a sound. It was a promise. A declaration.

The night itself seemed to pulse in response, the wind carrying their voices far beyond the ruins, spreading across the land like a ripple in a still lake. But this was not stillness. This was war waking up.

Riley felt it in her bones, in the way the ground seemed more solid beneath her feet, no longer just a forgotten battlefield but hers again.

The pack didn't hesitate. They stood taller, their golden eyes alight with something sharp and unyielding. They had spent their lives fighting someone else's war.

Now, they would fight for her.

Lena sheathed her daggers with a sharp grin. "Dawn, huh? Not even giving them time to sleep off the fear?"

Riley smirked, her fire burning brighter. "No."

Lena chuckled, shaking her head. "You're my favorite person in this war."

Kieran, however, was still watching her, unreadable, golden eyes flickering like he saw something no one else did.

Not just a leader.

Not just a warrior.

Something more.

"We're not just marching," he said quietly.

Riley met his gaze, understanding.

"No," she agreed.

They weren't just moving forward.

They were taking back what had been stolen.

One step at a time.

One city at a time.

Until nothing remained of the ones who had tried to erase them.

She lifted her chin, turning to the ruins one last time.

This place had remembered her.

And soon

The world would, too.

But not just her name.

Not just the whispers of a past they had tried to bury.

They would remember the fire.

They would remember what it meant to fear her.

The ones who had rewritten history, who had shaped the world to their liking, who had decided which stories lived and which were forgotten

Their time was ending.

Because Riley was not just here to reclaim what was stolen.

She was here to tear down everything they had built.

She turned to face her wolves, her army, her people, the ones who had chosen her before she had even chosen herself. The golden light of the ghostly warriors shimmered in the night, standing alongside the living, a force that should not exist.

And yet, they did.

Because time had not killed them.

Because history had failed to erase them.

Because they had never truly left.

Their loyalty was not bound by life or death. It was bound to her.

Kieran stepped closer, his golden eyes never leaving hers. He didn't say a word, but she knew.

He saw it now, too.

This war was not just for the present.

It was a war to reclaim the past.

A war to shape the future.

Lena exhaled, tilting her head at Riley. "You know, I've followed a lot of bad ideas before, but this one? This is the first time I believe we can win."

Riley smirked, the fire in her veins thrumming. "That's because we already have."

Lena grinned. "I really do love you."

The pack shifted, waiting, ready.

There was no more hesitation.

No more doubt.

They would walk into battle with her.

They would set the world on fire if she asked them to.

Because she wasn't just their leader anymore.

She was their vengeance.

And when dawn came their enemies realized what had awakened in these ruins

It would already be too late.

Too late to stop her.

Too late to silence the ghosts that had risen.

Too late to change the course of history they had spent centuries rewriting.

Because this time, the story was no longer theirs to control.

Riley had taken it back.

And she would burn the old world to the ground before she let them steal it again.

The ruins seemed to breathe with her, the energy thrumming beneath her skin no longer foreign, no longer unfamiliar. It was hers, as it had always been. As it had been meant to be.

She turned her gaze toward the horizon, where the sky was still cloaked in night, but the faintest sliver of light had begun to rise.

Dawn was coming.

And with it, war.

Kieran stood beside her, his stance steady, his golden eyes dark with understanding. "They'll know we're coming."

Riley didn't blink. "Good."

Lena smirked, twirling a dagger between her fingers. "If they're smart, they'll run."

"They won't," Riley said, her voice sharp as steel, her fire flaring brighter between her fingertips. "They've spent too long believing they've already won. That they've already erased us."

She lifted her chin, the weight of this moment settling deep into her bones, solid and unshakable.

"Let them think they're safe."

The wind howled through the ruins, stirring the dust, the embers, the echoes of a kingdom that refused to stay buried.

Because they weren't just reclaiming a throne.

They were bringing an empire back from the dead.

The wolves both the living and the ones lost to time, stood in perfect silence, waiting for her command.

She took a slow step forward, standing at the edge of everything that had been stolen from her, her voice carrying through the night like the first note of a song that had been centuries in the making.

"We march at dawn."

A final, thunderous howl split the sky.

And the world at last began to remember.

Not in whispers.

Not in the twisted, rewritten stories their enemies had crafted.

But on fire.

In the echoes of the past clawing its way back into existence.

In the way the very earth trembled beneath their feet, no longer a graveyard of forgotten names, but a battlefield waiting for war.

The howl that split the sky was not just a sound.

It was a reckoning.

A signal that the forgotten ones had risen.

That the queen they had erased was coming.

And this time, she would not fall.

Riley stood at the head of it all, unshaken, unafraid, unstoppable.

She had walked through the fire of their lies.

She had bled for their betrayals.

She had been hunted, broken, and buried beneath history itself.

And yet, she was still here.

More than that

She was ready.

The past no longer haunted her.

It belonged to her.

And the future?

That would be written in their ashes.

The wolves behind her moved as one, waiting, watching, golden eyes burning with the same unrelenting hunger that pulsed beneath her skin.

For centuries, their kind had followed orders from those who had stolen the truth.

For centuries, they had bowed to a power that was not real.

That ended now.

Because she was the power.

She was the fire, the storm, the unbroken force that would tear through everything that stood in her way.

Dawn was approaching.

And when the sun rose

It would rise on a world that finally remembered her name.

Not just as a whisper in the dark.

Not just as a ghost of a queen long forgotten.

But as a force that could not be stopped.

As the fire that could not be extinguished.

As the reckoning that had come for those who thought themselves gods.

The air around her pulsed, thick with energy, with the weight of something far greater than this single moment.

Because this was not just a battle.

It was not just vengeance.

It was the return of everything they had stolen.

Riley lifted her chin, the fire beneath her skin thrumming louder, hotter, as the wolves behind her both the living and the dead stood in perfect, waiting for silence.

She could feel it the moment before the storm.

The breath before the strike.

The instant before the world split apart.

They had spent their lives following orders given by those who had chained them to a lie.

But now?

Now, they followed her.

Not because they had been forced to.

Not because they had no choice.

But because she was the truth they had been denied.

And when the world saw her coming

It would bow.

Or it would burn.

The choice had never been theirs to make.

Not when they had rewritten history with blood-stained hands.

Not when they had stolen her throne, buried her name, and chained the wolves to a false king.

They had spent centuries believing they had won.

That their version of the past was the only one that mattered.

That the fire had been extinguished forever.

They were wrong.

Because Riley was no longer just a girl fighting to survive.

She was the war they never saw coming.

The wind howled around her, carrying the scent of fire and ruin, the echoes of the past folding into the present, stretching toward the future she would carve from their ashes.

Behind her, the pack waited, silent and still, their golden eyes locked onto her, unwavering. They had been soldiers in someone else's war for too long.

But now?

Now, they were hers.

And when she moved, they would move with her.

She exhaled slowly, the embers in her hands flickering brighter, stronger.

They would not stop.

Not until every chain had been broken.

Not until every name that had been erased was spoken again.

Not until the ones who had stolen everything from them had been torn apart.

The first rays of dawn began to crest over the ruins, the golden light stretching across the broken stone, over the wolves who stood waiting, over the throne she had reclaimed.

Riley turned toward the horizon, toward the path ahead, toward the war that had already begun.

And as the fire in her veins roared to life, she whispered the last promise she would ever make to her enemies

"Run."
###chapter 55: The Last Dawn Before War
The first light of dawn painted the ruins in gold and crimson, stretching long shadows across the cracked stone. The world felt different now, heavier like the air itself was holding its breath, waiting for what came next.

Riley stood at the edge of it all, her fire still burning low at her fingertips, her pulse steady despite the weight pressing down on her. The wolves behind her both the living and the dead, were silent, their golden eyes locked onto her, waiting for the command that would change everything.

She had spent so long chasing the past, searching for answers, trying to understand why she had been erased. Now, she no longer needed to ask.

She knew.

And knowing meant there was only one thing left to do.

Take it all back.

Kieran stepped beside her, his stance steady, his golden gaze unreadable. But she could feel the shift in him, the way he stood closer now, not as someone waiting for orders, but as someone who had already chosen his side.

"You're sure about this?" he asked quietly.

Riley turned her gaze toward the distant horizon, where the city of their enemies lay in the path of the rising sun.

"They erased me," she said. "I'm just returning the favor."

Lena let out a sharp breath behind her, flipping a dagger between her fingers. "God, I love it when you talk like that."

A slow, fierce smile curled at the edges of Riley's lips, but the fire in her eyes didn't waver.

"We will move soon," she said, her voice carrying over the ruins.

The pack straightened, their bodies tensing in quiet, sharp readiness.

There was no hesitation.

No doubt.

They had been waiting for this.

Waiting for the day when they would no longer have to answer to the ones who had rewritten history.

Waiting for the moment when they could finally become the war that had been stolen from them.

Riley turned, facing them all, feeling the weight of their trust settle against her ribs. She had never asked for this. Had never imagined herself leading an army of wolves both living and dead.

But fate had made its choice.

And now, so had she.

"We don't stop until the city falls," she said.

Lena grinned, sharp and wild. "And when they beg for mercy?"

Riley's fire flared brighter, the embers crackling between her fingers, her voice steady as stone.

"We remind them that we were never the ones who needed it."

The dead wolves lifted their heads, their glowing golden eyes locked on hers, their massive bodies still as if waiting for something unseen.

And then

They howled.

Low, deep, resonant, a sound that shook the very ruins beneath their feet.

The living wolves followed, their voices rising into the air, merging with the howls of those long gone, creating a chorus that stretched across the land.

A declaration..

The war had been waiting for too long.

Now, it has finally begun.

The sound of their howls carried through the morning air like a storm breaking the silence before destruction. It was not just a battle cry, it was a reckoning.

Somewhere, far beyond the ruins, their enemies would hear it. They would wake from their false sense of security, feeling a chill crawl down their spines, sensing something shifting in the world.

But by the time they truly understood what was coming, it would already be too late.

Riley could feel it, the slow, inevitable pull of fate drawing her forward. The past no longer felt like something distant, something unreachable. It was right here, woven into her, burning beneath her skin like a promise she intended to keep.

Kieran was still beside her, his golden eyes sharp, watching, waiting. He had always been a fighter, always been willing to stand on the front lines. But this was something else.

This wasn't just another battle.

It was the war to end everything.

The war to erase the ones who had erased her.

The war to rewrite history in her fire.

Riley took a step forward, feeling the power humming beneath her feet, in the stone, in the wind, in the wolves who had placed their faith in her.

"We move at first light," she said.

No one questioned her.

Because they all understood what this moment meant.

There would be no turning back.

No retreat.

Only victory.

And when the sun finally rose high enough to touch the ruins

It would not rise on the forgotten.

It would rise on the ones who would never be erased again.

The fire inside Riley pulsed in response to those words as if the ruins themselves agreed. As if the very earth beneath her feet had been waiting for this moment for her.

She had been erased once.

She had been buried beneath history, forced to live in the shadows of a life stolen from her.

But now?

Now, she was the storm that would bring everything back.

The sky above them stretched into a pale gold, the first hints of morning breaking against the horizon. The dawn of a new day. A new war.

The pack remained still, their bodies poised, their golden eyes filled with something unchangeable.

They weren't just wolves anymore.

They were an army.

And Riley was their war.

Kieran's voice cut through the quiet, steady, low. "When this starts, there's no stopping it."

Riley didn't blink. "Then we don't stop."

His golden eyes held hers for a long moment, searching for something hesitation, doubt, uncertainty.

But there was none.

Because she had already made her choice.

Lena let out a sharp exhale, spinning a dagger between her fingers. "God, I've never been this ready to ruin someone's entire existence."

The other wolves shifted, their tension fading into something else anticipation.

Because they weren't afraid anymore.

They weren't uncertain.

They weren't waiting for someone else to lead them to a future they had been denied.

They had already chosen their queen.

And when they moved, when they struck when their enemies saw what had come for them

They would finally understand that history does not forget forever.

Riley let her fire burn brighter, casting flickering gold against the ruins.

"We are done waiting," she said, her voice carrying through the stillness, unshaken. "We take back what was stolen. We destroy the ones who tried to erase us. And we do not stop"

She turned toward the city on the horizon, where their enemies slept, still believing themselves untouchable.

"until they know what it means to fear us."

The dead wolves howled once more, their voices weaving into the wind, into the land, into history itself.

And this time

The world would remember.

Not in whispers.

Not in the fearful hush of a forgotten legend.

But on fire.

In the echoes of their howls carrying through the land, reaching the ones who had buried them beneath lies.

On the way, the earth trembled beneath their feet, no longer a graveyard but a kingdom waiting to rise again.

The pack stood unwavering, their golden eyes alight with the same hunger, the same certainty that pulsed beneath Riley's skin.

This was not just about revenge.

This was about reclaiming everything.

They had been broken.

They had been erased.

But they were still here.

And now, they would tear down the ones who had dared to believe they were gone.

Kieran stepped beside Riley, his golden gaze locked onto the city in the distance, the place where their enemies still sat in their stolen power, unaware that the past was clawing its way back to the surface.

His voice was quiet, steady. "They won't see it coming."

Riley let the fire in her veins surge, bright and undeniable.

"That's the point," she murmured.

The wind shifted, carrying the scent of war, of change, of something inevitable.

No more waiting.

No more hiding.

No more letting others decide the fate of those who had already lost everything.

The ones who had stolen their history, who had shaped the world in their image, who had spent centuries believing they had won

They were about to learn the truth.

Riley turned toward her wolves, toward her army, toward the warriors who had placed their trust in her.

"We take back our home."

The ground pulsed beneath them, the ruins humming in response.

The past was alive again.

And as the first rays of the sun finally broke over the horizon

So was she.

Not as the girl they had tried to erase.

Not as the forgotten queen buried beneath time.

But as something new.

Something they could never silence again.

The fire beneath her skin pulsed in time with the rising sun, golden embers flickering against the ruins, dancing through the air like echoes of the past that refused to be buried any longer.

This was no longer just a reclamation.

It was a resurrection.

The wolves around her both the living and the dead, felt it too. They stood taller, their bodies thrumming with the same unshakable force that surged through her veins. This wasn't just their war anymore.

It was their destiny.

The wind howled through the ruins, weaving between the crumbling stones like a final warning to those who had built their thrones on stolen power. The past was no longer sleeping.

It was awake.

Kieran shifted beside her, his golden eyes locked onto hers, searching for something with some last trace of hesitation. But there was none.

She had made her choice.

Now, she would make them all remember why they should have feared her in the first place.

Riley let out a slow breath, feeling the weight of centuries settles against her ribs, no longer a burden but a weapon.

Her voice was quiet, but it carried through the ruins, steady and unshaken.

"Let's end this."

And as the wolves began to move, their shadows stretching toward the war ahead

The world finally felt the return of a queen who had never truly left.

And this time, I will not be able to forget her.

Riley took the first step forward, and the pack moved with her, their footsteps silent but heavy with purpose. The ruins no longer felt like remnants of a lost kingdom; they felt like a battlefield waiting to be claimed.

The wind carried the scent of fire, of dawn, of war.

She could taste it on her tongue, feel it thrumming through her bones.

It was time.

No more playing by their rules.

The world belonged to those who dared to take it, and Riley had never been more certain of what was hers.

Kieran walked at her side, his golden eyes dark with understanding, his body coiled and ready, like a wolf standing at the edge of the hunt. He didn't speak, didn't need to because he already knew.

Lena smirked, flipping a dagger in her hand. "If we're doing this, let's make it hurt."

The dead wolves followed in eerie silence, their glowing eyes locked on Riley, waiting for her to lead them into the storm.

She would.

And she would not stop until every last one of them burned.

The world had tried to bury her.

Now, she would bury them.

As the first light of morning stretched across the land, Riley took another step forward

And with her, an army rose.

The living and the dead, shadows of the past and warriors of the present, all moving as one. The weight of history pressed against them, but it did not hold them down, it pushed them forward.

The earth beneath them seemed to pulse with energy, with fire, with something old and unshakable. The ruins no longer felt like a place of loss. They felt like a starting point.

A rebirth.

Riley didn't look back. There was nothing left behind her, nothing worth remembering except the mistakes of those who had tried to bury her.

Their reign had ended the moment she remembered who she was.

The moment she took back her name.

Ahead of them, the path to war stretched wide and open. The city where their enemies sat in comfort, still believing they were safe, still believing that time had done its job, still believing they had already won.

They were wrong.

Riley's fire flickered brighter, hotter, hungry.

Because this was not just about reclaiming what had been stolen.

It was about making sure it could never be stolen again.

She lifted her chin, her voice steady and sharp as a blade.

"We move now."

And as she stepped forward, leading them toward the first battle of the war

The world itself seemed to exhale as if it knew that the past had finally caught up.

This time, there would be no mercy.

Only fire.
