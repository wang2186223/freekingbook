###chapter 1: Echoes of the Past 
**************
Sacrificing her youth to save a stranger’s wedding, Sarah Cornell endured three years of icy marriage—betrayed, framed for infidelity, and robbed of her unborn child by the family she married into. Shattered, she vanished.

Two years later, she resurfaces as "Blaze Belle", a legend on the racetrack, and a genius software designer. When her path collides with her ex-husband Philip—now a media mogul—their battle ignites in boardrooms and on speedways. But as old wounds bleed and a deadly secret threatens Sarah’s heart, one question remains: Can vengeance heal the scars of a sapphire betrayal?

— A tale of shattered vows, resurrection, and the poison of love that refuses to die.
**************
"Did you ever, even once, imagine yourself loving me?" Sarah inquired, her voice laced with hope as she gazed into Philip's unyielding countenance. 
"Don't make me laugh, Sarah. Everything between us has been purely about pleasure and business."  
With a heavy heart, she affixed her signature to the divorce papers, clinging to a glimmer of hope that one day, she would find a man who would adore and worship her worthiness.

**Sarah**  

On a quiet night at Serenity Pines Estate, where I've made my home for three years, the door's 'click' announced my husband's arrival-Philip Cornell, who's competing for the presidency of Luminary Productions, an entertainment company. 
Rising from the sofa, my customary perch, where I often waited for his return, I glanced at the wall clock; its hands whispered the lateness of the hour-already one in the morning. 
The heavy wooden door swung open, revealing Philip's unsteady form. A waft of alcohol preceded him, mingling with the stillness of the night. His arm draped over the shoulder of his assistant, Alexander Davies. 
"What happened to him?" was the question I managed to ask Alex. 
"Madam, I'm truly sorry. Something happened. Boss Philip had drunk too much," he replied. He refrained from offering further details, as was often the case, despite my desire to express concerns about the increasing frequency of Philip's drunken returns in recent days. 
"Please help me! Let's take him to the room." 
Alex and I worked in tandem, helping Philip to the bedroom. With his considerably heavier body in contrast to my own, which was significantly smaller, I felt as though my bones might shatter and bruises would surely mark my skin. 
Both Alex and I were panting heavily as we carefully laid his boss down on the bed. 
"Th-thank you!" 
With a simple smile, the assistant made his way toward the door, poised to leave Serenity Pines Estate. It was a rare moment of conversation between us, akin to those I share with my husband, Philip. 
I gingerly removed Philip's shoes and socks, my cheeks flushing with embarrassment. Next came his polo, a task I could only accomplish in his unconscious state. 
How long had I harbored these forbidden fantasies about him? My husband, so physically near yet emotionally distant, bound by the unspoken rule that we mustn't intrude upon each other's lives. 
As I finally succeeded in stripping off his polo, he vomited violently, the acrid stench filling the air. My stomach churned in sympathy, threatening to betray me as well. With sheer willpower, I fought back the urge to vomit as my tears of frustration pooling in my eyes. 
We do not employ household help, primarily because of my personal preference. However, maids from the Cornell household visit three times a week to assist with cleaning at Serenity Pines Estate. 
I cleaned up the sour and nauseating mess he had expelled from his mouth beside the bed. 
Three years ago, my mother-in-law asserted that our duty as women was to serve our husbands. I hoped that by fulfilling this duty, Philip would notice or perhaps view me as a woman who loves him deeply. 
As I gathered cleaning supplies to tackle the mess, tears welled in my eyes, swept up by the overwhelming weight of the situation I found myself in. 
How much longer must I endure this? How much longer will I tolerate waiting for the overflowing love I've poured into my husband to be reciprocated?  
Yet, amidst this turmoil, there's Philip, whom I cherish deeply. I've already relinquished so much for him, will his mere sickly discharge be the breaking point for my resolve?  
After meticulously scrubbing every inch of the floor and banishing any lingering odors from the room, I proceeded to the wardrobe in search of his pyjamas. 
Within a cabinet, I noticed an unfamiliar, expensive-looking box. Curiosity piqued, I lifted the lid, revealing a stunning necklace adorned with a captivating blue sapphire encircled by delicate diamonds. 
Tomorrow marks our third wedding anniversary, a fact that fills me with palpable excitement. Could this be Philip's surprise for me?  
Our relationship is somewhat low-key. It's quiet mostly because I try not to complicate things for Philip as his wife. Moreover, despite the knowledge of a select few individuals about our relationship, I remain virtually unknown to the public in his life. 
As I returned to bed, I found solace in gazing upon his innocent face, a privilege I only enjoy on nights such as these before drifting into slumber. 
I awoke after several hours to the sensation of someone tenderly kissing my neck and gently squeezing my chest, igniting warmth that surged through every vein of my body. 
Philip's tender affection never fails to stir excitement and happiness within me. Each touch is a symphony of pleasure, a delightful melody that resonates deep within. Yet, beyond our intimate moments, deciphering his thoughts is like navigating through a labyrinth in the dark. 
The haunting memories of the previous night inundated my thoughts, their weight pressing heavily upon me. Yet, amidst this tumultuous sea of recollection, overshadowed by his sweet worship of me. 
*** 
"Sarah!" my mother-in-law's voice echoed through the kitchen as I busied myself with cleaning. Philip had left early, and he was no longer beside me when I woke up. 
"Mrs. Cornell?" I sighed inwardly, accustomed to her impromptu visits to Serenity Pines Estate, always ensuring I adequately tended to her son's needs. She often invited friends along, as Philip's father maintained strict control over visitors to the Cornell mansion. 
Mr. Cornell is a commanding figure both at home and in his marriage, while Mrs. Cornell prefers to keep the nature of their relationship discreet. Therefore, she consistently disrupts my peace whenever she extends invitations to her friends, encroaching upon the sanctity of my own home. 
Surrounded by five other ladies at the round table, they were deeply engrossed in gossiping and playing cards, and despite this being my home, shared with Philip, the weight of unspoken thoughts pressed upon my mind, shackling my voice in silent submission. 
"Hello, ladies!" I greeted them with forced cheerfulness, though part of me longed to request they not visit, as their presence only added to my workload and noise levels. 
"Hello, Sarah!" one of the ladies responded, while the others seemed to ignore my existence entirely. 
"Why are you just standing there? Hurry up and prepare tea and snacks for us!" Mrs. Cornell's reprimand cut through the air. 
As a dutiful daughter-in-law, I quickly went to the kitchen to fulfill her requests. Once the preparations were complete, I rejoined the group of ladies, placing tea cups, cookies, and wrapped biscuits on the table before returning to attend to some household chores. However, as I busied myself, I couldn't help but overhear their conversation. 
"Oh, did you hear? Megan's back," Mrs. Wilson mentioned casually. 
My grip faltered, and a delicate vase slipped from my fingers, shattering on the floor. 
"What on earth, Sarah? Are you intent on destroying every precious belonging of my son in this house?! My goodness! Do you even realize that the vase was imported from Japan? I highly doubt you could even afford to replace it!" Mrs. Cornell scolded, her voice laced with anger. 
"I-I'm terribly sorry! I'll clean it up right away," I stammered. 
I could sense her seething rage as if she wanted to slap me or yank my hair, but she held back, mindful of her guests' presence. 
'Megan... Megan...' The name reverberated in my mind as I carefully tidied up the shattered remnants of the vase. The sharp sting of a glass shard pierced my finger, causing a jolt of pain to shoot through me. Despite the tiny bead of blood, I brushed aside the discomfort, too engrossed in my thoughts to pay it much attention. 
Anxiety gnawed at me. Megan is Philip's ex-fiancée. 
I couldn't shake off the unsettling thought of Philip's recent drunken escapades. Could Megan's sudden reappearance be the cause?
###chapter 2: The Unseen Cost 
**Sarah**   
To calm down, I avoid dwelling too much on what I just heard-about Megan's return.   
After I attempted to refocus on the housework, a couple of hours later, Mrs. Thompson's daughter passed by, accompanied by three children who dashed across the tiled floor, leaving traces of dirt on the couch. After a brief snack, they all departed.  
A glance at the clock revealed it was already two o'clock. The ladies concluded their game, leaving behind a trail of orange peels, biscuit wrappers, and used cups-a mess they appeared unbothered by leaving behind.  
Exiting Serenity Pines Estate one by one, my mother-in-law turned to me, leaving a reminder, "Oh, by the way, Philip asked me to remind you about tonight's dinner at the Heritage Harvest Hotel. Don't forget!" With that final message, she turned away and approached the waiting black Mercedes-Benz S-Class, where a driver stood by.  
A spark of excitement ignited within me. Today marks my anniversary with Philip, and I couldn't shake the thought that a surprise celebration might await us at the hotel.  
As the car drove away, I smiled and waved, observing the gradual departure of people from the driveway. Then, I spotted two trucks loaded with equipment not far off. Someone was moving into the villa adjacent to ours. Although I didn't linger on the sight, I mentally noted it before heading indoors.  
The blast of hot air escaped my lips as I confronted the mess awaiting my attention. There was no avoiding it; I had to tidy up before heading to the Heritage Harvest Hotel, as Philip was adamant about maintaining order.  
***  
My pace quickened as I approached the hotel restaurant, my heart pounding with nervous anticipation. Thirty minutes behind schedule, I had rushed to ensure Philip wouldn't discover the stain left on the couch by a kid guest.  
"Excuse me, where is the hotel restaurant?" I inquired of a passing staff member, a sense of urgency coloring my tone.  
"Just turn right there, ma'am!" she promptly directed.  
Following her instructions, I barely stepped into the hallway before spotting Philip and Megan outside the restaurant. Instinctively, I retreated behind a nearby wall, concealing myself from their view.  
Their conversation seemed intense, Philip's demeanor stoic as he presented the box I had glimpsed the night before. A mix of surprise and delight adorned Megan's features as she accepted the necklace from Philip's hands, allowing him to clasp it around her neck.  
A surge of panic seized me, my hand instinctively lurching towards my chest, fingers coiling tightly around my pounding heart. Waves of tremors convulsed through my body as the stark truth pierced my consciousness like a dagger in the dark.  
The necklace wasn't meant for me.  
Nor was this gathering.  
It was all for Megan's return.  
Unseen tears cascaded down my cheeks, silent witnesses to the crushing weight of understanding that engulfed me. With a heavy, defeated exhale, I turned away, feeling like I had lost a gamble of the heart.  
'Sarah, what more could you possibly be hoping for? You've known all along that Philip and Megan are meant to be together.'  
My chest constricted painfully, making it difficult to draw in a breath. Sarah's presence loomed large, casting a shadow over our marriage.  
My acquaintance with Philip began when I was just eighteen. I was introduced to him through his half-sister Jane, who was my college classmate and closest friend. Jane, the product of Mr. Cornell's extramarital affairs, had tragically lost her mother at a young age.  
Jane and I attended Crestwood University together, frequently utilizing their mansion as a study spot and, admittedly, sneaking glances at Philip whenever I could.  
The crushing blow came when I was nineteen, learning that Philip was set to marry Megan. However, fate intervened cruelly on their wedding day when Megan eloped with another man abroad, leaving Philip at the altar.  
"This is your fault! Your actions led to Megan leaving today! What are we going to do now? It's embarrassing to have investors and Luminary Productions supporters waiting outside!" Mr. Cornell's voice echoed down the hallway as he reprimanded Philip.  
"We need to find a replacement bride immediately! I can't face my business partners empty-handed! Take action!" his father demanded once more.  
After a brief moment of hesitation, I knocked on the door gently despite it being slightly open. Gathering my courage, I boldly decided to offer myself to Philip as his bride.  
His attraction to me was intense during my youthful naivety. I was so enamored with Philip that I would sacrifice my youth for him. Becoming his wife felt like a fair trade-off, a substitute for Megan in his life.  
For an excruciating three years, I clung to the hope that Philip would finally reciprocate the boundless love swelling within me, growing more fervent with each passing day! Does he know the sacrifices I've endured throughout these three years of marriage?  
Yet, amidst my role as a wife, I didn't give up on my studies completely. I secretly took online classes, which Crestwood University kindly offered to me. I focused on Advanced Programming, keeping it a secret because I didn't want any trouble from Mrs. Cornell. She believed I should only concentrate on taking care of Philip. That's also why I decided not to hire a maid.  
Lost in thought, the wind's chill seeping into my skin as I walked along the road.  
My phone rang, snapping me out of my thoughts. I thought it might be Philip asking where I was, but it was Jane calling. She is currently in London for training, while I remain in Highland Hills City to fulfill my role as Philip's wife. Without Jane, I lack someone to confide in about my struggles.  
I hurriedly wiped away my tears before answering with a forced, cheerful tone.  
"Bestie!"   
"Happy wedding anniversary!" she cheerfully greeted me over the phone.  
"Thank you," I managed, but tears welled up once more.  
I am writhing in pain. My best friend remembered my anniversary with her brother, yet Philip seemed oblivious to my absence at the restaurant. I fought back tears, questioning if he even noticed.  
"I miss you so much!" Jane's enthusiasm on the other end intensified the ache in my chest.  
"I-I miss you too! I wish you were here so I could hug you tightly," I said, my voice trembling with suppressed sadness.  
"Aw How are you?" Jane's concern offered solace.  
How am I, really? I am not okay!   
But I don't want to burden my friend abroad. I need to overcome this challenge on my own, without worrying her about my marital struggles, even if she is Philip's sister.  
"I'm fine," I replied to Jane.  
"I'll go home after the exam! We'll see each other soon! I have to go! I'm feeling sleepy. Enjoy your night with Philip!" Jane bid me goodbye.  
Tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision as I ended the call. My cheeks were drenched with the weight of profound sadness. With a trembling hand, I composed myself, fighting back the overwhelming tide of tears threatening to engulf me. The ominous sky above seemed to echo my turmoil, threatening to release its torrent of tears. I knew I had to get home, bracing myself against the impending storm both outside and within.  
Just as I wiped my damp cheeks, a van stopped before me, its door sliding open. I couldn't react fast enough as two men swiftly grabbed me by both arms.  
"Ahhh!" I desperately looked around at passing vehicles, hoping for help.   
Another man pressed a wet cloth against my mouth. A potent smell invaded my nostrils, and my strength waned instantly. Slowly, my vision dimmed, and I lost all ability to move.  
Confused and disoriented, I found myself in the bed I shared with Philip beside a stranger whose face was unfamiliar.  
"Ahhh!" I screamed involuntarily and recoiled. Fear and self-assessment coursed through my veins.  
My eyes widened in shock as the door violently swung open, revealing Philip, still clad in the three-piece suit from the hotel where I had witnessed him presenting Megan with the necklace.  
"What the fvck is going on?!" His voice thundered, intensifying the dizziness already clouding my mind.   
With swift determination, he seized the man by his collar and unleashed a forceful punch. I screamed in terror as the man hastily recoiled as if suddenly exposed in the act of cheating.  
I could feel Philip's hands clenched with the desire to hurt me, but he restrained himself, his gaze darkening with suspicion.  
"Philip, please, you have to believe me! I was kidnapped! I don't know what's going on!" I pleaded desperately.  
My mother-in-law suddenly appeared, her presence adding to the chaos. "I knew it! I've been telling you, Philip! That's why I've been coming to Serenity Pines Estate, to keep an eye on that wench! I knew she was up to something!"  
"N-no, that's not true!" I interjected, my voice trembling with defiance.  
With a sneer, Mrs. Cornell pulled out some photos from her bag and tossed them onto the bed.  
I spotted myself in the photos, seated across from Jakob, my classmate from Advanced Programming, engaged in conversation. He was his usual self, sporting his trademark hoodie jacket, while I wore a radiant smile in those snapshots. In another image, I embraced him beside his motorcycle, yet this time, his hoodie boasted a different hue.  
Suddenly, a startling realization dawned on me as I recalled that the man I had been with was also clad in a hoodie!  
"You're meeting your lover in different restaurants! And now, you've even brought them to your own room?" Mrs. Cornell accused, her tone sharp and accusatory.  
No, no! With a vehement shake of my head, I battled against the torrent of baseless accusations crashing upon me like waves against a rocky shore. Desperately, I fought against the suffocating weight of unjust suspicion that threatened to consume me.
###chapter 3: A Son's Burden 
**Philip**  

"I handed you the job! We poured millions into this movie, only to discover the audience isn't pleased with the story's flow. And now there's negative feedback because the lead actress is embroiled in scandals!" My father's voice echoed in his expansive office. 
"Do something!" he bellowed, hurling papers at me that had been neatly arranged on his broad desk moments before. 
Clenching my fist, I exited his office. Crisis after crisis plagued Luminary Productions, and yet, as CEO, my father dumped it all on me. 
This was the norm in the office between me and my father. Despite orchestrating the issues himself, he still pointed the finger at me, the designated heir apparent as president of production. According to him, it was my responsibility to foresee these challenges! But when would he finally confer the position upon me? I had been his protégé for two years now, and there seemed no end in sight. 
I practically lived at work, bending over backwards to cater to his every whim! But I doubted I'd ever receive the love I yearned for from Dad. 
His treatment was like a heavy weight crushing my spirit! Yes, I'll admit to making errors in judgment and overlooking matters in the office, but I've paid my dues. I deserve the position that rightfully belongs to me! 
With a heavy heart, I channeled all his anger into my work.  
But hours later, my father barged into my office again, immediately blaming me for the current ranking of a popular movie produced by a rival company.  
"You failed to secure that celebrity from them! Had he been with Luminary, we wouldn't have been overshadowed by StellarScape!" he exclaimed, gesturing towards our competitor before hurling the iPad containing the news in my direction. 
I couldn't even count how many times an iPad had been replaced due to his outbursts. Unfortunately, I was today's target. I remained silent, but my furrowed brows betrayed the weight of his accusations. Alex stood quietly on the side, avoiding eye contact with my father. 
After the CEO stormed out, frustration boiled within me.  
"Investigate the ranking!" I ordered sharply, my tone cutting through the tension. 
"Understood," Alex responded dutifully before reminding me, "Boss, we have a dinner meeting." 
I didn't respond immediately, taking a moment to compose myself before reluctantly heading to the gathering. 
At the event, I commanded unwavering respect from partners and acquaintances alike, a testament to my unwavering stature. Despite the relentless storm of mistreatment from my father, I stood tall, unwavering in my resolve. I am not just Philip Cornell; I am the indomitable heir to the illustrious Luminary Group.  
I'm unable to resist the allure of alcohol once more, succumbing to its temptation after enduring several days of feeling low. The stress weighed heavily on me, driving me to repeatedly reach for the whiskey until I lost all sense of control. 
As I stirred from the haze of the night before, I was met with the sight of Sarah beside me. Her very presence casts a calming spell over the chaos of my mind. In her embrace, I found refuge from the storm raging within me. Her eyes, a mesmerizing shade of gray, glimmered with an innocence that washed away my troubles.  
In a world fraught with turmoil and strife, it was in her arms that I discovered true solace. She bore the weight of my burdens without complaint. She never demanded more of my time or the things I could offer.  
Bare of inhibition, I removed our garments, consumed by the intoxicating ecstasy of the night, and surrendered to each other in a passionate s3x.  
The following morning, in a routine now familiar, I awoke with the weight of my troubles pressing upon my mind. Despite the throbbing ache of a hangover, duty called at the office.  
As I stood beneath the frigid downpour of the shower, allowing the icy droplets to wash away the turmoil within, my phone lit up with a notification. It was a message from my mom, waiting for me to read it. 
Mom: Megan has returned. Son, we must extend our support to her. Her time abroad hasn't been kind. Despite everything, she's still a friend. She confided in me that her lover mistreated her, even neglecting to provide for her basic needs. If possible, please consider buying a gift or something that could make her feel better. 
I briefly glanced at the message before returning to my preparations for the office. Megan has always been close to my family. We've been friends since university, but our relationship took a casual turn. However, when she entertained the idea of eloping with another man, I wasn't hurt; rather, I was annoyed because it bruised my pride. 
One of our investors, who holds the company in high regard, inquired about my marital status when I was twenty-seven. He cited examples of their children, who married between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. They believed I needed a partner to accompany me to various social gatherings and to uphold the image of a responsible and respectable man. This reasoning, endorsed even by my father, was why I eventually agreed to marriage. 
Back then, my thinking was straightforward: it didn't seem like there would be any problems if I married someone. 
Like a programmed machine, I dutifully adhered to my parents' wishes, convinced that I would wield power effortlessly once I ascended to the presidency. 
But today, as I marked my third wedding anniversary with Sarah, memories flooded back. I retrieved the necklace box and casually added it to my belongings. 
A tidal wave of desire crashed over me, seeing Sarah sprawl on the bed, tempting every nerve in my body to reach out to her, yielding to the irresistible allure of her presence, just as I prepared to leave. Yet, like chains of obligation, the weight of impending office matters held me back. 
Later that evening, I unexpectedly encountered Megan at the restaurant. Her face lit up, contrasting with my puzzled expression as I pondered her presence there. 
"I thought this was supposed to be dinner with Dad and Sarah?" I asked Mom, my expression carrying the usual nonchalance. 
"Ah, Megan is still family! She struggled for three years in another country. Have some compassion!" Mom scolded. 
"Philip, I-I'm sorry... It just so happened that I bumped into Auntie outside," Megan replied, though I suspected it was a lie. 
Nevertheless, I just shrugged. Time flew by as they conversed while I diligently attended to my emails on my mobile phone. Their chatter annoyed me because I had office matters, and some required immediate responses. I didn't want to face Dad's anger again. 
I stood up when Mom asked me, "Where are you going?" 
"I need to call Alex." Glancing at the clock, I realized Sarah still hadn't arrived. I understood that if Dad couldn't make it to dinner, it was his habit not to attend these gatherings. "Ma, can you call Sarah? She's late!" Irritation laced my voice. 
"What is she even doing? My goodness! She's not even contributing to expenses!" 
I allowed my mother to contact Sarah, as another pressing issue was demanding my attention at the office. Stepping away, I phoned Alex, who is currently representing me in a meeting. The multitude of issues is pounding against my skull like a relentless storm, threatening to shatter the fragile peace within. 
After the call, Megan approached me. With her presence near me, I couldn't help but notice the changes-her hair was now shorter and radiating glamour after her triumphant return to her family. 
"Philip..." Her voice quivered, and she couldn't meet my gaze. 
"What's wrong?" I inquired. 
"I-I just want to apologize," she said with tears in her eyes as if burdened with all the troubles. 
I recalled what my mother had mentioned about Megan's mistreatment by her lover, resulting in her return to Highland Hills City.  
"It's alright," I reassured her. Though my pride had been wounded at the time, that was three years ago, and truthfully, I had moved beyond it. The accusations by my father against me at the office now sting even more. 
"Um, Auntie mentioned you got me a gift?" she asked tentatively. 
My eyebrow shot up in astonishment. The memory of my mother's mention of purchasing a gift for Megan flickered in my mind, though it had been shrouded in the chaos of my thoughts. 
"I-I'm sorry!" she said tearfully. "I shouldn't have expected anything." 
Her tears flowed. I felt irritated, but I couldn't bring myself to scold her. Somehow, Megan and I had become friends. 
A sigh escaped my lips, and I hugged her. "It's fine," I muttered. 
I delicately retrieved the exquisite box, cradling the necklace meant for Sarah. Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to gift it to Megan instead. After all, Sarah was nowhere in sight, and I decided I could purchase another one for her later. 
I secured it around Megan's neck before proceeding to the restaurant together. 
It wasn't until we decided to leave that I realized how much time had passed. 
"Oh, I left something at Serenity Pines Estate earlier," my mom said, so I decided to join her ride and let my driver do his routine. 
Torrential rain pounded down relentlessly as we navigated our way home. My mind raced with concern, wondering where Sarah could be. 
The dirty rubber shoes by the front door weren't familiar. I was confused about who owned them, especially since they were significantly larger than my wife's size. 
Did Sarah invite a worker to the house? 
"I knew it! That Sarah has another man!" Mom exclaimed, souring my expression. 
Sarah's scream from the bedroom pierced the air, shattering the silence of our home. However, the true shock set in when I entered the room to find Sarah accompanied by an unfamiliar man.  
Instantly, anger surged through me, igniting a desire to hurt them!
###chapter 4: Unveiled Betrayal 
**Sarah**  

Philip's grasp on my arms was ferocious, each finger a vice, as if he were a stranger lost in the depths of his own darkness. It was as though he couldn't recognize me anymore. Under the weight of his anger, my bones felt fragile, on the brink of breaking, and I couldn't fathom what thoughts raced through his mind-a familiar uncertainty that haunted our interactions. 
With each step down the broad staircase, his chest heaved with fury.  
"Philip, please, calm down! I-I didn't do anything!" I pleaded, tears streaming down my cheeks, matching the torrential rain outside that also mirrored his rage. 
As he escorted me out of Serenity Pines Estate, the cold enveloped me, matching the chill in his demeanor. Every drop of rain felt like it seeped into my very being, amplifying my distress. I struggled to comprehend what was happening, still reeling from whatever substance the abductors had forced upon me. My eyes felt as clouded as my mind. 
"No, Philip!" I begged desperately, clinging to the hope that he would listen and believe me. I was innocent, framed, but his accusatory tone cut through the storm like a knife. 
"Stay there!" he commanded, shoving me out of the gate. 
"No, Philip! You have to believe me!" I cried out, pleading with him, but his belief in my infidelity drowned out my words amidst the raging storm. 
"Philip, please trust me!" I pleaded through tears, the pain radiating through me. I knew, deep down, that the figure in the hoodie hadn't laid a hand on me. 
In that heart-stopping moment, faces blurred into insignificance as the gate sealed my fate with a resounding crash.  
On my knees, the cold asphalt biting my skin, I gazed up at the imposing Serenity Pines Estate, with tears cascading down my cheeks, tearing through my soul. My body trembled uncontrollably, ravaged by a chill that seemed to emanate from the very depths of my despair. 
I mustered the strength to rise, pounding on the imposing gate and begging Philip to let me in.  
"Philip!" I cried out, but my pleas fell on deaf ears. 
As my hands grew numb with pain, I sank to the ground, hugging my knees tightly, lost in a whirlwind of despair. I couldn't leave; this was my only refuge. I hoped Philip would relent and open the gate once more. 
Time blurred as I remained curled up, rain soaking me through, chilling me to the bone. Then, through a hazy-streaked vision, I saw a black limousine pull up. Before I could grasp the figure's identity emerging from the vehicle, darkness descended upon me like a suffocating shroud, the frigid embrace of the wet cement enveloping me in a chilling embrace.  
With each passing hour, my eyelids hesitantly parted, revealing a world of searing heat and the relentless throbbing of my body, accompanied by the rhythmic beep of the nearby machine.  
Although shielded from the frigid embrace of the rain, an inexplicable shiver persisted, coursing through my veins like an icy river. The sterile whiteness enveloped my surroundings starkly contrasted with the numbing chill that gripped me from within. 
"So cold" I murmured, my voice trembling. 
I was embraced by a thick blanket, causing my eyelids to flutter shut as I felt its warm tendrils envelop me, drifting me back into the realm of dreams because I could hear Amir-my older brother. 
"What happened to you, Sarah?" Amir's voice echoed in my dream, sadness etched across his features. "I came to Highland Hills City for a business trip, never expecting to find you like this. Your chosen family seemed fine; you studied and lived in a grand villa." 
"I'm fine," I replied, masking the truth. "I love Philip deeply, and we've had no issues in our years together. Your investigation is accurate."  
I'm unwilling to burden Amir or anyone else, especially Philip. 
But tears threatened to spill, betraying the turmoil within me. I yearned to grow weary of pouring my time, effort, and boundless affection into loving someone, but how could I when my love for Philip was so consuming, compelling me to do anything for him? 
Amir's figure gradually faded, replaced by Philip's blurred visage, lingering in my hazy vision. 
*** 
**Philip** 

Rage courses through my veins like wildfire, ignited by the scene I've just witnessed. I long to have faith in Sarah and believe in our bond's sanctity, but doubts gnaw at my mind relentlessly. 
Outside, Sarah's fists pounding against the heavy aluminum gate echoed in harmony with the relentless downpour. A part of me yearned to rush to her side, but the thought of appearing foolish held me back. 
My relationship with Sarah has always been casual, but now I wonder if that was a mistake. Has she grown tired of our marriage, seeking solace in the arms of another man? For the second time, she has shattered my pride and the fragile trust that once resided in my heart. 
'She wouldn't betray me, would she?'  
Beside me, my mother's words cut like knives. "That woman has no shame! What does she think of our family? We took her in when she was nothing, and now she repays us like this? Disgusting! I won't allow her to poison our family any longer!" 
Her disdain for Sarah is nothing new to me; it's been evident for three years. 
"Where did you find those pictures, Mom?" I inquired, trying to keep my voice steady despite the storm brewing within me. 
"I had them investigated thoroughly! There was a day when I dropped by, and I didn't find Sarah at home. Why would she be out when we have groceries delivered right to our door every week? And that person in the hoodie who always seems to be meeting her outside? I made sure to look into that as well. Trust me, there's more to their relationship than meets the eye!" 
A wave of darkness crashed over my senses as the vivid memory assaulted me once more-that sight of that person and Sarah in the room! 
My wife, Sarah, lost her parents at a young age. I became acquainted with her about a year ago when she frequented the Cornell mansion for her studies; she attended school with my half-sister, Jane. During my less hectic days at Luminary, I used to chat with both Sarah and Jane. 
Jane informed me that Sarah relies on a scholarship since she is an orphan. Despite this, Jane generously shared her Netflix account and other subscriptions to assist Sarah with her studies. My wife wasn't just a brilliant student; she's a prodigy, surpassing expectations in several classes. What truly captivated me was her relentless dedication to everything she pursued. 
Then came my wedding day; Megan left, and Sarah offered herself as my bride to save my face from scrutiny. 
"Why did you offer yourself to be my wife?" I inquired of her then. 
It took her a while to gather her thoughts before responding. "I-I need money. I need assurance that I'll be able to live," was her reply. 
Sarah's admission left a bitter taste in my mouth. I couldn't shake the feeling that she had become opportunistic, seizing the chance to join the Cornell family. My sentiments towards her swiftly soured because I've always harbored a disdain for those who exploit situations for personal gain, perhaps because it mirrors the traits I've observed in my parents. 
My mother's lineage can be traced back to Maple Grove, a quaint sanctuary in the northeastern countryside, where families earn a modest living through agricultural labor. She embodied the image of a rural girl who boldly seized the chance to marry a prosperous businessman-my father! Her fervent pursuit of wealth and authority is unmistakable, and her actions frequently vex me as much as my father's. 
Jane is the one who truly brings out the best in me. Though we come from different mothers, our bond as siblings is profound. We've always found solace and affection in each other, so I feel compelled to shield her from my mother's grip. 
My thoughts are abruptly interrupted, snapping me back to attention. "Are you listening, Philip?!" My mother's words pierced through my thoughts. "What right does that stupid wench have to try and infiltrate the Cornell Family? Megan is a far better match! Their family has wealth!" 
"Her name is Sarah, not 'stupid wench!" I retorted, feeling frustration simmering within me.  
I am utterly drained, pushed to the brink by a relentless onslaught of challenges. Battling through the treacherous waters of office politics, wrestling with the suffocating grip of my overbearing mother, and now, the searing betrayal of Sarah's infidelity weighs heavily upon me. 
"She's just another gold-digger bitch aiming to become your wife!" 
I released a frustrated sigh. "Mom, I'd appreciate it if you could leave," I finally muster the strength to request. 
"What?" she shouted at me, her voice cutting through the tension like a blade. "And what do you want? Let your unfaithful wife in here? I told you, Philip!" 
"Stop it!" I shrieked in frustration, my patience wearing thin. It felt wrong to raise my voice at my mother, but I couldn't bear to listen any longer. 
"Roque!" I called out, locking eyes with my mother, who was visibly seething. Roque, her trusted driver and bodyguard, promptly entered the villa. 
"Yes, boss?" he responded, awaiting my command. 
"Please escort Madam Cornell to the mansion," I ordered firmly, determined to resolve the situation. 
With a sharp clench of her jaw, my mother begrudgingly trailed behind Roque as they exited the living room. As she stormed out, leaving behind a cloud of tension, I anxiously scanned the surroundings for Sarah, but she was nowhere to be seen.  
Desperate, I reached for my phone, dialing Alex frenetically to uncover my wife's whereabouts.  
After what felt like an eternity of agonizing suspense and a seemingly endless twenty minutes dragged by like hours, I finally received a response. 
"Boss, your newest neighbor, Amir Benner, took Madam Sarah to the hospital."
###chapter 5: Feverish Frustration 
**Philip**  

Finding myself enveloped in darkness, I was at a loss upon hearing the news of Sarah's hospitalization, especially alongside the last person I would have expected.  
My knowledge of Amir Benner stems from my engagement within the racing community; he presently holds the position of president at TerraTraxx Automotive, situated in Dubai. 
"As per my investigation," Alex began, "Mr. Benner arrived in Highland Hills for business purposes. He's also collaborated with Luminary Productions to promote their latest car model." 
I barely registered his words. I don't give a f\[u\]ck about Mr. Benner's affairs. What consumed me was understanding his connection to my wife. 
Seeming to sense my agitation, Alex added, "Boss, Mr. Benner just arrived recently. I doubt he's acquainted with Madam Sarah." 
No matter how desperately I craved solace, his words were mere whispers against the tempest raging within me. Just moments ago, I had discovered Sarah in the company of another man. Gripped by anger, I'm lost in a whirlwind of emotions, unable to discern what I feel now that she's with a different man. 
The relentless downpour had softened to a mere drizzle as the car pulled up in front of the hospital. Exiting the car with Alex at my heels, determination fueled my strides as we made our way through the hospital corridors, intensifying the urgency to reach the ward where my wife awaited me. 
"Madam Sarah is in that room, Boss," Alex pointed out, indicating the direction. 
With an air of icy resolve, I flung the door open, revealing the sight of Amir perched on the bed, clutching my wife's hand. A storm brewed within me as I unleashed a voice that echoed with thunderous fury. 
"What the hell are you doing with my wife?!" I bellowed. 
Amir's gaze shifted towards me, his eyes narrowing in my direction as he lifted his face.  
"Wife?" He arched an eyebrow before straightening up. "If she truly is your wife, why did you leave her outside your villa? Your wife is sick with the flu, yet you callously left her there until she passed out?" 
Every fiber of my being urged me to strike him for his intrusion, but I knew I had to maintain composure, especially considering my father's warnings about getting into trouble. Amir was here for business with Luminary Production at Highland Hills. I needed to keep my cool. But I wouldn't allow him to meddle in my affairs. 
"I never imagined the president of TerraTraxx Automotive would stick his nose into my personal affairs. This is strictly between me and my wife! So, Mr. Benner, what exactly is your relationship with her?"  
His fist clenched tightly, the tension crackling in the air as he paused, carefully considering his next words. A smirk played across my lips as I anticipated his response. Without missing a beat, I confidently called out, "Alex!" 
"Boss?" My assistant strode in from the hallway, his expression clouded with confusion. 
"Get my wife out of this hospital!" I demanded sharply. Sarah couldn't stay here, and I had no intention of explaining why to anyone. 
"You've got to be kidding me!" Amir's voice bristled with anger. "Your wife is barely recovering from the flu!" 
The way he dared to speak of Sarah like that ignited a raging inferno within me. My fists clenched so tightly I could feel the bones grinding against each other as I fought to contain the emotions threatening to erupt from within. 
"That's none of your concern! Where I take my wife is my decision alone. She's my wife!" I snapped back, my tone cutting. 
"You're a real asshole," Amir seethed through gritted teeth. 
As our heated exchange echoed within the sterile confines of the ward, the tension spiked as a nurse and doctor burst in. My reputation had preceded me in the hospital nestled within the Highland Hills, a domain long associated with my family. Every soul within these walls recognized me as Philip Cornell! 
"Mr. Cornell..." the doctor began. 
"I'm taking my wife home," I spat, my frustration mounting. I demand to take Sarah home, far removed from the chaos and annoyance of these people! 
"Y-yes, Mr. Cornell," the doctor responded hesitantly. 
"I won't allow it! I brought Mrs. Cornell here because she's sick! Her fever hasn't gone down yet!" Amir Benner shouted with frustration. 
I lunged forward, forcefully pressing him against the unforgiving wall. The doctor and nurse recoiled in shock, their eyes widening with alarm, but Mr. Benner stood firm, unyielding in the face of my aggression. 
The surge of violence within me surged as I witnessed Mr. Benner's tender care for my wife. Our gazes locked in a silent battle, each glance piercing like a blade, slashing through the tension between us. 
"Sarah is my wife! Whatever I do with her is none of your f\[u\]cking business!" I snarled. 
"Mr. Cornell, Mr. Benner, please Please refrain from violence here. We implore you. This is a hospital, and you're disturbing the patients," the nurse pleaded. 
"Mr. Benner, I'm sorry, but Mr. Cornell is the patient's husband. We'll honor the wishes of the primary family," the doctor explained diplomatically. 
"This hospital is worthless!" Amir Benner exclaimed. 
The doctor and nurse nervously swallowed. 
I scoffed. "It's fortunate you don't run this place." 
Unable to act further, he cast a final glance at my wife before exiting the ward. 
Just moments later, Sarah was nestled in my embrace as we made our way down the hallway toward the exit.  
The frigid air pierced her skin, causing her to tremble, while her heated breath danced against my neck. Her feverish, luminous skin seemed to ignite upon contact with mine. I paid no mind to any potential judgments from the hospital, taking my sick wife home. 
I was resolute in my actions, my frustration a searing inferno burning within. Trust was a luxury that people couldn't afford, especially not when it came to Amir Benner. 
As we reached the car, I turned to Alex with a command. "Contact Ethan Vanderbilt. Tell him to meet us at Serenity Pines Estate." 
"Right away, boss," he replied dutifully. 
Guiding Sarah into the car, she continued to cling to my arm as we settled into the backseat.  
"I-it's cold," she murmured. 
"Please turn the heater on," I instructed the driver. 
It took a while for Sarah to ease into the warmth, but my mind was ablaze with turmoil, feeling like my chest was engulfed in flames. 
*** 
Sarah lay on the bed as my friend Ethan examined her. Despite being a surgeon currently assigned to a different hospital, I had called him over to Alex's even though it was late at night to check on my wife. 
"Do you know when she was last given medication at the hospital?" Ethan inquired. 
I shrugged, unable to provide a precise answer. 
Ethan's sigh conveyed his exasperation at my vague response. "I'll contact the hospital to confirm. What happened to cause your wife to fall ill?" 
Knowing Ethan was not only a doctor but also a friend, I disclosed the truth. "I let her stay outside the villa, leaving her in the pouring rain." 
"Good grief," he muttered under his breath. 
While Ethan phoned the hospital, my gaze lingered on Sarah, my fists involuntarily clenching. The disturbing image that had haunted me earlier, standing at the bedside, seemed etched into my mind, refusing to fade. Before heading to the hospital, I instructed Alex to ensure they replaced the bedsheet.  
Momentarily consumed by the haunting vision of my wife, I was brought back to the present by Ethan's voice. "I'll give her an IV now." 
As Ethan administered the medication, Sarah continued to shiver from the cold. 
"I'll take my leave," Ethan announced. 
After seeing Ethan off outside Serenity Pines Estate, I headed back inside to change into fresh clothes and get ready for bed. 
Minutes crawled by before I reclaimed my place beside Sarah on the bed. 
"So cold..." she murmured, her body shivering with an unseen chill. 
I drew her trembling form closer to mine, sharing whatever warmth I could offer. Her eyes fluttered open briefly, revealing a gaze filled with confusion and vulnerability. Her image was enough to awaken my raging libido. 
Not only to shield her from the cold but also because my overwhelming desire to possess her was escaping, I hovered over Sarah. 
"Haah..." Her moan echoed through the room, a visceral response to the overwhelming intensity of my arousal. 
"Remember that I am your husband, and no other man should dare to lay a hand on you."
###chapter 6: A Woman Scorned 
**Sarah**  

My senses are enveloped in a fog, leaving me feeling disconnected from my being. I am only aware of Philip's familiar touch and the warmth of his kisses upon my lips and neck. Yet, I find myself lacking the strength to respond, delve deeper, and confront reality.   
Darkness gripped me fiercely, dragging me into the depths of a distant realm within my dream. 
Gently, my eyelids fluttered open, pulling me from a deep sleep. As awareness seeped in, I struggled to piece together recent events, finding myself in the familiar confines of the bedroom I shared with Philip.  
The memories flood back, the last clear one being outside the villa, rain pelting down as Philip dragged me away, leaving me until I succumb to unconsciousness.  
Unwanted tears traced down my cheeks, a bitter reminder of how fate has toyed with me. A sudden knock on the door startles me out of my reverie, breaking the heavy silence of the room.   
"Sarah?" a voice called from beyond the door. I hastily wiped away my tears as though chastising myself for showing vulnerability before making my way to the door. 
Opening it, I was met by one of the maids from the Cornell mansion; her eyebrows arched in subtle scrutiny.  
"I'll clean the room," she stated casually, her tone betraying no hint of warmth or empathy. Among the staff, she was the one who consistently treated me with the least kindness. 
"Why are you here?" I inquired. Is today the scheduled day to clean the villa? 
"Madam sent me and three other maids to Serenity Pines Estate," she replied. "Boss Philip called and requested to tidy up the villa because he mentioned that your body couldn't handle it." She nonchalantly glanced at her newly manicured nails, subtly insinuating a lack of efficiency in maintaining the mansion. 
"I'll handle our room with Philip. You guys can take care of the other rooms," I directed. 
She scoffed before heading towards the adjacent room. 
Feeling slightly dizzy and struggling to recall the events of the previous night, I made my way down to the kitchen for some water. Unaware of the cause, I was experiencing a sense of queasiness, potentially attributed to either the flu or medication. 
Glancing at the clock on the wall, I noted that my husband was already in his office. Lost in thought, I was startled by the sound of a car pulling up in front of our villa. 
Grappling with the idea of welcoming an unexpected guest, my thoughts raced through my mind, hoping against hope that the visitor wasn't my mother-in-law, who had just randomly come to Serenity Pines Estate without notice.  
However, my apprehension heightened as Megan emerged from the sleek Porsche Boxster parked outside, clad in a striking red dress that accentuated her curves. As she removed her sunglasses and met my gaze, I couldn't help but wonder what had brought her here. 
A rush of embarrassment flooded through me as I stood there in my dishevelled sleepwear, my hair in wild disarray. My throat constricted with the pressing uncertainty of what she could want from me. 
Her eyes roamed the expanse of the villa as though expecting something hidden beneath her gaze, while her presence left me unsettled. 
"Ms. Megan, would you like something to drink?" the maid asked, smoothly taking charge of welcoming the guest while my mind swirled with questions. 
Megan was offered juice and placed on the center table before her. 
"I'm here for one reason," Megan declared, producing divorce agreement papers from her bag and casually laying them on the table, then exclaimed, "Divorce Philip!" 
My lips parted, leaving my mind scrambling to catch up with her audacious declaration. Did I hear her correctly? 
"I heard Philip caught you last night with another man here. If you're not happy in your relationship, don't worry. I'm kind enough to help you leave your relationship with Philip," she said. 
"I'm not divorcing Philip!" I blurted out. Was this woman serious? 
"Come on, Sarah. Don't be a b!tch, and sign the papers! I've kept in touch with Philip for three years straight. I let you take my place as Mrs. Philip Cornell, but I've got bored of the charade. Playing these games is exhausting, you know? It's better to clear the air than to keep dragging this out," Megan remarked casually. 
My chest constricted at her words. A secret relationship with Philip for three years? 
While my husband is f\[u\]cking me, is he continuing his relationship with Megan?  
If so, where did I stand in Philip's heart for three years? Is that why I'm doomed never to win his love? 
Megan appeared to anticipate my thoughts. "Philip and I have crossed paths at various business conferences and trips abroad. He's f\[u\]cking good! I enjoy the way he takes charge..." A peculiar grin formed on her lips. 
I masked the urge to burst into tears from Megan's probing gaze. Deep within, a tempest of emotions raged as I grappled with the notion that Megan was playing with my heartstrings. Every fiber of my being resisted accepting her words as truth, clinging desperately to the belief that it was all nonsense! I don't see Philip as a cheater! 
However, my eyes inadvertently drifted to Megan's neck, adorned with the expensive necklace I once spotted in Philip's drawer. It was unmistakable evidence of Megan's significance in Philip's life. I received nothing in return, yet he kicked me out last night from the villa.  
"Leave, Megan!" were the words that escaped my lips. 
"What?" Her eyes widened in surprise. 
"I said, leave. This is my home! I don't care if you're here to meet my husband, sneaking around, or having an affair with him! This is Serenity Pines Estate, and this property belongs to me!" I growled. "It's my decision who I allow to stay in this villa!" 
It's agonizing to know she still has a relationship with Philip, but I refuse to let her dictate to me just because she's returned. It's painful! But I'll reserve my tears for moments when these people aren't around to witness my vulnerability. 
"I'll report you to Philip! I'll tell him everything!" Megan threatened. 
Her words pierced my heart like a dagger, plunging me into a pit of despair. How bitterly unjust it felt that she could effortlessly engage with Philip while I struggled to have even a casual chat with my husband. 
"Sarah! That's Ms. Megan! What significance do you hold in Boss Philip's life? You're just a homewrecker who offered herself when Boss needed a bride instead of marrying Ms. Megan!" the maid interjected. 
With a fierce glare burning in my eyes, I lunged forward, seized the juice she had prepared for Megan, and hurled it onto her face. She almost gasped in shock. 
"Is this the behavior they teach at Cornell Mansion? Clearly, they didn't teach you proper manners! I am not Sarah; I am your Madam Sarah! Leave!" My voice reverberated throughout the villa. 
The maid was taken aback, but she fell silent in fear as she met my glaring eyes. 
"You are a rude, uneducated woman! Well, that's right! You didn't continue your studies because you expected to be content with Philip's wealth," Megan sneered. 
"I'll say it again, the two of you, leave my villa right now!" I thundered, my voice echoing through the corridors with intensity. 
"You'll leave here soon, too! Trust me!" Megan spat out the words like venom as she stormed out of the villa, leaving a wake of tension in her path.  
The maid left behind-visibly shaken. 
"Do you not know where the door is?" I mused. 
Sneering, the maid exited the villa. 
With a heavy heart and trembling hands, I retrieved the divorce papers that Megan callously left on the table. Clutching them tightly, I trudged back to the primary bedroom, each step echoing the pain that tore through my soul. 
"Madam Sarah, are you okay? Boss Philip told us you were sick, so he sent us here to take care of the villa all day," another maid explained, having witnessed everything. 
I nodded at her and returned to the bedroom.  
It's disheartening to be compassionate when, ultimately, people exploit your kindness. So if Megan or the earlier maid chose to report me to Madam Cornell and Philip, then so be it. I'm deeply hurt by what I heard and by my current situation. 
The crushing weight of reality settled upon me as I stepped back into the room, and finally, the floodgates of my pent-up tears burst open. Three years of deception came crashing down around me while Megan's words echoed hauntingly in my mind; I didn't want to accept it because of the fragile hope I clung to. 
My phone rang on the bedside table, stopping my tears. 
With a shaky breath, I answered the call. "H-hello!" 
"Sarah, it's me," came the familiar voice of my brother.
###chapter 7: Grown Distant 
**Sarah** 

I was caught off guard when Amir's voice echoed through the phone. The cliché of being shocked barely captures the depth of my surprise. For a brief moment, my thoughts faltered as a wave of disbelief swept over me. 
Amir's resentment towards me stemmed from a misunderstanding regarding his girlfriend, an accusation I vehemently denied. Despite my attempts to explain, he stopped all communication for three long years. 
"Brother?" I interjected, attempting to cloak my uncertainty with a hint of reassurance. 
"Yes, that's right!" His confirmation echoed hollowly, a stark reminder of the chasm between us. 
The ache of longing for my brother pierced through me like a dagger. Yet, the cruel reality remained-he had already severed our ties. In the pregnant pause that followed, I believed he sensed the tumult of emotions raging within me, wordlessly echoing the void between us. 
"Listen, I understand there's been tension for three years, but blood runs deep between us. We've always leaned on each other," Amir said.  
"You severed that bond when you chose to believe and prioritize your toxic girlfriend over me!" The words slipped from my lips, dripping with resentment. In my anger, I even forgot her name. 
"Sarah, Jess is a good woman. We're getting married soon," his voice rang through the line. 
Ah, Jessica Woods! The name echoed in my mind like a sinister refrain. With a bitter laugh, I couldn't help but scoff at the cruel irony of it all. 
"Well, congratulations! Is that the sole purpose of your call? To flaunt in my face that despite her reprehensible actions, you're choosing to marry her?" 
'Join me in my foolishness!' That's the sentiment I want to convey. It seems like folly has taken root within my family. I've long confided in Amir about Jessica's true feelings towards him, how she doesn't truly love him and is only interested in Benner's wealth. 
But here's the kicker: Amir's infatuation with Jessica was so intense that he hung on her every word despite my warnings.  
I went to the same college as Jessica and found out she was having an affair with a professor and flirting with other students. I told Amir about it, but like a viper slithering into the garden of trust, she poisoned his mind against me, weaving a tapestry of lies and manipulation that clouded his judgment and obscured the truth. 
In retaliation, Jessica subjected me to all manner of torment at school. She harassed me relentlessly, even spreading malicious rumors that I was pregnant and the father had an addiction. Naturally, none of it was true! 
Despite my attempts to share this with Amir, he didn't listen, even going so far as to accuse me of causing the rift in his relationship due to alleged bullying. 
I should have reveled in their breakup, but I was overshadowed by Jessica's sinister manipulation of my brother, leaving me feeling utterly abandoned and betrayed.  
Then came the incident on the yacht when Jessica fell into the water; Amir not only ignored my pleas but also accused me of nearly causing her drowning. 
Faced with such unjust blame and betrayal, I transferred schools to Crestwood University and started anew in Highland Hills City. 
"Listen, that's just one reason I called you. I genuinely wanted to check on you. I brought you to the hospital last night after finding you outside your villa. But despite your lingering flu, your husband shamelessly insisted on taking you home. I assumed you were content with your life after leaving Grandpa Mitchell's estate, cutting ties with me, and marrying into the Cornells." 
'I thought so too... I thought my life would be happier.'  
His question reignited a tempest within me, threatening to unleash a torrent of tears once more. 
"You brought me to the hospital?" The recollection of my dream, where Amir's face was a blur, suddenly felt real. 
"Yes, but your husband callously brought you back home. He showed no concern even if you were on the brink of illness in your villa!" His tone betrayed his frustration. 
My lips twisted into a tight, bitter line as a surge of emotions threatened to engulf me. The validity of Amir's words cut deep, especially after encountering Philip's audacious ex-fiancée, who callously suggested I should leave my husband as if it were an easy undertaking. 
"I'll take you back to the hospital now to ensure you're okay," Amir offered. 
As my strength waned and a deep longing to see Amir grew within me, I fervently agreed to his proposal. 
*** 
I had the driver drop me off at the hospital where my brother and I had arranged to meet. Wanting to avoid any speculation or questions from Philip in case someone spotted Amir and me outside, I deemed it the safest option. 
As I wandered down the echoing hallway, bathed in the sterile glow of fluorescent lights, a sudden beep interrupted the solemn silence. I glanced at my phone, revealing a message from my husband, like a whisper in the cacophony of my thoughts. 
Philip: Did you go to the hospital? 
I was sure the driver had informed him. 
Sarah: Yes. 
As expected, there was no further reply. Our communication typically followed this pattern: one question, one answer. 
Heading to the hospital garden, I spotted Amir sitting alone on a spacious bench, accompanied by a burly man who was his bodyguard. As his gaze fell upon me, he surged up from his perch and closed the distance between us. 
"Let me help you. Are you alright?" He gently touched my neck and forehead, checking for any signs of flu.  
His age was evident, bearing the unmistakable imprint of time's passage. Ten years my senior, he now stood at thirty-two. As he led me to the bench, the warmth of his touch grounded me, offering solace amidst the turmoil brewing within. Settling onto the seat, a wave of emotions threatened to overwhelm me, the sting of tears lingering at the corners of my eyes. 
"God, I miss you so much," he muttered. 
"I hate you," I whispered, though it sounded more like it came out of my nose because I miss my brother too. "Three years of silence, all because of Jessica!" 
He winced. "I'm sorry... I know I've been a dick. Honestly, I didn't plan on seeing you, but when I saw you unconscious right in front of your villa, I couldn't help but worry about you. What happened to you?" 
I made the dramatic choice to sweep the topic of his girlfriend under the rug, as he clearly avoided it whenever Jessica was mentioned. 
"I'm fine. It was a little miscommunication and misunderstanding between my husband and me." 
"He's a dick!" 
"Brother, please... It's unreasonable for us to talk about my husband when you constantly avoid the topic of Jessica," I couldn't help but complain, my tone tinged with frustration and disappointment. 
He pursed his lips and shrugged. Soon enough, we changed the subject. He asked about my studies and chosen life, and I responded with fabrications woven like a tangled web of deceit.  
I know my brother, and he'll take action in ways I wouldn't expect if I told him about the mistreatment I received from my in-laws. 
"Grandpa Mitchell may be weak now, but he's still holding onto his disappointment about your choice in marriage," Amir expressed. 
"I hope he's managing okay," I responded, a tinge of sadness coloring my words. 
Grandpa Mitchell had always been my anchor support during the rocky times in my relationship with my father and Amir. But when I decided to marry Philip, he found it difficult to accept, ultimately leading him to cut ties with me. The idea of facing his friend's family, whom he had hoped I would marry, was too painful for him to bear, as it meant losing face in our circle. 
I acknowledge my mistakes. I abandoned everything positive in pursuit of a life with Philip. However, dwelling on regrets serves no purpose now. 
Feeling unwell, I visited a clinic after catching up with Amir. Despite my reluctance to have him accompany me, Amir insisted on coming along. But to avoid any unwanted inquiries, I refrained from using my married name, introducing myself as Sarah Mitchell. 
They ran some tests on me. And then, like a thunderbolt in the night, his words pierced the air, "Congratulations, Ms. Mitchell, you are pregnant!" 
In that fleeting moment, the very fabric of my world shifted beneath my feet.
###chapter 8: Conception of Hope 
**Sarah**  

My excitement bubbled uncontrollably, an unstoppable force urging me to share the impending news with Philip. I couldn't shake the feeling that this revelation might redefine our entire dynamic. Yet, amidst the tumult of emotions swirling within me, I couldn't ignore the gnawing sensation that Amir's reaction wouldn't match my euphoria. 
"You're pregnant, and yet that jerk left you stranded outside your villa, soaked in the rain, and caused you to faint? I'll have a word with him, Sarah! He needs to face the consequences!" Amir seethed with anger. 
"Please don't! They don't know about my background as a Benner," I pleaded. 
"What?" Amir felt taken aback. 
"When I enrolled in university, I used Grandpa's last name, Mitchell. To everyone else, I'm Sarah Mitchell, an orphan," I explained to my brother. 
"So, that's why he didn't know we're related." 
"Please, leave Philip alone!" I redirected my plea to Amir. 
I expected Philip to react differently upon learning the truth rather than offering a listening ear. For three long years, I maintained a web of lies, all to shield them from the devastating reality of my disownment by my own family.  
How would revealing this truth affect the reputation of the respected Cornell family? 
After a moment fraught with tension, I parted ways with Amir.  
He pointed me towards the house next to Serenity Pines Estate. I was surprised to realize that Amir was the one who had moved into that very house I had seen yesterday. 
As I stepped out of the hospital, I directed the driver to Philip's office, the weight of a small round cake nestled in my grip.  
Is it naïve of me to imagine that this tiny bundle will transform our marriage? The anticipation of parenthood courses through me, refusing to be ignored. 
Several faces in Philip's workplace are familiar to me, none more so than the ostentatious secretary stationed outside his door. She's the regular recipient of the lunch I deliver to my husband's workplace. What strikes me is her consistently snug attire, meticulously crafted to accentuate every curve, from her shapely legs to her generous cleavage. 
It irks me that she spends ample time with Philip, flaunting her nearly bare figure in his presence daily. 
"Boss Philip isn't here; he's off to an external meeting," she informed me, arms crossed defensively. 
"And when will he return?" I inquired. 
"I'm not sure!" That was nothing short of a fabrication! Alex runs a tight ship, and this secretary, being one of his staff, undoubtedly has every detail of Philip's schedule at her fingertips. 
"I'll text Alex," I declared, reaching into my bag for my phone. However, she swiftly intervened, perhaps fearing repercussions if I were to relay my grievances to her boss. 
"No need. Yeah, I recall the boss will be returning in an hour," she divulged.  
I wanted to scrutinize her, but I didn't have time for these kinds of people. 
"I'll wait inside Philip's office. Please open the door and put this cake in the fridge," I instructed her. Her expression contorted into a deep frown as she reluctantly inserted the key into the lock of my husband's office door. 
Given Philip's meticulous nature, he detests any speck of dust, and his immaculate office reflects that.  
The room stretched out expansively, dominated by his grandiose desk positioned at the distant end, commanding attention. On the right, a glimmering glass window stood as a barrier, obscuring the breathtaking vista of Highland Hills City. Meanwhile, nestled on the left, Philip's modest sleeping quarters offered solace during those rare occasions when he didn't return to Serenity Pines because of his relentless workload. 
After surveying the room, I settled onto the plush couch and picked up a magazine from the rack. 
"Are you sure you'll wait here?" the secretary inquired, standing beside the door. 
"Yes. I'll leave if Philip doesn't arrive within an hour," I replied. 
I wasn't feeling well and needed to ensure our villa was in order when Philip came home. When the secretary was out of sight, I retrieved the bond paper with the doctor's diagnosis printed on it-I am six weeks pregnant. 
With a smile, I glanced at my wristwatch, indicating it was only three o'clock in the afternoon. Contemplating the possibility of Philip being too engrossed in his work to return promptly, I consciously decided not to disrupt him. Instead, I resolved to craft a special dinner at home, eagerly awaiting the moment I could share the exhilarating news with him in our own space. 
However, a wave of unease gripped my stomach just ten minutes later. Hurriedly, I made my way to the restroom within his office and vomited. The dizziness overwhelmed me as I struggled to maintain my balance. Desperately yearning for solace, I sought refuge in the sanctuary of Philip's private chamber. 
As I lay on his bed, I allowed the door to creak slightly, feeling my husband's comforting presence. Running my hand over the soft pillow, I conjured Philip's face in my mind, inhaling his lingering scent on the sheets. 
At that moment, a sense of tranquility washed over me, soothing my emotions and coaxing sleep to embrace me... 
*** 
I didn't know how many hours had passed, but I heard a series of moans outside the slightly ajar door, enough to wake me up. 
The secretary's voice pierced through the walls of the extension room, echoing with a foreboding resonance that sent shivers down my spine. 
"Hmmm... yes! Right there, boss! Lick my pvssy! Ahhhh!" 
My eyes stretched wide with disbelief, and a torrent of inexplicable sensations surged through my veins, electrifying every fiber of my being, as her intoxicating moans danced provocatively in my ears. 
'She's having sex with Philip?' 
I didn't know what to do, whether to confront them or let myself listen to the ongoing affair right in my husband's office. 
The haunting image of my husband pushing the secretary onto the wide desk seared into my mind, leaving me reeling with anguish. Sitting at one corner of the bed, I curled up, clutching my legs tightly as torrents of tears streamed down both of my cheeks. 
"Would you be able to leave your wife for me if she knew about our secret affair?" 
I heard them exchanging passionate kisses. Glancing at my wristwatch, it showed past six in the evening. 
Philip was fooling me! How long has my husband been in a relationship with the secretary? 
It was painful to consider that Philip's prolonged stays in the office stemmed from his preference for his secretary's company over mine. 
"Please... give it to me!" the secretary murmured, "I'm wiggling my hips for you. Please give me that hard c0ck! Ohhhh!" 
My chest constricted, suffocated by the cacophony of passionate moans echoing from beyond the walls. Tears streamed down my cheeks, a silent testament to the agony tearing through my soul. 
Each moan shattered my heart into a million irreparable fragments. Alone in that extension room, I had to witness Philip's brazen betrayal as the raw truth laid bare before me, tearing away any remnants of trust or hope. 
"Yes, f\[u\]ck that pussy! Harder! Harder!" 
My fist clenched on the bed sheets as a wave of horror washed over me. I had no idea how long they'd been f\[u\]cking. Tears silently streamed down my cheeks as their moans pierced the air like a knife, each thrust and collision of skin stabbing at my soul. 
Is this how stupid Philip sees me? 
The elusive dream of capturing his love may haunt me indefinitely. 
After lingering for another torturous thirty minutes, I finally resolved to leave the private room. 
To my utter dismay and disgust, the carpet greeted me with the sight of two discarded condoms. The sheer audacity and blatant disrespect displayed in leaving such a repulsive mess behind filled me with an overwhelming sense of shame. 
When I left Philip's office, his secretary was conspicuously absent from her desk. In a daze, I made my way to the elevator, feeling the weight of scrutinizing glances from the other employees. 
As I stepped into the elevator cabin, a deluge of tears surged forth, no longer restrained by the façade of composure I had maintained moments earlier. My lips trembled uncontrollably as I met the gaze of my reflection in the mirror, confronting the visage of a wretched soul staring back at me.  
With every fiber of my being, I clung to my chest, feeling as though the weight of the world was crushing my very breath. 
I thought of using sunglasses to shield my tears as the elevator doors opened in the lobby. 
The bitter reality sank in as I reflected on the illusion that the baby would mend the chasm in my relationship with Philip. He would never reciprocate the profound love I harbored for him. 
With silent sobs wracking my body, I instructed the driver to send me home, my tears silently staining the upholstery of the back seat. 
Arriving at Serenity Pines Estate, I shed my clothes along with my illusions, seeking solace in my embrace, forsaken by all but myself. 
I stumbled upon Megan's divorce papers that she had given me earlier, and it felt like a dagger through my heart. Once more, tears flooded my eyes.  
What do these other women possess that I lack in Philip's eyes?  
Why am I not enough? 
I've decided to depart from Philip's world, especially now with a baby on the way. I refuse to embark on the journey of pregnancy, burdened solely by resentment. 
As I waited for Philip at the villa, the clock ticked past eleven before his car finally pulled up to the grand entrance of Serenity Pines Estate. As he stepped inside, the scent of a recent shower wafted toward me, an ironic detail that sparked a bittersweet amusement within me. 
I fought back a bitter, mocking laugh, feeling the urge to despise myself for the sheer foolishness of loving someone capable of such deceit! 
Philip was accustomed to discovering me in that spot each time he returned home. Our gazes locked, and with venom dripping from my words, I rose to my feet to confront the darkness that had settled on my lips. 
"Let's end this charade, Philip... Let's get a divorce"
###chapter 9: Whimper of Farewell 
**Sarah**   
Philip's arms folded tightly across his chest, a mysterious smile playing on his lips. The enigmatic gleam in his eyes hinted at depths of emotion I couldn't fathom. Yet, it was clear that my words had struck a nerve, and his reaction spelled trouble.  
"What's all this about?" he queried, a touch of amusement lacing his tone. Though not yet consumed by anger, his incredulity suggested he found my words utterly ridiculous.  
A wave of realization washed over me, accompanied by the relentless ache of the past two days. It spurred me to assert my desires.  
"I understand you want to end things, Philip. So, I'm granting you the freedom to pursue whomever you please." Be it Megan, his audacious secretary, or any other temptress lurking in the shadows, I refused to be the pitiful pawn left waiting at home!  
His reaction was immediate, fury igniting in his eyes as he seized my arms, drawing us together with an intensity that bordered on violence.  
"Why? So that you can be with the man you brought here last night?" His accusation cut through the tension like a knife.  
"Don't twist things around! I don't even know who that person is!" My protest was sharp but futile as I struggled against his unyielding grasp, unable to break free.  
"Ugh!"   
With a brutal shove, he sent me crashing onto the couch, the impact twisting my neck and hips with savage force. And then, a surge of fear enveloped me as he settled himself at the center table, his presence looming over me like a predatory monarch, poised to strike at any moment. It felt like I was caught in the stare of a fierce tiger, just waiting to attack its prey.  
"Sarah, you willingly signed up for this chaotic hell with me! Convince me why I should entertain your ridiculous proposal!" His demand echoed in the room.  
Summoning courage, I recalled the secretary's distressing moans from earlier.  
"Do you want an answer? Do you want a reason? We don't love each other!" I retorted, my voice trembling with defiance.  
"We never loved each other from the beginning!" His retort reverberated with suppressed rage. "Ever since we signed the contract and prenuptial agreement three years ago, we've been aware that love wasn't growing between us! So, give me a f\[u\]cking reason! Why do you want a divorce?!"  
Tears blurred my vision, a blend of anguish and apprehension. "I married you when Megan left, and now that she's returned, she's reclaiming her role as your wife! Isn't that reason enough?"  
He gripped my chin forcefully, forcing me to meet his intense gaze. His words were sharp, digging into me like his fingers into my skin. "Do you think I'm a fool? You're using Megan's return as a pretext to leave me for your lover! You saw an opportunity and seized it!"  
'This pig!'  
"Do you need another reason? I despise this damned life!" I spat at him, feeling an agonizing stab in my chest. I was drained from two days of relentless tears. "I won't waste another moment resenting you if you're too selfish to grant me freedom!"  
The harsh reality is-I refuse to continue tormenting myself by foolishly holding onto a man who refuses to give me the love I rightfully deserve.  
"I demand respect, Philip!" I gave him a frigid stare.  
He released my chin, sneering, "Seriously? Coming from you? I was the one you cheated on our anniversary! And now you're gaslighting me, Sarah?"  
His eyes gleamed with memories of the previous night, stabbing into me with a cruel reminder.  
It's bitterly ironic; it's soul-crushing; my situation wrenches tears from my eyes.  
"The person in those photos is just a friend! He's just some classmate from the university where Jane and I studied! I don't know the person you found in the room, and that's the last explanation I'll offer! What more do you want?"  
"What I want is for you to stay here and play the role of the submissive wife, that is!" each word sliced into me like a razor from his mouth.  
Philip rose from his seat, striding purposefully toward the main door, leaving me in a state of frantic uncertainty. Where was he off to? Panic surged through me as I snatched the papers from the side table.  
"No! I want a divorce, Philip! I'm not asking for money or anything! I want to be free from this marriage!" My plea spilled out; desperation tinged every word.  
He spun on his heels to confront me again, his hand balling into a tight fist.  
"Tell me, Philip Did you ever, even once in three years, imagine yourself loving me?"   
I dared to hope, foolishly clinging to the possibility that his response could somehow alter my course. Yet, he only met my anticipation with a sneer, his chuckle echoing with venomous mockery.   
"Don't make me laugh, Sarah. Spare me your delusions! Everything between us has been purely about pleasure and business."  
My tears cascaded down my cheeks like a torrential storm, driven by the cutting winds of his indifference. The pain was unbearable, suffocating me with its tight grip.  
If he couldn't love me, fine, but to trample upon me with such disrespect? It was a dagger to my already wounded heart. I had to cling to what little remained of my sanity to claw my way out of this abyss of suffering. He must agree to the divorce for my survival.  
Agonizingly, I sank to my knees upon the frigid marble, anguish ripping through my heart. "Please"  
His fury intensified at the pitiful sight before him. With venomous spite, he closed in on me, snatching the papers from my grasp with a cruel force. Without remorse, he scrawled his signature across the documents and callously hurled them into my face.  
With a thunderous slam, he stormed out of the room. The metallic clang of the garage door opening resonated through the air, followed by the unmistakable roar of his sports car engine as he peeled away from Serenity Pines Estate, leaving behind a trail of bitterness and resentment.  
For what seemed like an eternity, I remained on my knees, aching with the weight of his departure. Alone, I wrapped my arms around myself, staring numbly at the scattered remnants of our failed marriage strewn across the floor.  
Should I be happy that this tumultuous exchange marked the most extended interaction Philip and I have shared in my memory, even if each word was a dagger to my soul? I suppose I should find some twisted joy in the fact that I'm finally breaking free from this wretched union now that the damned papers are signed.   
Soon enough, I'll revert to being Ms. Sarah Mitchell-the discarded relic of Philip's past, his ex-wife.  
***  
Philip didn't return home last night, leaving me in a state of uncertainty about his whereabouts. His message was crystal clear: he no longer wanted to be in my presence. Dealing with the emotional fallout left me with a splitting headache, which lingered until well into the afternoon as I struggled to tend to my well-being.  
My vision blurred as I sifted through the divorce papers, a weighty task compounded by the added revelation of the pregnancy test result.   
"I must remain resilient and prioritize my health for the baby's sake," I murmured.  
Wandering through the kitchen like a ghost without purpose, I clumsily tossed whatever fruits I could scavenge from the fridge into the blender, hoping to quell the gnawing ache in my stomach.  
Returning to the living room, I was met with the unwelcome sight of my mother-in-law sitting on the couch, her expression a blend of disapproval and disdain. The roaring of the blender likely drowned out the sound of her arrival.  
"Philip said you're divorcing! I'm here to ensure you're kicked out of Serenity Pines Estate immediately!" she spat venomously. I wasn't taken aback; her eagerness to see me ousted was as predictable as the sunrise. It would be a miracle if she showed an ounce of decency.  
Amir's words echoed in my mind like a beacon of hope. He offered me shelter in the neighboring villa if I needed it. And right now, I desperately need his help more than ever.   
"Please don't worry. You won't see me around starting tomorrow," I said casually.   
Presently, she maintains a rope to me as Philip's mother; thus, I shall uphold my reverence towards her for the time being.  
However, she suddenly felt dizzy, her hand instinctively reaching for her head and chest.  
"Oh my God I understand that you and Philip are going through a breakup, but could you please take me to the hospital? I think I'm having a migraine attack. Ow! Sarah, it hurts so much! Please, accompany me to the hospital," she pleaded.  
My concern for Philip's mother deepened. Despite the painful realization that she doesn't harbor any warmth towards me and the bleak prospect of fostering a harmonious relationship, I couldn't bear to leave her unattended.  
After assisting her, as I prepared to leave through the main door, I realized that the papers I had reviewed earlier were nowhere to be found on the center table.   
Did I misplace them?
###chapter 10: Love, Loss, and Betrayal 
Sarah  

Mrs. Cornell sat in the passenger seat of her car, her face pale and her movements unsteady as we headed toward the hospital.  
A voice of reason tugged at the corners of my mind, questioning the wisdom of my actions. Yet, despite enduring three years of her verbal abuse, I reminded myself that she was Philip's mother. 
This would be the final act of kindness. Once she was safely at the hospital, I resolved to inform Philip through Alex instead. 
Upon arrival, I reached out to support Mrs. Cornell as we made our way inside, my arm extended in an offer of assistance, which she seemed hesitant to accept. At the nurse's station, Mrs. Cornell inquired about Dr. Smith's whereabouts. Assuming she was familiar with the doctor's clinic, I refrained from questioning her and trailed behind. 
However, my surprise mounted as we proceeded down a hallway marked for the OB-Gyn department. 
"Um, Mrs. Cornell-" I began tentatively, only to be abruptly silenced. 
"Shut up! Just follow me!" she snapped, cutting off any further attempts at communication. 
Confusion gripped me as a whirlwind of questions stormed through my mind, leaving me disoriented in the unanticipated setting of the pregnancy specialist's hallway.  
Is Mrs. Cornell pregnant? That's the foremost question that leaps to mind. 
"I'm here for Dr. Smith," Mrs. Cornell announced to the two nurses stationed at the front desk, their mouths obscured by masks. 
"She's expecting you, Madam Cornell!" one of the nurses replied. 
With a sense of foreboding, they escorted me and my mother-in-law inside the clinic, where we were met by the imposing figure of a female doctor in her fifties. 
"She's the one!" Mrs. Cornell declared with significance. 
I struggled to grasp the situation, momentarily stunned as the two nurses restrained me. 
"W-what is the meaning of this?" I stammered, my voice trembling with confusion and fear as I struggled against their unyielding hold. Despite my frantic attempts to break free, they inexorably steered me towards the nearby sonography table; their determination left me utterly powerless. 
"Help me!" I cried out. 
The doctor remained silent, leaving me to grapple with a flood of tears as I desperately tried to make sense of the unfolding events. 
Consequently, she produced a syringe from her pocket and administered its contents into my arm. The effect was immediate, inducing dizziness and sapping my strength, dissuading my desire to leave the room. 
"Why would you do this to me?" I interrogated Mrs. Cornell sharply, fixing her with a cold stare. 
"I need to confirm if you're pregnant," she retorted. She snatched a piece of paper from her bag and flung it at my face, revealing she had taken the documents from the table earlier. Crossing her arms, she instructed the doctor firmly, "Proceed with the test!" 
"This is wrong..." I murmured weakly, tears welling up in my eyes, but my protests fell on deaf ears as the staff obediently carried out Mrs. Cornell's orders. 
Paralyzed by helplessness, they laid me on the sonology table, and my legs splayed apart as they conducted the test to confirm my alleged pregnancy.  
And then, as the doctor injected the medication, darkness descended upon me like a voracious predator, swallowing me whole. The world slipped away, leaving me suspended in a void of oblivion, unaware of what awaited me beyond the veil of unconsciousness. 
*** 
When I awoke, it felt like this moment could be the final unraveling of my sanity. The room around me was unfamiliar, filled with ominous devices on either side, and a profound sense of weakness gripped me.  
Tears surged in my eyes while an agonizing pain seared through me from between my legs. Unable to contain it, I found myself convulsing with sobs.  
What monstrous act had they inflicted upon me? 
Suddenly, Mrs. Cornell swept into the room like a storm, her presence sending a chill down my spine. Despite the swirling dizziness that threatened to engulf me, I fought to raise myself upright. But at that moment, I was overwhelmed by uncertainty. Should I unleash my anger on her? Would that be enough? 
"Why did you do this to me?" I managed to croak out to Mrs. Cornell, my voice barely audible. 
She remained icily stoic, sitting upon the chair beside the hospital bed with her features a mask of indifference amidst the turmoil engulfing me. 
"Because I don't like you," she retorted coldly, words slicing through the air like a blade of ice. 
"That's your grandchild! That's Philip's and my unborn baby!" I shouted at her, my words choked by sorrow, tears streaming down my face. Yes... I had sensed that if she learned of my pregnancy, I knew she wasted no time in arranging the removal of that child from my womb. As a mother, the loss pierced me to the core. 
With casual indifference, she retrieved a cigarette from her clutch bag, lighting it with practiced ease, and took a puff. 
"Sarah, I need your undivided attention for what I'm about to say. Once this cigarette is extinguished, so is our conversation You made a grave mistake three years ago when you married Philip. Do you know why? Because I harbored immense aspirations for Philip, as any mother would." 
She paused to inhale from her cigarette, the smoke swirling around her words. 
"During my youth, I fought tooth and nail to break free from the grasp of my parents, who were nothing more than farmers. The mud was gross, the food was yucky, and the old clothes always reminded me of the tough life I had to endure. When I became pregnant with my husband's child, I saw an opportunity-a chance to conceive a son who would carry me away from that life. That son was Philip." 
"Philip was my ticket to the world of the Cornells, a gateway to the life I craved. So, when you sought to enter our family through marriage, I saw through your intentions from the start. I understood your desire-to escape hardship and latch onto the wealth of the Cornells." 
She gripped my cheeks firmly, her gaze piercing. "In our family, only one serpent is worthy, and I won't allow anyone else to claim my throne!" 
Her eyes widened with such intensity that I barely recognized her at all. 
Tears streamed uncontrollably down my cheeks, drenching the pillow beneath my head in a pool of sorrow. 
"And let me tell you this, my dear," she sneered. "Philip was fully aware of everything! He never wanted a child with someone like you, a gold-digging orphan! You're divorcing, aren't you? Do you honestly believe he'd stay with you because you're having a baby? Do you think that's enough to salvage your marriage?" She chuckled, a sound that grated against my shattered heart.  
"My dear Sarah... I did the same tactic to my husband. Look at where my son is now-constantly showering me with wealth!" 
The staggering realization that Philip participated in this cruel betrayal ripped through me like a hurricane, tearing apart what little semblance of trust and hope remained in my shattered heart. My fist, clenched with such ferocity, became numb to the point where I could no longer discern if it were a part of me or merely an extension of the anguish consuming my soul. 
I feel like I'm losing my mind! How could Philip do this to our child? 
"Listen, Sarah! I won't tolerate you hovering around my son and ruining the life and future I've built for Philip!" She blew a thick cloud of smoke into my face. "No one but Megan will capture my son's heart! They love each other and removing you from my family's lives is only right!" 
Before I could respond, a knock echoed through the room. As the nurse entered, Megan followed, clad in a tight yellow dress. 
"M-Mrs. Cornell!" Megan's eyes widened, disbelief painting her features as she struggled to comprehend the scene before her. There I lay, a mere shadow of myself, resembling nothing more than a wilted vegetable, drained of vitality and spirit, upon the bed. 
"What happened to Sarah?" Fear tinged Megan's voice as she addressed Mrs. Cornell. 
"Don't be overly sympathetic, Megan. Everything's under control now that the deed is done. We can focus on preparing for your life with Philip," Mrs. Cornell replied, her smile lacking genuine warmth as she exited the ward. It's as though her actions towards me meant nothing! 
Alone with Megan, she glared at me, shaking her head in disdain. Her face twisted into a mask of scorn, stripping away the fake veneer of kindness she had previously worn. 
"Sarah, I've said it before-every choice we make carries consequences. You're fortunate you didn't go through with your pregnancy. Poor girl... I warned you, didn't I? Philip belongs to me. If only you had listened to me... Don't worry; I'll care for Philip, so your sacrifice won't be vain. Understand?" 
Both women seemed to have lost touch with reality, yet I sensed I might surpass their madness. 
I was denied respect, devoid of love, and even the one I had trusted to cherish me had been callously taken from me. 
Their actions reeked of heartlessness. The room reverberated with my unending sobs, a reflection of my sanity unraveling.
###chapter 11: Empty Cradle 
**Sarah**  

Darkness enveloped me-a certainty in the chaos. My heart wailed with an anguish so profound it pierced my very soul. What sin had I committed to deserve this torment? 
I dared to turn away from my marriage with Philip, but never did I envision the depths of his cruelty, stripping me of everything I held dear. 
For my heart bled so profusely that sensation eluded me, I was numb to the cascade of tears, leaving only the haunting embrace of grief. 
"Sarah! Sarah!" It's as though Amir was right before my eyes, within the stark confines of the hospital ward. Every fiber of my being ached to reach out to him, to envelop myself in his embrace, and to release the weight of my sorrow upon his shoulders. 
But my voice remains trapped, shackled by an invisible force. A silent plea resonates within me, urging the release of the pent-up emotions to share them with Amir. Yet, I am gripped by a suffocating weakness. 
"What have you done to her?!" Amir's voice reverberates through the room, punctuated by the violent expulsion of objects in his fury. 
The chaos within the hospital ward assaults my senses, yet I am strangely detached, an observer in my own body. I stare vacantly at Amir as though trapped within the confines of a dream. 
"M-Mr. Benner," the man in the white coat began, "she's been in a daze for three days now. She was sent here from the OB-GYN department." He paused briefly before continuing, "According to Dr. Smith's assessment, her baby didn't exhibit a heartbeat in the womb, prompting swift action from the hospital." It was evident that he was a doctor in this room. 
No, that's a lie! They took away my child! I wanted to scream the truth, but I lacked the strength. My voice remained trapped within me, lost in the haze of my mind while my body lay motionless in the hospital bed. 
"Where the hell is her husband?" Amir's voice was laced with anger. 
"We... we don't know," the doctor stammered. "Mrs. Cornell visited the patient on the first day, but no family member has been here since." 
"Boss, I have news for you!" Rey, Amir's secretary, interjected. "I got word that Mr. Philip Cornell went to Monaco to join a car racing event. He's been in Europe for three days." 
Can you believe that? While I grieve the loss of our child, Philip had the audacity to jet off and participate in a car racing event. 
"Sarah!" Amir's grasp tightened around mine, a silent affirmation of his unwavering support in that agonizing moment. 
My brother's voice trembled as tears streamed down his cheeks. "I'll take you home now! I won't allow you to continue like this," he said. 
Under the shroud of night, Amir took me out of the hospital and straight onto a private plane. Wherever he's taking me, I don't know. 
At present, my sole desire is to grieve the death of my baby. I yearn to pray for his soul's peace, to extend my apologies that his father callously denied him existence solely because Philip harbored disdain for me. The duration of my mourning remains uncertain, yet I solemnly vow to emerge from this abyss of anguish resilient and renewed. 
*** 
Amir brought me to Dubai; of that, I am certain. The familiarity of Grandpa Mitchell's mansion greeted me, a place I hadn't set foot in for three years. 
Our journey halted as the van pulled up to the grand entrance, where my grandfather, noticeably thinner since our last encounter, stepped out with a frown etched upon his face. 
"Why is that woman here?!" he bellowed, directing his anger at Amir. 
"Grandpa, please," my brother interjected, his voice filled with empathy. "Sarah lost her baby. She's been lost in grief for days." 
Though my grandfather huffed in response, a glimmer of concern flickered in his eyes. "After three years of absence, she returns as if nothing happened, neglecting an old man like me?" 
Amir faltered, struggling to find the right words to appease him. 
I understood my grandfather's frustration all too well. My actions, driven by a longing for Philip's affection, had caused me to turn my back on him-a pain I knew I couldn't erase with mere words. Though I yearned to reach out, to mend what I had broken, grief held me captive, rendering me motionless. 
"Take her to her room!" Grandpa Mitchell commanded before turning away. 
Amir crouched in front of me, assuming a posture reminiscent of a guardian looking after a child in need of guidance. "Grandpa Mitchell still holds love for you, you know. Despite his stubbornness, I'm certain he forgave you long ago." 
His fingers gently threaded through my hair before he directed the helper to escort me inside the mansion.  
As we stepped into the room, I once called mine, a wave of nostalgia crashed over me like a tidal wave. The air hung heavy with the intoxicating perfume of flowers, their scent weaving through the room like a ghost from my past. The bedroom sprawled across a spacious 100 square meters, accompanied by an adjoining wardrobe. 
"Miss Sarah!" Amanda's embrace enveloped me as she rushed forward. She was one of the two personal maids dedicated to my care in Grandpa Mitchell's mansion. Her age appeared to be fifty or beyond, marked by the wisdom etched on her features. She scrutinized my weathered skin and calloused hands, evidence of the labor I had endured over the past three years. "Sir Amir, what had happened to Miss Sarah?"  
"She suffered a miscarriage and is going through a divorce," Amir responded somberly. 
Amanda's sobs reverberated in the room; disbelief evident in her tear-filled eyes. Despite her emotional turmoil, she proceeded to bathe me, dress me, and carefully comb my hair. Throughout the process, I remained emotionally detached, unable to find the energy to respond to any inquiries. 
40 days... That's the pathetic duration I've foolishly allotted to wallow in grief over the loss of my baby. Then, perhaps, I'll attempt to claw my way out of the abyss where my soul has been mercilessly cast. 
*** 
"Sarah, what's wrong with you? You've been like this for two weeks now!" Amir's frustration seethed through his words as he confronted my silence, my demeanor, and my vacant gaze fixated beyond the room's confines. I could sense both his and Grandpa Mitchell's concern for me. 
"Sir, I'm acutely aware of my position as nothing more than a lowly maid in this grand mansion, but I feel compelled to clarify Miss Sarah's situation." 
All eyes turned towards Amanda as if she held the key to unlock the mysteries of my troubled soul.  
"I may not be an expert in navigating mental struggles, but having cared for Miss Sarah for quite some time and being a woman myself, I can recognize that she's grieving the loss of her baby. Let's allow her the necessary time, as the pain of losing a child is deeply painful. I have faith in Miss Sarah's resilience; I believe she will find her strength again. At this moment, the tragedy is still too fresh, making it incredibly challenging to come to terms with such a profound loss." 
I couldn't suppress it any longer; tears streamed down my face, each droplet a painful reminder of my anguish. My chest constricted as if being slowly crushed, finding solace only in the realization that someone finally comprehended my pain.  
Gasps filled the room as I allowed myself to show expression for the first time. 
"Sarah!" Amir's voice rang out, tinged with his emotional turmoil. His fist clenched tightly as he fought back the tears. "We're here to support you, alright?" 
I nodded, unable to find words amidst the overwhelming swell of emotions. 
Amanda ran her fingers through my hair, and I wrapped my arms around her waist. I wasn't happy, but it felt good to have someone understand how I felt. 
*** 
Thirty days have passed since I began my journey toward healing. With Amanda's unwavering support and the assistance of another maid, I'm successfully maneuvering through the mansion, rediscovering the comforting familiarity of my surroundings. 
Gradually, I'm managing to respond to a few basic inquiries. Yet, simmering beneath the surface of my progress is a seething rage directed at Philip. He violated me in every aspect-as a spouse, as a woman, and as a mother! 
Strolling through the garden, the last thing I anticipated was encountering Amir and his girlfriend, Jessica Woods, seated at a garden table.  
The aura emanating from this woman practically shrieked trouble. Despite the warning signs, I dared to approach, curious to discern whether she was worthy of my brother's affection. 
If she's no longer the bitch she was.
###chapter 12: Tongue of Malice 
**Sarah**  

Amir rose to his feet as he caught sight of me approaching them. His expression betrayed surprise; evidently, he hadn't anticipated my emergence from the room and subsequent stroll around the mansion. 
"Uhm..." His throat cleared before he glanced at his fiancée. "Jess and I came here to discuss our wedding plans with Grandpa Mitchell." Amir adjusted one of the chairs nearby. "Please, have a seat." 
"We're here to finalize details for the upcoming wedding. It's set for four months from now. I'd love to see you as a bridesmaid," Amir stated. 
"Babe, Sarah might not be well on our wedding day. You know? As much as I wanted her to be a part of my bridal party, she might end up causing disruptions. I hope she's okay," Jessica remarked, though her smile seemed somewhat forced. 
"Miss, what can I get you to drink?" Amanda inquired politely. 
"A cold tea, please," I responded simply. 
Amir seemed taken aback by the sound of my voice. 
"I'm glad to see you're on the mend..." He reached out to hold my hand. "I'm looking forward to what lies ahead and to your recovery. You're still young, Sarah... There are plenty of men out there who would offer you genuine love. You'll build a new and better future." 
I remained silent, lifting the glass of cold tea to my lips without responding.  
"Yeah, Sarah. Perhaps your baby is destined to die," Jessica's words struck me like a cruel blow. This wench! I thought she had changed, but her venomous tongue proved otherwise. 
"Jess, that's a terrible thing to say," Amir interjected, his voice tinged with disbelief. 
"What? Did I say something wrong? We're not even sure what her baby would look like. Besides, it's embarrassing if people find out there's a single mother in your family. I can't imagine raising a child without a husband. So, I think it's okay that her baby is dead." Her words hung in the air like a toxic cloud, poisoning the atmosphere with their heartless disregard for the pain and suffering they inflicted. 
"Jess!" Amir's voice rebuked, laced with disbelief and disappointment, shaking the air around us. He couldn't fathom the audacity of the woman's words or comprehend the cruelty spilling from her lips. 
My anger surged. How dare she presume to dictate what is acceptable? Did she not grasp the turmoil I was enduring, trying to piece my life back together amidst grief? 
"I'm going back to my room," I said quietly to Amir. 
I could see the apology in my brother's eyes. Yet, I couldn't comprehend why he allowed Jessica to manipulate him so easily. 
Standing up, I grabbed the pitcher of cold tea that Amanda had prepared. They assumed I was retreating to my room to drink it alone. 
"Even better, let's refocus on our wedding plans," Jessica said with a forced sweetness to Amir.  
But their shock was palpable as I meticulously emptied the pitcher over Jessica's head, the contents washing over her in a frigid cascade, small cubes of ice dancing amidst the deluge of cold tea. 
"Sarah!" Amir's shock echoed in his exclamation at my actions. 
"Ahhhh!" Jessica shivered violently from the sudden cold. "You b!tch!" As she stood, her scream pierced the air, the liquid cascading from her blonde hair. 
Suppressing their laughter, the two maids beside me struggled to maintain composure while I remained stoic. 
"Enjoy the rest of your day," I uttered with a calculated calmness, then pivoted away from the unfolding chaos. Amir's eyes widened in bewilderment, caught in the tumultuous aftermath of my action. 
"Come back here, you shameless wench!" Jessica's angry voice echoed after me as I heard Amir attempting to calm her, caught in the situation's awkwardness. 
Amir lacked the resolve to reprimand me, his soft spot for me amplified by my ongoing grief. Furthermore, I was confident he understood the motivation behind my actions towards his girlfriend. 
"That wench! If she ever hurt you, I'd wage war on her! I wouldn't care if Sir Amir fired me!" Amanda's support echoed through my ears. 
Retreating to my bedroom, I settled by the window, gazing at the serene view beyond the mansion's walls.  
Amir was right. I deserved more than this dismal reality. I vowed to construct a grander dream, where I would find a partner who not only respected me but adored me, someone who would flood my life with joy and treat me as the queen I deserve.

Philip  

The engine's rumble filled my ears as I deftly navigated the car around the racetrack. Amidst the engine's roar, my eyes narrowed with frustration, weighed down by my burdens. 
The memory of that fateful night pierced through my mind like a dagger. Sarah knelt before me, her plea for a divorce hanging heavy in the air.  
The agony etched upon her face spoke volumes, her eyes ablaze with a desperate longing for freedom. It was as if the mere thought of remaining bound to me disgusted her to her very core, driving her to her knees in a last-ditch effort to break free from the chains of our crumbling marriage. 
Frustration pulsed through me like a relentless tide. The need to escape overwhelmed me, propelling me to Monaco to immerse myself in the adrenaline of a car race. 
With the signal urging me toward the beckoning "finish" line, my heart raced in anticipation. Behind me, my competitor inched closer, the chase's intensity palpable. With steely determination, I narrowed my eyes, channeling all my focus into that final stretch.  
As I surged forward, it was as though a cyclone of adrenaline propelled me, each passing moment a whirlwind of speed and intensity. I conquered the distance in a blur of motion, crossing the finish line with a triumphant roar, leaving my rival in the dust. 
"And there it is! Philip Cornell, driving car number 5043, crosses the finish line! We have a winner!" 
With a dramatic flourish, I bring the car to a halt and emerge into a blaze of flashing lights from the cameras. The crowd's cheers crescendo around me, filling the air with an electrifying energy. As I stand in the spotlight of victory, the team converges upon me: the engineer, pit crew, spotter, and our esteemed team manager, Orlie, each offering congratulations and admiration for our triumph on the track. 
I felt the persistent pressure of the massage, whoever it may have been, followed by a chorus of "congratulations!"  
For a moment, I set aside my anger and embraced the joy of those relying on me. Car racing fills me with pride. 
"Man! That was insane!" Orlie exclaimed, tapping me on the shoulder. "Why do you seem so pumped? I've never seen you this focused!" 
"I'm mad," I replied. 
"Is it about your parents again?" he inquired. 
I met Orlie when I was fifteen; he's a veteran of the racing world, took me under his wing, and ushered me into the heart of the industry. He's intimately acquainted with the twists and turns of my story. 
With a casual shrug, I brushed off Orlie's inquiry. 
"Then, does it have to do with your wife?" 
My expression soured with concern for Sarah. 
Orlie chuckled, amused by my reaction. I avoided discussing Sarah and instead allowed my victory to amplify my emotions. 
In my suite, I noticed my phone flashing, indicating an incoming call. Glancing to check the caller, I saw it was Jane. Perhaps she'd already spoken to my wife and knew what had happened. 
"Hello?" I answered. 
"Brother! My boyfriend watched the live car race today and mentioned you were in the Monaco race?" my sister inquired. 
"Yes," I confirmed, pouring myself some water and taking a sip. It wasn't news to Jane that racing was my outlet for frustrations from Highland Hills City. 
"Is Sarah with you?" 
I attempted to maintain a casual tone upon hearing Sarah's name. "No, I came to Monaco alone." 
"I've been trying to reach your villa, but no one's picking up. I wanted to ask Sarah if she's considering reapplying to the school here in London. I know you're her husband, but I can't help but feel sorry for her intellect. She turned down the London university offer for me and your marriage." 
I couldn't help but sneer. "She declined school because she preferred living like a princess." 
"Absolutely not! Are you attempting to undermine your wife to me? Sarah is an incredibly talented student, alright? Three years ago, we both applied for an opportunity here in London. She graciously stepped aside to give me the chance, ultimately leading to her marrying you. Anyway, that's one of the reasons I reached out to you. Can you please encourage Sarah to pursue it? She's still young, which would waste her education!" 
I sighed heavily. "We're getting a divorce." 
"What?!" Jane's voice crackled with shock through the phone. "Now it all makes sense. So, that means Sarah left Serenity Pines Estate!" 
My heart clenched painfully in my chest at the revelation. How could Sarah leave Serenity Pines like this without a word to me? I had always assumed she would have the decency to inform me before departing the villa. But now, it hits me like a freight train-she has nowhere else to call home! She has no place to go! 
I refused to entertain the thought of Sarah leaving the villa. My inner voice insisted that she belonged with me and shouldn't go. 
Fvck it! 
"Seriously, what have you done, brother?!" Jane's voice dripped with anger. "Is it about Megan?" 
My expression darkened further. Megan had nothing to do with my marriage! How often had her name come up despite my lack of contact for the past three years? 
"Jane, I have to go. I have a flight to catch," I interjected abruptly. I feared I might unleash all my pent-up frustration on Jane if the conversation persisted. 
I must ensure Sarah is at home.  
Following my tense conversation with Jane, I urgently contacted Alex, who remained in Highland Hills. "Check your Madam Sarah's whereabouts."  
With a sense of urgency, I hastily packed my belongings and notified Orlie that I couldn't attend the victory party as planned due to my urgent return to Highland Hills City. 
I was restless to learn about Sarah's situation after hours of waiting for a response from Alex. 
As the private plane touched down in Highland Hills City, the dawn was breaking, marking the arrival of local morning, and it was then that Alex finally provided an update. 
"Boss, Madam Sarah accompanied Mr. Amir Benner. A camera spotted her with the president of TerraTraxx at the airport last night," Alex informed me. 
My fists involuntarily clenched at the news. 
"Find out their destination," I demanded, my tone edged with frustration. 
"To Dubai, Boss," Alex promptly replied.
###chapter 13: Vanishing Vows 
**Philip**  

"Sarah, get me a drink," I almost blurted out, realizing Sarah wasn't home.  
As I moved through the villa, the silence enveloped me like a heavy blanket. Each step echoed in the emptiness, emphasizing the absence of Sarah's presence. The familiar sight of her lounging on the sofa, which greeted me upon returning home, was notably absent. 
Alone in the quiet villa, a sense of loneliness settled over me like a heavy shroud. With a mixture of frustration and longing, I lowered myself onto the sofa, my hand instinctively curling into a tight fist. The mere notion of Sarah possibly entangled with Amir Benner ignited a fierce surge of anger, stirring my emotions to their core. 
Amidst the silence, a profound emptiness enveloped me, leaving me adrift in a sea of unresolved emotions. 
It was the familiarity of having Sarah around for three years that left me feeling unsettled. Frustration surged through me, prompting me to hurl the glass I had just used for water before storming out of the villa. Opting to spend the night at the office seemed preferable, so I informed Alex of my decision. 
Despite my desire to locate Sarah, the pressing issues at the office prevented me from traveling to Dubai to confront Amir Benner. 
A week later, I observed a new face in the role of secretary. 
"Where is the previous secretary?" I inquired of Alex, my attention drawn to the change as he entered the room, not out of any particular interest in the secretary's presence. 
My assistant explained, "Mr. Williams's wife filed a complaint about her husband's involvement with the secretary. It caused quite a stir while you were away in Monaco, boss." 
Alex mentioned the company's production manager. 
"It turned out that the secretary has been using our credit card for personal expenses," Alex disclosed. "The amounts she's spending are relatively small, so they flew under the radar for a while. However, it ultimately led to her removal from the team and raised complaints within the office." 
I nodded, absorbing Alex's revelation. 
"What about Sarah's whereabouts?" I inquired, simultaneously scanning through some documents. 
Alex scratched his head in uncertainty. "Boss, I'm not entirely sure. I apologize." 
Lowering the document, I made eye contact with Alex, trying to understand what he had just said. It was the first time our team couldn't handle a particular piece of information. 
"What do you mean?" A mix of concern and suspicion crept into my voice, causing my gaze to narrow. 
"Mr. Amir Benner has a penthouse apartment in Dubai, but our investigation found no evidence of a woman living there," Alex explained tentatively. 
"Are you suggesting Sarah is sleeping with him?" I snapped, my frustration evident. 
"N-no, boss! That's not what I meant," Alex hastily clarified, attempting to salvage the situation, but my anger had already ignited. 
"Then why the fvck were you snooping around Mr. Benner's apartment for Sarah?" I demanded, struggling to contain my temper. 
"W-well, there's a possibility, considering Madam Sarah-"  
As Alex attempted to explain, his words were abruptly silenced by the loud crash of a crystalized paperweight hurtling through the air, shattering upon impact with the nearby wall. The sudden eruption of violence jolted Alex, causing him to flinch at the intensity of my outburst visibly. 
"Alex, do you understand where you went wrong?" I asked through clenched teeth. 
"Yes, boss. I apologize. It wasn't very reasonable of me to entertain such thoughts. I only speculated because the last time anyone saw Madam Sarah was at the airport with Mr. Benner. I'm truly sorry. Besides, Mr. Benner is getting married to his long-time girlfriend, Jessica Woods." 
"Keep a close eye on Mr. Amir Benner! And this better be the last time you entertain the idea of Sarah running off with someone else! Also, find out who Sarah was with that man in Serenity Pines on our anniversary night!" 
I was desperate for answers. 
But days stretched into agonizing weeks, each one heavier than the last. Yet, still, there was no trace of Sarah or the mysterious person in the hoodie. It felt like she had been swallowed by the void, disappearing into the ether without a whisper of her whereabouts. 
As weeks bled into months, I abandoned myself to the singular pursuit of claiming the presidency at Luminary Productions. 
The opportunity presented itself, and I fought tooth and nail with fervor. The board, recognizing my drive and competence, granted me the coveted position with my father as a chairman. 
I wondered if Sarah's disappearance had accidentally made things easier for me. Yet, I remained steadfastly focused on work despite my mother's persistent insistence that I reconnect with Megan. 
Then, out of nowhere, I received a divorce decree from the civil court, finalizing the end of my marriage with Sarah. 
What the hell just happened? How did the papers get filed without my knowledge? 
And where the hell is my ex-wife? 
I later discovered that my mother had submitted those papers a day after we signed it! 
*** 
After a year, I seized the opportunity to travel to Dubai.  
Exhausted from the relentless grind of work, I got to partake in the adrenaline-fueled chaos of the GT Racing competition, slated to erupt at the prestigious Dubai Autodrome. 
With excitement rushing through me, I jumped into a fierce competition with many talented people. Winning round after round got me closer to the big showdown: facing off against the winners from earlier battles. 
"It's TerraTraxx Automotive that's footing the bill for this race," Orlie informed me, "and the ultimate victor will serve as the ambassador for their latest sports car model." 
As we entered the dome, three identical cars stood prominently, each in a different hue - yellow, blue, and red. Their polished surfaces sparkled, captivating the attention of everyone present. 
"How much do they cost?" I inquired, eyeing the sleek vehicles. 
"Eight million dollars!" he exclaimed. "Can you believe it? Twenty-four million for a trio of cars purely intended as decorative fixtures for racing events, courtesy of TerraTraxx. Tss!" 
"You fancy one of those?" I teased Orlie, knowing full well that the winner of the race would receive the latest model of the supercar. 
"Absolutely!" Orlie replied eagerly. 
"Well, then consider it yours," I teased him. 
"Talking about money now, huh?" Orlie retorted with a smirk. "It's a whole different ball game when you're wealthy!" 
"You lunatic! You'll be the one left footing the tax bill!" I quipped, chuckling at the thought. 
As the team meticulously scrutinized the car I was slated to drive, I was engrossed in observing the participants on the iPad Orlie lent me. 
Then, out of nowhere, the thunderous roar of engine number 3011 shattered my tranquility. It echoed through the air like a beast unleashed, impossible to disregard. Yet, amidst the cacophony, I couldn't shake the sensation of the driver's piercing gaze boring into me as the vehicle prowled past. 
"Who was that?" I inquired, seeking clarification from Orlie about the driver concealed within the car. 
Orlie quickly checked his phone to cross-reference the participants with the car's number. "Oh, it's Blaze Belle," he responded. "She's also a champion in a second round, who's been absent from the scene for years. Just made a comeback recently." 
"Really? A woman?" I was surprised, recalling the inclusive nature of the current racing tournament. 
"Yeah, it's a mixed-gender event," Orlie confirmed. "Blaze Belle has quite the reputation. I've only seen snippets of her races online since she keeps a low profile." 
"Do you know her personally?" I pressed; my curiosity ablaze. It seemed improbable that Orlie would be acquainted with any racer, particularly considering his earlier remark about the woman's extended absence from the racing scene. 
"Not personally, but she's a formidable competitor," Orlie remarked. "The rumor about her pursuing university studies could be true, considering her low-key presence lately." 
"It means she's young," I muttered. 
"Yeah" Orlie shrugged his shoulders. 
I initially dismissed Blaze Belle as a conversation topic to avoid misunderstandings with Orlie. However, as part of my routine, I took the time to watch her racing video. I needed to understand her techniques and how she navigates the track. 
Blaze Belle's performance was impressive. She flawlessly executed cornering maneuvers, engaging in strategic battles with her competitors and making shrewd decisions during pit stops. Her strategic positioning on the track gave her a significant competitive edge. 
Despite my persistent curiosity, I found no photographs of her on my browsing screen. Glancing in her direction, I noticed her back facing me, obscuring her features yet exuding an undeniable allure. 
A shiver coursed down my spine as I admired the graceful curve of her slender figure, the way her coffee-brown locks cascaded in waves, teasingly brushing against her tiny waist. However, it was the sight of her round, captivating butt that momentarily stole the air from my lungs. 
An unsettling feeling lingered, suggesting her presence was significant beyond this moment's confines. Fortunately, the final tournament is about to start. 
All the participants took their places, and the engines revved up loudly, filling the stands with a powerful sound. The crowd leaned forward eagerly, clearly excited and waiting in anticipation. My vehicle poised at the starting line, eyes fixed on the twisting ribbon of asphalt ahead. 
As the signal blared, a surge of adrenaline propelled me forward, and tires squealed as I fought for position, flirting with danger as my car danced at the edge of control. 
The tournament climaxed as my car and Blaze Belle's went head-to-head in the final stretch, with the checkered flag looming on the horizon. 
An eerie feeling crept over me as my ego surged. I couldn't bear the thought of being beaten by a woman. 
Blaze Belle demonstrated her mastery of cornering techniques, executing late braking maneuvers at the twisting alley. Her swift movements caught me off guard as she surged ahead, leaving me trailing behind by meters.  
However, I was utterly astonished when she intentionally let me pass her just meters away from the finish line, conceding victory. 
Fvck! Fvck! Fvck! Fvck! That woman was playing mind games with me! 
"Ladies and gentlemen, in a thrilling conclusion, car number 1065 has crossed the finish line, clinching victory spectacularly! We have our winner!" 
Even though I emerged victorious in the competition, a sense of dissatisfaction lingered within me. I couldn't shake the realization that Blaze Belle had deliberately let me win the tournament. 
Gritting my teeth, I attempted to exit the car, only to be obstructed by my team and several dome attendees who congratulated me on my triumph. 
But Blaze Belle... Her actions left me with a completely different emotion despite my victory. That woman's audacity knew no bounds. 
As she stepped out of her car, disbelief washed over me as I recognized the familiar figure-it was Sarah!
###chapter 14: Unforeseen Encounters 
**Sarah**  

I smirked as I watched Philip's eyes widen in disbelief, though I allowed indifference to settle within me as we reunited after a year of lost communication. 
With a deft flick, I transferred the car key into the waiting hand of Amir's head secretary, Rey. Philip's stunned expression momentarily froze him in place, delaying his advance towards me. But before he could gather his wits, his team diverted his attention, providing me the perfect opening to vanish into the shadows of departure. 
With determined steps, I made my way toward the dome's exit, the weight of Philip's presence looming behind me like a relentless shadow. We traversed the hallway, a forbidden corridor reserved solely for the elite racers of the day, where only a scattering of staff dared to tread. 
"Sarah!" His voice pierced the air. 
'Sht!' 
Without a backward glance, I instinctively sought refuge in the shadows near the staircase, holding my breath to evade detection. 
"Where the hell is that woman?!" His frustrated expletives echoed against the stairs. 
'That's right! Let frustration consume you,' my inner voice whispered, a smirk dancing across my lips. 
"Philip?" A man's voice, presumably Orlie Petrov, interjected. "What's going on? Why did you leave so suddenly?" 
"It's Sarah! I saw her! She's Blaze Belle!" 
"Sarah?"  
"My wife!"  
'Ex, you fool!' I nearly let out a scream, but I restrained myself, crouching behind the stairs with them just on the other side. 
"Your wife? That's ludicrous, man! Are you sure you're talking about the right person? Isn't she a simple woman? I mentioned earlier that Blaze Bell has been in the industry for years. I thought your wife was uncomplicated. Can she even drive?" Orlie questioned Philip. 
Philip remained silent, his composure intact, though I knew it wouldn't last. Their voices faded into the distance before I emerged from my hiding spot. 
With a frantic pace, I dashed towards the exit gate, where Jakob awaited, his grin visible even from a distance. Without hesitation, I leaped into the passenger seat from outside the car, the wind tousling my hair as I landed gracefully, the open hood of my sports car adding to the dramatic flair of our escape. 
"Let's get out of here!" I urged Jakob, and without hesitation, he ignited the engine, propelling us away from the dome. 
"Tired already? And why did you let your ex-husband win the race?" Jakob inquired. 
"Philip isn't foolish. He knows what I've done." The memory of Philip's handsome visage twisted into a mask of irritation haunting my mind as we drove. 
My fist tightened into a knot of tumultuous emotions, a tempest raging within me. 
I wanted to know if Philip still occupied the same place in my heart, and frustratingly, he still did. I scolded myself for it, the anger at my weakness simmering beneath the surface. Yet, as my enduring affection for him lingered, so did the reservoir of memories that fueled my resentment. 
"Did you know Philip Cornell before you two met and got married?" Jakob's inquiry sliced through the tension like a razor. 
"Yes," I admitted, my voice tinged with a mix of fondness and bitterness. "It's no secret that I have a passion for racing. I first caught sight of him in a magazine when I was just seventeen."  
I can boldly declare that my infatuation with Philip predated our actual encounter, which is precisely why my heart raced like a wild stallion when Jane finally introduced us at the illustrious Cornell Mansion. 
As for Jane, I couldn't shake the sense of longing for her presence. Despite the rift between me and her family, I sorely missed her! While she was upset with me, she empathized with my situation, having her history with Mrs. Cornell, which ultimately led to her leaving Highland Hills City to pursue studies in London.  
Jane's relationship with my mother-in-law is anything but amicable, and I comprehend the reasons all too well.  
Mrs. Cornell is a lunatic, jealous woman! 
"Your husband was oblivious to your enrollment in university, your career as a computer software designer and engineer, and your involvement in racing? Is he an idiot?" Jakob commented.  
No, it just happened that Philip didn't care about me-that's the reason!  
Philip didn't know I was a Benner princess, too, and my life became chaotic with him added to it. If only he had taken the time to care about me truly, he would have comprehended the depths of my existence.  
I attempted to push aside thoughts of Philip and promptly requested Jakob to drive me back to Grandpa Mitchell's mansion. 
"Anyway, I need to inform you that Philip Cornell is our client," Jakob disclosed. 
"What? What do you mean Philip is our client?" I asked, bewildered. Thankfully, Jakob was driving because I would have likely swerved the car in surprise. 
"Do you recall the visual effects tools and application we submitted to BM Technologies three months ago? It turns out Bronn Martin offered the service to Luminary Production. Your ex-husband will be working on an action and sci-fi film. So, he's interested in the bidding that took place," Jakob explained. 
"This could be problematic. But technically, we only created a draft of the tools. Our main focus was on partnering with BM Technologies for the AI dating game app we're designing." 
Three months ago, Jakob and I joined forces with BM Technologies. Freshly graduated, we sought protection from the industry's giants and preferred to keep our identities low-key. BM Technologies offered us the cover of a multi-million-dollar project, allowing us to operate discreetly. 
One of the motivations behind my actions was to evade Philip's detection. Alex leads a competent investigative team. If Philip were to discover my recent activities, it could jeopardize my partnership with Jakob. 
"We have a meeting scheduled with Luminary's production team next month," Jakob announced, his tone carrying a hint of bombshell revelation. 
"You've got to be kidding me!" I retorted incredulously. 
"Not at all. Look, I know Philip Cornell is your ex-husband, but I'm eager to see our work on the big screen, too! Besides, there's substantial potential for us with this project. Aren't you at least a bit excited about what your ex might offer us?" 
While I couldn't deny Jakob's logic, I still felt compelled to argue. "But let's not forget, he once suspected a romantic involvement between us." 
"Are you concerned that your husband-" 
"Ex-husband!" I corrected firmly. 
"Fine, fine! Ex-husband! Are you worried he might believe his suspicions were valid?" 
"Nope. I have no ties with Philip anymore, and I don't care about what he thinks." 
"Feisty!"  
All I could do was frown, wondering what good our skills, Jakob's and mine, were if we ignored the chance Philip had offered us. 
As Jakob's halted my sport's car in front of Grandpa Mitchell's mansion gate, I stepped out. 
"Thanks for the ride!" I said. Despite being the owner of the vehicle, I allowed Jakob to use it, recognizing his significant contribution to my personal growth and development. 
"See you at Henderson!" he yelled back, speeding off. 
"What?!" 
That lunatic! His words would've been lost on me entirely if I hadn't dared to step foot inside the mansion, where Grandpa Mitchell's scowl greeted me, emphasizing my presence in a racing suit, embracing my curve. It was at that moment that I realized he had company in the mansion's expansive living area. 
There stood a tall figure. As he turned, recognition dawned upon me. 
It's Bronn Martin! 
What a coincidence, considering he's the current president of BM Technologies, where I will dedicate my time as a computer graphic engineer. 
But my main question is: Why is my ex-fiancé here? The one who made Grandpa Mitchell upset with me for three whole years! 
"What are you doing here?" I pondered, my mind swirling with thoughts. Had he found out I applied for a job at his company? But all those concerns dissipated when my grandpa clarified Bronn's presence. 
"You're going to resume your marriage with Bronn!" Grandpa Mitchell announced. 
I noticed a smirk on Bronn's face. 
Simultaneously, my phone beeped, and Jakob's message lit up my screen. 
Jakob: Your husband was quick! He's submitted your photos to the police and announced he'd offer five million to whoever brings you to him. Should I send you to him? It's not a small sum (accompanied by a grin emoji.) 
That lunatic!
###chapter 15: Love's Countdown 
**Sarah**  

As I looked at Bronn, a small doubt crept into my thoughts. Could he be the one to make me feel loved and complete? The promise I had silently made to myself, urging me to seek love and companionship.  
But even with these doubts, I felt a strong sense of urgency. Time was slipping away, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that I needed to act quickly amidst the uncertainty that clouded my mind. 
He's thirty-three, the same age as- I must halt my thoughts there! 
I'm seething with frustration! Jakob's text message has triggered my whirlwind of thoughts about my utterly insane ex-husband. 
"Can you at least muster a smile for a moment? Your demeanor is making me feel ancient!" Grandpa Mitchell chastised me as if my usual stoicism was unfamiliar to him. 
"Grandpa, please refrain from scolding Sarah," Bronn interjected. 
My grandpa emitted a frustrated huff. 
"Please disregard Grandpa's earlier comment. I'm here to discuss business and nothing else," Bronn stated. 
"I'll go change my attire," I informed Bronn before turning to Lori, one of my maids, and instructed, "Please escort my guest to the garden area," before making my way to the elevator headed for the third floor, where my room awaited. 
Amanda trailed behind me, relieving me of some personal belongings. However, to my surprise, Grandpa Mitchell also stepped into the lift. 
"Sarah, you know I care for you deeply, right? Why won't you consider my suggestion to marry that young Martin?" Grandpa inquired pointedly, referring to Bronn. 
"Grandpa, Bronn doesn't love me. Like me, he was forced into the arranged marriage you and his grandpa arranged for us. Marriage without love is senseless." 
"And now you're lecturing me? Ha!" He scoffed, crossing his arms. 
With a gentle smile gracing my lips, I leaned softly against one of his arms. In that tender moment, I felt the warmth of Grandpa Mitchell's love enveloping me, melting away his anger like a fleeting breeze in the face of an insurmountable blitz. 
"I just learned from the relationship you and grandmother had. I want to experience love like you gave her," I reasoned. 
Ultimately, he frequently grasped the rationale whenever I invoked the memory of my deceased grandmother. 
"Why don't you try to win Bronn Martin's heart? Make him fall for you. You're a good girl, Sarah. That boy will love you," he commented. 
"Grandpa..." I winced but murmured, "I'll try," hoping to conclude the conversation swiftly. 
Grandpa Mitchell and I parted ways in the hallway before I entered my room while he went to his own. 
I commanded Amanda to get the bath ready for me before I stormed towards one of the cabinets in the wardrobe. 
My chest constricted, suffocating me. With trembling hands, I snatched the medicine bottle from the cabinet after unlocking it with the key. 
Swallowing hard, I popped a pill and marched to the tiny fridge to grab a water bottle. I downed it mercilessly, along with the pill to calm my heart. 
Agonizing emotions overwhelmed me as I glanced at the medicine bottle. Since the loss of my baby with Philip, frequent bouts of chest tightness and breathlessness due to relentless panic attacks have plagued me. Subsequently, the doctor who had been treating me for the past year diagnosed me with heart failure. 
"You only have one year to live, Miss Mitchell," I remembered Dr. Morgan telling me last month. 
I only have one year left in this world with mitral valve regurgitation. 
"If you undergo surgery, it will affect you psychologically, especially since you've gone through maternal and postpartum grief." 
That truth cut deep as I continue to grieve the loss of my unborn child to this day. I refuse to undergo heart surgery, and if this is the fate the Lord has bestowed upon me, I won't resist it. 
My life's sole pursuit is to unearth a man who will love me deeply, treat me with the utmost respect like a queen, and care until the end of my days. 
"Miss, the bath is ready," Amanda's voice brought me back to the present moment. 
After returning the medication to the cabinet and securing it, I proceeded to the bathroom to groom myself before facing Bronn Martin, one of the individuals with the potential to fulfill my ultimate aspiration. 
*** 
"I apologize for any inconvenience with the wait," I said to Bronn as I approached.  
I submerged myself into the depths of the tub, seeking solace in the comforting embrace of warm water, before emerging and donning a somber black dress. Other than the stark contrast of the body racing suit, every thread that adorned my form bore the black hue, a poignant reminder of the profound grief that still gripped me, the loss of my child with Philip. 
Bronn stood up and helped me settle into the chair across from him.  
"No worries. Fortunately, I had my iPad with me. I hardly noticed the time as I was catching up on emails," he replied. 
I noted his busyness and appreciated his effort to come to see me. Lori poured iced tea into a glass and handed it to me.  
"Thank you," I murmured. 
"I adore this mansion!" Bronn exclaimed, but I braced myself against any further effusive praise. 
"What brings you here?" I inquired. 
"Ah, yes! I heard you're involved with LoveLogic, which is currently in partnership with BM Technologies," he said, locking eyes with me, which gave me a slight unease. "I'm interested in becoming a character in that app." 
"What?" I didn't anticipate that suggestion from Bronn. "Bronn, are you seriously considering resorting to a dating app when you still haven't found a girlfriend?" 
"That's amusing, isn't it? But plausible. What do you think?" he taunted, a sly smirk curling at the corner of his lips, betraying his amusement with the unfolding scenario. 
I paused, the weight of his suggestion sinking in before I cautiously retorted, "So, you're proposing this as a means to boost your earnings from the app we're tirelessly developing?" 
"Maybe," he said casually, leaving me slightly taken aback. 
What kind of response was that? Bronn is one of the wealthiest men around, and at the age of thirty-three, he was even more desirable to many women. If he were to join as one of the AI boyfriend characters for LoveLogic, it could undoubtedly attract a larger user base of women. 
He'll bring me and Jakob fortune. 
"But have you considered the potential risks to your reputation and BM Technologies?" I pressed cautiously. 
"It's just an AI boyfriend character. And if my character makes any earnings, I intend to donate to charity. Does that ease your concerns?" he explained. 
I nodded, though uncertainty clouded my thoughts. "Now that you've chosen to be part of the boyfriend characters, my partner and I will begin designing your character for inclusion on the list. I'll send you the contract shortly, in case you know..." To avoid a lawsuit! 
He nodded back. "Oh, and one more thing" 
"What is it now?" 
"When are you going to apologize to me?" 
I nearly choked on my saliva at what I heard. It had been precisely four years since I terminated my marriage agreement with him. To alleviate the constriction in my throat, I reached for the juice Lori had prepared and took a sip. 
"I offer my sincerest apologies. My actions have tarnished the honor of your family and Grandpa Mitchell's. I deeply apologize for the harm I've caused." 
"If you truly regret it, how about a date next weekend at Henderson? Aren't you heading to BM Technology to finalize the design in a month? Let's go on a date!" he suggested eagerly. 
A swirl of emotions churned within me as my gaze met Bronn's. His actions left me puzzled; his intentions shrouded in ambiguity. 
"Are you flirting with me, Mr. Bronn Martin?" I asked, trying to discern his intentions. 
"Did it seem like I was flirting with you?" he countered with a smirk. 
A surge of intrigue coursed through me. With Bronn unexpectedly offering himself, I couldn't help but ponder that he might be one of the few who could harbor genuine affection for me. 
Am I being selfish in considering what I'm about to do?  
All I desire is to understand the feeling of being loved before my time here concludes. Bronn is one of the potential candidates for this experience. Furthermore, if Bronn loves and marries me, it will fulfill Grandpa Mitchell's longstanding wish for me to wed this man. 
"Agreed," I affirmed, masking any emotions with a stoic expression, concluding our conversation. 
A week later, as fate would have it, I found myself back in Henderson, where Bronn's office resided.  
However, what truly caught me off guard was seeing Philip alongside Megan.
###chapter 16: Fragile Heart 
**Sarah**  

Two distinct objectives drove my journey to Henderson. Firstly, to advance our thriving partnership with BM Technologies. Secondly, to partake in the jubilant festivities marking Amir's engagement. 
Jessica's family lives in Henderson. Months ago, they had arranged their wedding, but the bitch encountered an issue with her cosmetic surgery. After meeting her in Dubai, she decided to undergo a Brazilian butt lift surgery and a breast augmentation to achieve the hourglass figure she desired for her wedding photos. However, her recovery didn't proceed as smoothly as expected. 
Concerned about looking foolish in the wedding photos, Jessica decided to postpone the wedding for another year. 
Lost in concentration in the room provided by BM Technologies for myself and Jakob, I hardly noticed the passing time as my fingers flew across the keyboard, applying the application codes to the platform. I must complete this task as soon as possible. 
Suddenly, a knock on my desk interrupted my focus, and I looked up to see Bronn standing there. 
"It's eight already," he said. "My secretary was spot on when she mentioned you were still here. If you end up getting sick, I don't want any trouble with Grandpa Mitchell or your family." 
As the last lines of code seamlessly integrated into the platform, a sense of accomplishment washed over me. I closed my laptop, stretched my limbs, and then rose from my chair holding it.  
"Interesting... I heard rumors about you being a demon in the office, but it seems I've been mistaken," I remarked. 
"I am, but our history complicates things. You're... different," he admitted. 
"I'd rather not give anyone the impression that I used connections to get here. So, if possible, let's steer clear of that topic," I requested, noticing Jakob's absence from the room. "I'll head back to the hotel," I added. 
"Why not stay at the Martin mansion?" he suggested. 
"You're funny!" I said nonchalantly, not eager to stay at my ex's place. "Anyway, the Airbnb apartment nearby is available now for convenience. I'll be moving tomorrow afternoon," I informed, not wanting to raise eyebrows among BM Technologies' staff for staying at a luxury hotel. 
"Great! Just give me a heads-up if you need anything. Come on, let's grab a bite to eat! I've booked a table at the Hilton Lake Resort for dinner," he proposed. 
"Hmm... So, you did your homework. You already know that's where I'm staying," I observed. 
I accepted the invitation, preferring to keep things casual with Bronn, especially considering the possibility of a second shot at love. Additionally, it was nearly time for me to take my medication. 
"Hey, there's something else I need to discuss with you," I interjected. 
As we made our way down the hallway, I couldn't help but sense the weight of curious eyes following our every move. Passersby shot us questioning looks, their raised eyebrows silently probing as we traversed the corridor.  
The two women in the lobby added to the scrutiny, their lingering gazes intensifying the feeling of being under observation.  
Bronn guided me into his sleek Audi R8, and I couldn't shake the feeling that the onlookers we passed were covertly admiring us. 
"What's on your mind?" he inquired as we cruised down the street. 
"I have a couple of requests. First off, I'd prefer it if your office remained unaware of any past relationship between us. I'm using the name Sarah Mitchell, not Sarah Benner, to avoid any implications that I leveraged connections for the partnership with BM Technologies to assist Jakob and me with LoveLogic." 
"No problem," Bronn responded succinctly. 
"Secondly, Jakob and I intentionally applied under different identities as part of your development and graphic design team. This decision ties back to my initial request. If LoveLogic gets launched, I'd prefer not to be identified as one of the developers. Sarah Benner values her privacy. I prefer not to get public attention as the princess of the Benners." 
Especially the thought of my disappearance from this world. The aftermath would undoubtedly wreak havoc on my family and Jakob. I couldn't help but imagine the scathing speculations that would flood the news blogs, tearing apart every aspect of my existence. 
A tightness gripped my chest, suffocating me momentarily. Seeking the medicine, I reached for one pill from the pouch, popping it into my mouth to quell the rising turmoil within. I thought I had masked my distress well, but Bronn's keen observation caught me off guard. 
"What's that?" he inquired, his gaze fixed on the pouch in my hand. 
"Oh, just vitamins," I replied with a forced nonchalance, concealing the ache in my chest. 
Bronn offered me a bottle of water, a gesture that surprised me. 
"Thanks!" I muttered, accepting it gratefully. 
"You won't have any issues with me," he reassured, addressing the concerns I had voiced earlier. "Anyway, how's the project progressing with Jakob?" 
"We've completed the design and tackled several crucial aspects for LoveLogic," I explained. "Jakob had already laid much of the groundwork before I joined your office, so I'm currently playing catch-up on the coding front. At the moment, we're focused on implementing and refining the codes for both iOS and Android platforms. That's what I was engrossed in before you interrupted," I explained. 
His car glided to a halt at the hotel entrance, where we received a warm personal welcome from the hotel manager. The Martins, a prominent family in the city, were well-known, so the anticipation of our arrival was palpable, especially since the restaurant had reserved a table for us. 
Soft jazz melodies wafted through the air, mingling with the alluring scent of gourmet cuisine. The ambiance, characterized by shimmering chandeliers and plush velvet furnishings, captivated my senses. 
Bronn graciously assisted me to our reserved seats.  
"Would you care for some wine, Miss Mitchell?" the hotel manager inquired. 
"No, thank you," I replied, mindful of my heart condition. 
Soon, our evening meal was being prepared, featuring an array of Southern dishes. However, I knew they weren't ideal for my health, such as buffalo wings. 
"Could I possibly order a Mediterranean salad?" I asked Bronn tentatively. 
"Of course," he replied, discerning my lack of enthusiasm towards the food. 
"Thank you," I responded. 
"I'll inform the kitchen, ma'am," the manager said, attentive to my request. 
"I didn't know you were on a diet. Aren't these your favorites?" Bronn said, motioning towards the food spread on the table. 
Right! I see what he means. These are indeed my favorites. "I still enjoy them. I just felt like incorporating more vegetables into my diet," I explained, attempting to rationalize my choice. 
I suppose a little indulgence wouldn't hurt.  
"By the way, I remembered our earlier conversation. Wouldn't you like to inform my associates that you're one of the developers and graphic designers of LoveLogic?" Bronn asked. 
"Yeah, you're right," I conceded. 
"And what would your role be in that cramped office?" Bronn inquired, nodding towards the small room Jakob and I shared. 
"I'd be Jakob's secretary," I replied. 
Bronn's amusement was evident. "You've been entertaining me all evening, Miss Mitchell. It's a shame our marriage didn't happen. You would have made the perfect wife, you know?" 
I shrugged, enjoying the easy banter between us. There was something comforting about our casual relationship. Perhaps Bronn would be the second person to love me truly. 
"Mr. Martin! What a pleasant surprise to see you here!" a voice exclaimed from behind me. 
My neck went cold, and I nearly dropped the spoon at the sound of Philip's voice. 
"Oh, Mr. Cornell!" Bronn's voice rang out as he stood up from his seat, extending his hand to greet Philip. 
My attention drifted sideways, my eyes locked with my ex-husband, accompanied by Megan, her grip tight around his arm. 
"Sarah? What a coincidence!" Megan's cheerfulness rang hollow, but her smile didn't seem genuine, and I noticed her smirk. 
"Do you two know each other?" Bronn inquired. 
"I was Jane Cornell's college classmate, Mr. Cornell's sister," I replied tersely, determined not to let Philip disrupt my world now. 
Suddenly, the image of my deceased baby flashed before my eyes, and I struggled to catch my breath, instinctively clutching my chest.  
Damn it! I can't let this overwhelm me now! 
"Are you alright, Sarah?" Bronn's concern brought me back to the present. 
I composed myself, taking a sip of water to steady my nerves. I couldn't afford to embarrass myself in front of the trio. 
"Y-yes. I..." My gaze collided with Philip's, his eyes narrowing in a judgmental glare. "I think something I ate didn't sit well. I'll excuse myself to the restroom." 
"Sure!" 
'Ahhh! Sht!' Pain seared through my chest. I need to take my medication and regain composure. 
Rushing into the restroom, I grabbed a pill from my bag, ingested it, and concentrated on soothing my frazzled nerves. I cannot afford to cut short the time allotted by my doctor and must maintain my composure.  
Within minutes, the door abruptly opened, and much to my dismay, Philip appeared-an individual I had hoped to avoid encountering while I leaned against the wall. 
The imbecile! He locked the door, leaving me confined in this expansive ladies' room with him.
###chapter 17: Inferno Within 
**Philip**  

Sarah, my ex-wife, is now entangled with Bronn Martin. From Amir Benner to a computer software developer, she seems to have a penchant for wealthy men, a fact that stirs a deep-seated fury within me. 
She still retains a youthful allure, with her sophisticated, wavy brown hair cascading down her back. It struck me that she is now twenty-three, no longer the young teenager who once stood beside me in marriage. Her skin seemed to radiate under the gentle washroom lighting, and she was draped in a seductive dark dress that tempted sinful thoughts. 
"I've been trying to locate you for a year. After hiding away in Dubai, I never anticipated finding you here. I even resorted to financial means, yet received no leads. Are you growing weary of Amir Benner now that he's set to marry, thus turning your attention to Bronn Martin?" I questioned sharply. 
Sarah's expression remained impassive as she washed her hands, her response devoid of emotion. "I no longer have ties to you, Mr. Cornell. There's nothing I recall needing to discuss or explain." 
Fury ignited within me, propelling me forward as I closed the distance between us. With a forceful grip, I seized her chin, commanding her attention, and pressed her back against the sink. A torrent of desire surged through my veins, an unstoppable wave crashing against my senses. 
"Have I not made it clear, Sarah, that you are mine?" I murmured. I could already feel the softness of her plump lips against mine, her piercing gray gaze locked onto me with unwavering intensity. 
Sarah arched her eyebrow at the remark, her tone tinged with skepticism. "Are you finished with your jokes?" 
"What?" I replied. 
"Mr. Cornell, you don't have ownership over me, and whoever I choose to be with is none of your business. Whatever was between us is over." 
Her rationale struck me like a lightning bolt in a storm, sending shockwaves of frustration rippling through my core. I hadn't considered the possibility of losing her, nor did I anticipate the sting of her words. 
The mere thought of her in Bronn Martin's arms set ablaze a tempest of fury within me. With eyes tightly shut, I drew a deep breath, drinking in the fragrance of her neck that I grasped firmly, yet finding myself shivering at the familiarity of it. 
"You belong to me, Sarah. You shouldn't let other men lay their hands on you!" I claimed, sinking my teeth into her skin to leave a mark before soothing it with my tongue. 
"Let me go!" she hissed, struggling against my grasp. 
But I refused. Instead, I seized her lips forcefully! In that electrifying moment, it felt as if every ounce of longing I had harbored for so long was unleashed, flooding my senses with a hunger I could barely contain. 
Though my desire to claim her then and there was overwhelming, I was forced to restrain myself, unwilling to hurt her in the process. 
She remained still after her struggle, no longer the Sarah I once knew-the Sarah etched in my memory. I paused, halting my advance to kiss her; instead, I locked my eyes with her as our heated breaths mingled in the air.  
"Are you done?" She coolly brushed her fingertips across her lips. "Mr. Philip Cornell, I know you're h0rny, but it seems you've forgotten that our marriage is over." 
A sly grin curled upon my lips. Pressing my body against hers, I felt my hardened groin, yearning for the touch of her pvssy beneath the fabric. Damn it! Perhaps my yearning for Sarah had intensified during her year-long absence. 
I yearned for her with an insatiable hunger before, that craving has transformed into an inferno of desire, raging fiercely within me, burning brighter with each passing moment. 
"A mere dissolution of marriage doesn't even bother me. It's just a piece of shit! So, you must remember this, babe. You. Belong. To me!" I growled each fvcking word, gripping her chin firmly.  
I made sure she understood every word I said! Sarah used to be a submissive wife, and I still expected her to submit to my words.   
To my dismay, she sneered, brushing off invisible dirt from my shoulder before retorting, "I never took you for a whiner like a baby, Philip. I won't apologize for owning my body! My body, my rules!" 
With a forceful shove and a disdainful sneer, she propelled me backward, her eyes blazing with defiance as she strolled towards the door.  
My senses reeled in disbelief, a tempest of fury rising within me as I stood there, abandoned and seething with rage! 
That must be the real her, without a doubt! She discarded her mask, revealing her true self. Unsure whether I appreciate it or not, but the mere thought of her in the arms of another man ignites a fury within me. 
Dialing Alex's number, I implored, "Sarah is here in Henderson! Get every detail on her whereabouts, Alex. I don't want any more mistakes!" 
"Consider it done, boss!" came Alex's prompt reply. 
After regaining composure, I returned to the restaurant table to find Megan already seated with Sarah and Bronn Martin. 
"Philip, I'm sorry. While you were in the washroom, I agreed to join Mr. Martin's table," Megan said with a smile. 
Settling beside Megan and Sarah at the circular table, I observed Sarah's stoic demeanor as she continued to dine. 
"It's good to see you here in Nevada, Mr. Cornell," Bronn commented. 
"We're in town for Amir Benner's engagement and wedding, along with other business projects and events. I've also been considering a visit to BM Technologies," I replied, the last part a spontaneous fabrication. In truth, I harbored a strong curiosity about Sarah's involvement at Bronn's office. 
"You're invited to Amir's wedding, too?" Sarah inquired. 
'Amir?' The inflection in her voice when she uttered that man's name carried a personal touch grated against my very soul. 
Curious about Sarah's attendance at Amir's wedding, I accepted the invitation on behalf of Luminary Productions. 
"It seems we'll be crossing paths again at the engagement. Sarah and I will be attending," Bronn declared, his dazzling smile revealing teeth so perfect they seemed sculpted. At the same time, admiration danced in his eyes like sparkling stars for Sarah. 
I clenched my fist. I didn't want to stir up trouble with Bronn, particularly since I required his help with the production I was organizing. 
"So, will you two be having a date at the wedding as well? And how did you and Sarah meet, Mr. Martin?" Megan inquired. 
Sarah lifted her gaze. "I'm Jakob's secretary, one of his game and security software engineers." 
"Ah, interesting! It seems you're surrounded by men, Sarah. Maybe you'll find a new beau at BM Technologies," Megan teased. 
For the first time, Sarah's lips curved into a smile. "Do you think so?" 
"Yeah, did you try to seduce Mr. Martin, too?" Megan asked bluntly. "Oops, sorry! Sometimes, my tongue gets a little too sharp. I just thought of it because Mr. Martin seems to be quite wealthy and picky."  
Megan's implication was clear: Sarah was targeting wealthy men. 
Despite her seemingly insulting remark, Sarah maintained her polished smile, giving the impression that she was unfazed. It appeared as though she wanted to challenge Megan. Yet, it was actually me who felt my blood boiling as I began to realize there might be something between the two of them. 
I shot Megan a warning glance instead. 
In an attempt to release the tension that had been building in my clenched hands, I reached for my wine glass, taking a sip of the crimson liquid. 
"It's quite the contrary, Ms. Megan," Bronn clarified. "If that's the insinuation, it's actually Ms. Mitchell whom I'm endeavoring to win over. She's stunning and intelligent. Perhaps my years of singleness have led me to this realization. Maybe she's destined to be my wife." 
As I felt my anger simmering beneath the surface, I distracted myself by placing some chicken wings on Sarah's plate. 
"Eat more," I encouraged her, noticing she had been sticking to salad despite the variety of dishes available. After sharing three years of intimacy, I've become intimately familiar with Sarah's body, and I couldn't help but notice the subtle shifts. 
"Thank you," Sarah murmured, accepting the gesture. 
Megan's expression soured while Bronn furrowed his brows, clearly intrigued by my actions. 
"Thanks for the gesture, Mr. Cornell. You must have a good relationship with Sarah," Bronn commented. 
"He's probably just concerned because I'm Jane's best friend," Sarah replied before turning to me. "Anyway, Brother Philip, others might mistake me for your date. Aren't you going to offer Megan some chicken wings, too? It's best not to make her jealous, especially when there's no reason for it. Megan, don't worry, as Jane's brother, Philip is firmly off my prospective lover's list." 
"You have a list?" I exclaimed, feeling my anger flare. Sarah's words were like a lit match to gasoline. I could feel the urge to bite back at her sharp tongue. 
"Brother Philip, it's just a joke. I wouldn't want Mr. Martin thinking I actually keep a list of prospective lovers," she said with a smile directed at him. 
Megan glanced at me, sensing my irritation, and her eyes started to well up with tears. 
I rose from my seat. "I believe Megan has lost her appetite. We'll be heading out." Retrieving some bills from my wallet, I placed them on the table. "Here's our portion of the bill." 
Sarah's comment cut through the air. "Why not grab some takeout, Brother Philip? You've already covered your part of the meal."  
Leaning in closely to Sarah, I made sure my words were delivered in a gentle whisper. "If there's anything I'd like to 'take out,' it's certainly not the food, babe! So, perhaps reconsider your suggestion!"
###chapter 18: Betrayal in Pixels 
**Sarah** 

I'm seething at Philip's remarks, clenching my fist in frustration. The audacity of this despicable man! 
Despite being with Megan, he had the nerve to disrespect me, shamelessly stealing a kiss.  
I despise this tumultuous storm raging within me! The longing persists! The mere touch of Philip's breath, the tender caress of his fingers upon the wineglass, every fleeting glance sends shockwaves through my very essence, threatening to unravel me completely! 
Yet, I must remind myself of the pain he caused, both to me and our child. I must replace any lingering affection with seething anger. 
"Are you alright, Sarah?" Bronn's concerned voice breaks through my thoughts as we leave the restaurant. 
"I'm fine. I'll head back to the suite. See you tomorrow," I reply, masking my turmoil. 
Philip and Megan exit ahead of us in a whirlwind of tension, with Megan practically throwing a tantrum. The sight of her jealousy and irritation ignites a wicked pleasure within me, especially when she can't accept Bronn's interest in me. 
With emotions swirling inside me, I strode purposefully toward the opulent suite I had meticulously secured for three days. The taste of regret lingered on my tongue, a bitter reminder of the unpleasant fare I had ingested earlier, threatening to wreak havoc on my well-being. Sensing the situation's urgency, I knew that only through exercise could I purge my body. 
I already discussed it with my doctor because I find it peculiar how much more invigorated I feel with regular activities. 
The doctor's voice echoed in my mind as I recalled our conversation.  
"Regular exercise can strengthen your heart muscles and improve cardiovascular function. But be careful not to overdo it or disrupt your routine. Since you've already consulted me, make sure not to skip it," the doctor advised. 
He emphasized that my situation was unique and stressed the importance of not neglecting medication. 
The next day at BM Technologies followed its usual course. Philip arrived in the afternoon, just as Jakob and I were deeply engrossed in our job inside the small office. Our focus was disrupted when the secretary interrupted us to remind us about the presentation for Philip's team. 
"Jakob, Luminary Productions is here. The boss is calling you to the conference room. The presentation begins in thirty minutes," Gayla, one of Bronn's secretaries, informed us before leaving again. 
I turned to Jakob. "Are you confident about Luminary?" 
"Yeah, why?" he responded, briefly glancing at me before returning his focus to his laptop screen. 
"Would you stay in Highland Hills City if your project gets accepted? Are you prepared for that?" I inquired. 
"Me? You mean you're not coming with me?" he countered. 
I fell silent momentarily, remembering Jakob's aspirations of joining Philip's Sci-fi project; a chilling question gripped my mind like icy tendrils: Was I inadvertently poised to snatch his dream away? 
I knew deep down that Jakob's dream would come true, but there was a tough reality: I might miss seeing it happen if it didn't happen within a year. 
"I'll stick by you, even if it feels impossible for me to return there."  
The mention of Highland Hills evoked a flood of painful memories, making it the last place I wanted to revisit. 
"But doesn't Philip Cornell realize you're my assistant or secretary?" Jakob queried, his hand finding its way to his chin in contemplation. "It would undoubtedly raise significant questions if he doesn't see us together." 
Shrugging slightly, I confessed, "I can't say for certain what's going through his mind, especially given his role in orchestrating my cheating incident that night." 
After Jacob delved into last year's events, he uncovered unsettling truths. The individual I encountered in the bedroom at Serenity Pines Estate was affiliated with Philip's company and not a recognized actor. Following the ordeal, that actor received a hefty sum of two million from the Cornells. It became evident that Philip was determined to extricate himself from our marriage in favor of Megan. 
Jacob's countenance soured as he broached the sensitive topic. "I apologize for reopening old wounds," he said solemnly. "So, does this mean that now that we're collaborating, Philip might go to great lengths to thwart our efforts in advancing the graphic design tool?" 
"That's how it is," I affirmed frankly. "This is personal, and Philip is our client. He's capable of just about anything," I remarked nonchalantly. 
After that, Jakob and I prepared before going to the conference room. BM Technologies had arranged the attendees into five groups, with Jakob and I among them.  
As we entered, I caught Philip's gaze. Megan accompanied him, managing a smirk and subtly raising her lips in my direction. Without much ado, I ascended the stairs situated to the side. Our seats, alongside Jakob's, were on elevated chairs, typical of the panel conference room where the presentation was slated. 
Philip took the stage and delivered a message. "This project holds immense significance for my company. We will offer a substantial amount along with a bonus to the visual effects developer"  
He offered some words of encouragement before proceeding to call the teams up one by one. Jakob and I found ourselves at the tail end of the list. It was only when the third team was summoned that we encountered an issue. 
They presented their project on the screen. "Meet 'HoloForge,' the latest and greatest software for making sci-fi movies. It's super easy to use, with a cool interface that listens to your voice and gestures, and artists can seamlessly navigate through a vast array of tools and effects, unleashing their imagination without constraints..." 
"Wait a moment!" I exclaimed, rising from my seat and widening my eyes. I shared a glance with Jakob, who mirrored my expression despite the dimness of our surroundings. We were bathed only in the light from the stage and screen. 
Holoforge is ChronoGrafix-our project!  
They've simply rebranded it, but the concept Jakob and I crafted is displayed on the screen! The graphic artist elaborated, "This tool facilitates real-time collaboration among artists, directors, and producers from any corner of the globe. Whether brainstorming ideas, reviewing concept art, or providing feedback on visual effects, every team member can seamlessly contribute to the creative process" 
Uncertainty gripped me as I pondered Jakob's next move. He soured as he realized that someone had usurped our concept. With determined strides, Jakob made his way towards the stage, and I followed suit. 
Panic surged within me. Perhaps I was the true target of the Luminary, and Jakob was unwittingly entangled in the web, just as I had feared earlier.  
Could Philip's presence here signify an attempt to discredit us, branding us as lacking originality and jeopardizing our standing within BM Technologies? 
Feeling frustrated, I grabbed the microphone from Jakob just as he was about to speak and turned it off. 
"Jakob, hold on!" I intervened. 
"Sarah, that project belongs to us!" 
"I'm aware. But we've only been with BM Technologies for three months! Mr. Martin would face humiliation in front of the Luminary, and LoveLogic could suffer repercussions too!" I implored, trying to reason with him. 
"We've exerted tremendous effort on this project! We spent countless nights working, often skipping meals to meet deadlines. And let's not forget you've-" 
"Stop! I'll ask Bronn to conduct an investigation," I interjected calmly. "I understand the frustration of seeing others claim credit for our work, but reacting impulsively to this event could harm us. They're baiting us to react. We need to maintain our professionalism. BM Technologies has a reputation to uphold. If we lose our composure, it could portray us as troublemakers, complicating the resolution process." 
"What should we do then?" Jakob inquired. 
Gayla interrupted us as she approached. "Is there an issue? Why are you here?" 
"Gayla, HoloForge is ChronoGrafix-our project," Jakob explained, his voice shaky. 
"Are you certain?" Gayla's eyes widened in surprise. 
"We need to inform Mr. Martin immediately. The ChronoGrafix shouldn't be displayed," I urged. 
With a sense of urgency, Gayla darted away from us, her steps quick and purposeful as she made a beeline toward Bronn's location. As the third group concluded their presentation, she arrived just in the nick of time, tension thick in the air like an impending storm. Lucas and Stella, with haughty arrogance, descended from the stage, their sneers cutting through the room like blades.  
And then there was Megan, her gaze briefly flickering our way, a chilling void of emotion in her eyes, betraying no hint of sympathy or solidarity. 
'So, it's you!'  
Suppose Megan and Philip intend to undermine me. In that case, I won't let them involve Jakob, who diligently focuses on his work. 
As we were called onto the grand stage for our momentous presentation, Jakob stood frozen, his mind a tumultuous sea of confusion. He had been poured into serving our business partner with BM, and the repercussions of this turmoil were palpable-I could sense his profound distress echoing through the air. 
"I hereby announce a change in the submitted graphic tool!" I proclaimed into the microphone, fixing Megan with a steely gaze. 
Though she hungers for my failure, I am resolved not to yield her the pleasure...
###chapter 19: Behind the Code 
**Sarah**  

I've been considering since earlier that we shouldn't run into any problems with BM Technologies, but it didn't make sense if Megan wanted to undermine both Jakob and me. What I really need to contemplate is who's orchestrating all of this. 
A figure rose from among Philip's team, wearing a plain button-up shirt. Without hesitation, he voiced, "Isn't this strategy you're proposing considered cheating? Are you intending to replace the tool initially selected by Luminary Productions?" 
"Selected?" I echoed his words. 
"Yes, just so you're aware, I'm the project manager for this movie project. I'm intimately familiar with the process, having been involved in the selection of the five options. President Cornell entrusted me with this project, and naturally, I prefer to avoid any potential embarrassment." 
A smirk formed at the corner of my lips. "In that case, may I inquire when the Holoforge was selected?" 
He glanced briefly at Megan, his tone tinged with annoyance as he retorted, "Why should I disclose that information to you? It's a managerial decision! That's confidential within the Luminary Productions team, understood?! Haiist! Why are you putting me on the spot in front of my boss?" 
"I apologize! If it's settled, we can proceed with the presentation featuring ChronoGrafix," I said. 
"Sarah!" Jakob's voice quivered with apprehension. 
"These kids! They're just being annoying!" exclaimed the project manager. 
"Trust me." As I reached out to give Jakob a friendly pat on the shoulder, a sudden chill shot down my spine like an icy arrow.  
My senses heightened as I became aware of Philip's intense gaze fixated on us, his eyes narrowed with suspicion, especially aimed at my hand resting innocently on Jakob's shoulder. It was as if I had unwittingly touched a searing flame; I recoiled instinctively, withdrawing my hand as though scalded. 
What's wrong with that man?! 
The ChronoGrafix presentation began to display on the screen, drawing gasps from those in the conference room. 
"This is ChronoGrafix, a visual effects tool that Mr. Jakob created six months ago," I started. 
"Hold on a minute! Isn't that also the Holoforge?! Damn it! I knew you two were deceivers. You've copied the tool from Lucas and Stella, who presented earlier!" Ethan Steele complained. "Boss, we can't allow these two to deceive us like this! Mr. Martin, are you okay with having these kinds of people in your office?" He scratched his head in frustration. 
Jakob clenched his fists, ready to confront Ethan, but I intervened. I whispered to Jakob, calming him down and advising him on how to clear our names. 
His expression shifted as he absorbed my suggestion, and then he diverted his attention to the iPad he was holding. 
"Mr. Ethan Steele, you mentioned earlier that Mr. Cornell assigned you to this project, correct?" I confirmed. 
"Indeed! That's precisely why I assert that both of you are deceivers! You've merely replicated Lucas and Stella's project!" 
"In that case, my question is, amidst the five tools being presented now, how did it escape your notice that there is a similar tool and presentation? We are the finalists-indicating that these five tools have already undergone scrutiny to align with Luminary Production's preferences," I clarified. 
"Exactly!"  
"Ms. Sarah makes a valid point!"  
Whispers rippled through the graphic designers inside the room. 
"I simply overlooked it, but now I've just realized! How is it that you seem more informed than me? Tsk! Step down there so you can see what you two are searching for! This is exasperating!" He directed his frustration towards Bronn Martin, who sat quietly but with a subtle smirk, seemingly studying my approach to the situation. "Mr. Martin, I've heard that these two are newcomers to your company! Do you approve of stealing concepts at BM Technologies? Tsk! It would be best if you two stepped onto the stage because we don't have time for you!" 
Continuing my explanation, I added, "We will ascertain the truth! BM Technologies dispatched various trial tools to Luminary Productions so they could assess the free versions beforehand-that's why we're here. Earlier, I inquired about the inclusion of Holoforge in the list. How can we be certain that it wasn't Holoforge that copied from ChronoGrafix?" 
They presented Holoforge before ChronoGrafix in the sequence of presentations to create the illusion that the tool is original compared to ChronoGrafix. It's easy to assume that the subsequent tool copied the first one presented. 
"We've been with the company for quite some time! Three years at BM Technologies, to be exact! And you," Lucas countered, gesturing towards the newcomer, "you've only been here for three months! It's only natural that we have more experience." 
Ethan Steele chimed in, his tone laced with anger. "Exactly! Jakob's practically a stranger in this industry. How can we be certain he didn't just lift ChronoGrafix from Lucas's Holoforge?" 
I met Ethan's accusation with a steady gaze. "Is that so? Well, there's encryption in the ChronoGrafix trial that only Jakob can decipher. It includes the entire history of the tool: usage frequency, specific features utilized, and even recipient details. So, Mr. Steele, are you absolutely certain you didn't forward it to Lucas and Stella? Perhaps they can replicate Jakob's hard work?" 
I couldn't fathom any other motive behind such actions. 
Ethan protested, "But retrieving all that information is illegal!" 
"Mr. Steele, there's a terms and conditions acceptance box you have to tick before even accessing the tool. By proceeding, you're essentially agreeing to abide by the rules. Unless, of course, you simply clicked 'agree' without bothering to read them," I countered. 
Philip's expression soured. 
"He sent it to Lucas's email address!" Jakob exclaimed, his eyes widening as he peered at the iPad in his hands. "And it was sent last night!" 
"So, we could assume that Mr. Steele altered Lucas and Stella's proposal project last night!" I asserted. 
"I need to speak!" Lucas rose nervously, repeatedly bowing to apologize. He seemed cornered, with no choice but to confess. "Mr. Martin, I'm sorry! I received an anonymous message last night suggesting that Jakob's graphic tool had a better chance of being included in their project! I-I" He stumbled over his words. "They assured me I wouldn't get caught! I-I was just dazzled because I really wanted to work at Luminary. I'm sorry!" 
Bronn's bodyguards approached, escorting Lucas out of the conference. Stella trailed after them in tears. I could see the bleak future ahead for both Lucas and Stella within BM Technologies. 
Philip stood up. "We have heard enough. Mr. Martin, my apologies." 
"M-Mr. President!" Mr. Steele interjected. "I-I must confess! It's Ms. Megan! She discovered the presentation process today and insisted on excluding Mr. Jakob from the project! I simply followed her lead!" 
Megan's face contorted in a theatrical display of shock, her eyes widening in disbelief. "What? Philip, that's absurd! I'm a major sponsor of this project! Why would I sabotage something I'm funding myself?" Megan argued. "Don't let him disrespect me like this!" 
Megan made a valid point, yet within the depths of her seemingly innocent demeanor, the subtle curve of her smile, the nonchalant flicker of her reactions, and the insidious undertones of her gaslighting tactics, I know the truth. 
Philip's smile, brimming with trust toward Megan, made me sick to my stomach! Is he the mastermind behind all this, or does he just have a weakness for Megan, as usual? It only intensified the ache in my chest. 
I feel like I'm suffocating once more, and it's definitely time for my medication! The memory of Megan's unsettling smile on the day I woke up in the hospital floods my mind. 
"Jake, I-I need to excuse myself to the ladies' room!" I muster a strained smile, hoping to conceal the tightening grip around my chest. 
Damn it! I have to get back to our office immediately and drink my medicine! 
My vision began to blur, the edges fading into darkness, while my hand clutched my chest with an intensity that matched the pounding of my heart.  
I... I couldn't afford to black out now! Not with Philip and everyone watching.
###chapter 20: Sensory Symphony 
**Sarah**   
My breaths came in shallow gasps, struggling to fill my lungs.  
Why did I leave my medication in my bag? Regret gnawed at me as I entrusted everything to Jakob and silently made my way to our office to retrieve my medicine bottle. Taking a moment to steady myself, I acknowledged the need for a consultation back in Dubai. The tightness in my chest had become alarmingly frequent since last night.  
Gathering my composure, I proceeded down the corridor leading to the restroom. As I walked, muffled voices reached my ears, drawing my attention. Peering behind the corner, I observed Megan and Mr. Steele deep in conversation, their tones subdued as if trying to conceal their words from prying ears.  
"Ms. Megan, what about my job? I'm certain Boss Philip will remove me from the project," Ethan Steele's voice trembled with emotion.  
I became increasingly convinced that they were conspiring!  
The project manager added, "You told me this was a directive from Boss Philip, so I trusted you! Why is he suddenly threatening to terminate my employment?"   
My gaze narrowed in response to what I had just heard. Did this imply that Philip was completely unaware? My mind instinctively wanted to challenge that notion.  
With a forceful shove, Megan addressed the man, her tone accusatory. "Why drag me into this mess? And let's not forget, it's all Sarah Mitchell's fault! If you find yourself out of a job, point the finger at her for sticking her nose to the drama! She's merely Jakob's secretary; she has no place meddling in our affairs! You solely acted out of your desire to help your nephew, Lucas..."  
Well, it turns out Lucas and the project manager are acquainted. Tsk!  
That woman! I was desperately seeking to unravel the mystery of her true identity. She leaned in, her words a mere whisper to the project manager, shrouded in secrecy, slipping through my grasp like smoke in the wind.  
"What are you sneaking a peek at?" A hot, whispering breath caressed the nape of my neck, igniting a cascade of tingles down my spine, each like a spark in the dark, setting my nerves ablaze.  
I nearly jumped out of my skin, especially when Megan glanced in the direction of the hallway corner where I was concealed. I doubted Philip overheard Ethan Steele and Megan arguing.  
With urgency coursing through my veins, I grabbed Philip, ensuring Megan was unaware of my eavesdropping. My main goal is to figure out what she wants. 
I hurriedly ushered him into the cramped storage room filled with cleaning supplies; it was the only place I could think of. I could hear Megan's stilettos clicking closer.  
Without hesitation, I shut the door, trapping Philip and me inside.  
The space was uncomfortably tight, especially with Philip's size. I could feel his hardness pressing against my soft body, and I gulped nervously, only to find him smirking down at me. I had the urge to punch him.  
"You, you pervert!" I hissed through clenched teeth, my frustration boiling over.  
"Babe, you're the one who-" I quickly covered his mouth, my heart pounding as I heard Megan's footsteps outside the door where we were hiding.   
The doorknob rattled violently, sending a jolt of panic coursing through me. Oh no! Megan was on the brink of discovering us! If she barged in and found me here with my erratic ex-husband in this confined space, I'd be utterly defenseless.   
The mere thought of her accusing me of being a slut and delivering a stinging slap was enough to freeze me. I wouldn't have any excuse.  
"Are you looking for something, ma'am?" a staff member's voice interrupted, sensing Megan's search. The rattling ceased.  
In the cramped space, Philip unexpectedly sucked on my finger, the same hand I used to cover his mouth. My lower lip nestled between my teeth, fighting back the urge to let out a moan right then and there.  
Philip, this fvcker, had me trapped against the wall. I couldn't break free from his embrace as he dry-humped me, his tongue exploring my neck with a sickening familiarity. His large hand roamed up my smooth legs, sending shivers on my skin.  
Shit! Gasps escaped my lips, feeling Philip's finger on my wet, delicate center. No... the relentless voice of my head clamored, vehemently arguing why I should deny myself the blissful pleasure unfurling within me.  
I clung to Philip desperately, my breaths ragged.  
"Did you hear that?" Megan's voice cut through the fog in my mind, bringing me back to reality beyond the walls of this room, where I found myself trapped in Philip's grasp.  
Philip silenced me with a forceful kiss, drowning out any protests in my mind. I found myself responding to his mouth, craving more of him. His touch was intoxicating, enough to silence my doubts and desires for resistance.  
"No, I didn't hear. Oh, right! It's probably the centralized air conditioning system. The unit for the entire office is located here, Ma'am. Do you need anything?" The person Megan spoke with began to feel uncertain, particularly because Megan was a visitor at the BM Technologies building.  
"No, thank you," Megan replied. "Um, did you just pass by here? Did you encounter anyone in the hallway before coming here?"  
"I didn't encounter anyone," the woman replied.  
"I just came from the ladies' room! I heard some rustling; that's why I asked. I'm with someone, and maybe they got lost. Sorry about that."  
Their voices outside disappeared after a few moments. It was precisely the same time I reached my climax with Philip's magnetic finger!  
"Oh, my God! Shit!" I exclaimed.  
My chest rose and fell rapidly, and my legs trembled with the intensity of the orgasm. Philip sensually ran his tongue along his finger, sending waves of arousal coursing through me.  
'That was so fvcking sexy!' 
His lips reached my reddened ear, whispering, "So fvcking good! I can't wait to let my very own tongue caress your pussy!"  
His words snapped me back to reality. Straining against Philip's grasp, I pushed myself away with every ounce of energy I had left, reassuring myself that no one else was around anymore.  
"You, fvcker!" I snarled at Philip.    
He smirked. "Sarah, it was you who pushed me into this tiny room. I merely gave you what you desired. Your body calls me! I've told you this, haven't I? I own your body, unquestionably!"  
I despise that he was correct!  
Feeling exasperated, I stormed away from him. My goodness! The intensity of desire coursing through my veins was unbearable!   
That wild and dirty man!   
I couldn't fathom how he still ignited such fervor within me! Tonight, I need comfort from my vibrator's embrace! 
After composing myself, I returned to Jakob's office.  
"Are you okay?" Jakob inquired, noting the flush in my cheeks and the redness of my neck.  
"I'm fine," I deflected swiftly, changing the subject. "Are you sure you don't want to join me at the apartment?"   
I offered him the spare room in my two-bedroom unit, considering the possibility of having a roommate. He hesitated, insisting he was content with his living arrangement with his male roommates in their four-bedroom apartment.  
However, I couldn't rid myself of the nagging sensation that Jakob felt embarrassed about sharing living quarters with me.  
"Here's my car key. Feel free to use it," I offered.  
"Are you sure?" he inquired.  
"Absolutely! My apartment is just a short walk from this building. Take good care of my baby!" I reminded him before bidding farewell.  
With my suitcase in hand, I made my way to the rented apartment where I'd be residing for the month here in Henderson. My family could afford to cover my stay in the hotel, which was undeniably more comfortable. However, opting for an apartment was a financially prudent choice. I wanted to avoid any speculation about my financial means.   
When I arrived at the address, I was taken aback to find the light on. Given my understanding that the apartment was available for my use tonight, this came as a surprise. Wanting to confirm, I promptly contacted Mrs. Henderson, the owner.   
"Hello!" I greeted her.  
"Ms. Sarah, have you already arrived at my apartment?" Mrs. Henderson inquired.  
"I simply wanted to verify that the apartment I'm renting is apartment number 5, the orange building?" I sought confirmation.  
"Yes, that's correct! Enjoy your stay! I'm off to Greece, so I won't be able to meet you tonight," she replied.  
Having received the key from her earlier at the office, I didn't anticipate any issues. "Um, the light inside is on," I mentioned.  
"Ahhh... Perhaps the cleaner left it on earlier. I'm already at the airport, and the caretaker assured me everything is in order. Enjoy your stay, Ms. Sarah!" Mrs. Henderson reassured me.  
To avoid further inconvenience, I bid her farewell and stepped into the apartment, greeted by an ambiance that promised a perfect escape from the chaos of work. Yet, as I swung open the main door, my heart skipped a beat, and a jolt of astonishment coursed through me: there sat Philip, lounging on the sofa with eyes shut tight.  
"W-what are you doing here?!" I exclaimed.
###chapter 21: Power Play 
**Philip**  

"Are you Ms. Mitchell's husband?" Mrs. Henderson, a woman in her sixties, inquired, her brow furrowed. 
It was only noon, and Alex and I found ourselves here after discovering that Sarah had rented apartment number 5 near BM Technologies. 
"Yes," I confirmed to Mrs. Henderson. 
"I didn't know Ms. Mitchell was married," she remarked, seeming surprised. 
"She informed me that we were to stay here for a month, assuming I'd be departing Highland Hills next week to join her. I intended to surprise her by arriving today," I explained. 
Naturally, it's a lie! Even if I were to apply pressure to Sarah's nose, she wouldn't disclose her whereabouts. Nevertheless, I find comfort in the belief that she's alone and not lodging at the Martins' mansion or Amir Benner's residence. 
Despite my reassurances, Mrs. Henderson's scrutinizing gaze made me wonder if she doubted my intentions. 
"I'll call Ms. Mitchell to make sure. You know I can't just hand over the keys to someone I haven't spoken to," she insisted. 
I halted her hand, already reaching for the phone to call my elusive wife. "Madam, as I've said, I want to surprise Sarah." 
"Here's the proof, Mrs. Henderson," Alex said, offering the lady the iPad displaying a copy of my marriage certificate with Sarah. 
Mrs. Henderson's eyes widened in surprise. It seemed she finally accepted the explanation I had provided. "Oh! I apologize, handsome man, for doubting you. You see, I'm always wary of potential scams and tenant issues." 
"That was my final wish-to spare my wife any trouble. Mrs. Henderson, I understand you've been longing to visit your daughter in Greece. What if I make that happen for you now?" 
She dropped what she was holding, her hand flying to cover her mouth in disbelief. "Are you serious?" 
"Absolutely! My assistant will ensure everything runs smoothly. You'll enjoy a one-month vacation in Greece, with all expenses covered." 
Her gratitude overflowed in heartfelt words; her disbelief evident in the way her hands trembled. It became clear to me that I had to swiftly arrange for the lady to leave town to preempt any potential conflict with Sarah. 
I couldn't quite grasp my intentions regarding Sarah. All I knew was that Serenity Pines Estate felt incomplete without her presence, and I felt a strong urge to bring her back. 
Sarah was someone I desired to possess. I couldn't bear the thought of her being with other men. Every breath she took should belong only to me. 
As intended, the lady's focus shifted entirely to her upcoming vacation, and she became oblivious to everything else. 
*** 
Sarah's voice stuttered as she demanded, "W-what are you doing here?!"  
The surprise in her tone matched the disbelief on her face at finding me inside the apartment. 
For a fleeting moment, I couldn't help but admire her stunning features and enviable physique, imagining tracing my tongue along her smooth skin. But as I rose to my feet, I noticed the horror dawning in her eyes as I closed the distance between us. 
Unable to resist the impulse, I gently embraced her petite frame and planted a passionate kiss on her full lips.  
"Ehm!" Sarah protested, trying to escape from me. But her lips held an irresistible allure that nearly caused her to shed tears when I finally pulled away. With a satisfied grin, I savored the taste of her lingering on my lips, casting a mischievous glance her way. 
"Get out! Leave this apartment!" Sarah's anger reverberated in her words. "I'll report you for trespassing!" 
"Feel free," I retorted, unfazed. "Mrs. Henderson granted me access. She's going to Greece." 
Sarah's shock was palpable. "You sent her away?! Fine! If you want to stay here, I'm leaving. But you'll need to cover the rent I paid Mrs. Henderson!" Her anger burned through her scolding. 
Without hesitation, I retrieved my phone and tapped away at the keypad. Within moments, Sarah's phone beeped, and her widened eyes betrayed her astonishment at the message she received. 
I have received a notification from the bank indicating, "Your request for a bank transfer to account number xxxxxx4575 has been successfully processed, with the transferred amount USD 10,000.00." 
"Keep the change," I casually remarked to Sarah. 
"You, moron! I rented this apartment because it's close to the office!" Her teeth gritted in annoyance. 
"Well, no problem! You can stay as long as you like. If you want me to buy this home for you, I will. I can even arrange for Mrs. Henderson to stay in Greece if you prefer." 
Sarah shrieked, and I found it absolutely cute! 
She marched out of the apartment. "Come on, Sarah! You still have work tomorrow. Where are you going?" 
"Far away from you, frickin' moron!" she snarled, gesturing her middle finger in the air, leaving me perplexed by her sudden attitude. 
As she retreated from the door, just then, my vehicle pulled up. When Alex got out, he seemed shocked to see Sarah. 
"B-boss? Is that Madam Sarah?" Alex asked. 
"Follow your Madam," I commanded the driver before turning to Alex with a glare. "And you, Alex, inform every hotel in town not to accept Sarah Mitchell, or they'll face the consequences." 
"Yes, boss," Alex replied. 
I wanted Sarah to understand how much she should rely on me! Am I being too confident in saying that? Absolutely! 
A couple of hours later, Alex informed me that five hotels had already turned down Sarah. It was two in the morning when I learned that Sarah had settled in a motel for the night. 
I clenched my teeth in frustration. Who would willingly choose to sleep in such a rundown motel? Only Sarah, it seemed. 
She might have won this round, but I was determined to ensure she'd return tomorrow. Little did I anticipate that, before dawn, the driver would bring Sarah back to me. 
*** 
**Sarah** 

"I apologize, ma'am, but we're fully booked tonight," the woman informed me, having just taken down my information.  
Unfortunately, all booking applications are unavailable for this evening, which is why I couldn't book online. 
This marked my fifth unsuccessful attempt at finding a hotel. All I wanted was a damn shower! 
Exhaustion crept in as the clock struck two in the morning. I could feel the weariness from hours of futile accommodation searches weighing me down. 
Philip was orchestrating this, I was certain! That's how petty he was! My desire to strangle him right now intensified within me! 
Stepping out of the hotel, I noticed Philip's Bentley Continental parked outside.  
I refused to give him satisfaction; that's why, with determination, I whipped out my phone and began searching for a motel. 
Hailing a taxi, I directed the driver to take me there. 
The taxi dropped me off at an aged building, where I finally secured a room. It seemed that idiot hadn't anticipated my decision to opt for a motel. In the elevator, a couple was on the brink of exchanging saliva as we ascended to the upper floor. Despite the woman's audible moans, I opted to disregard their behavior. 
Entering the cramped room, I hurled my suitcase aside in frustration. 
Exhausted as I was, the idea of a shower to cleanse myself of Philip's unwanted touches and kisses crossed my mind. However, the feeble trickle of water from the showerhead threatened to prolong the process indefinitely. 
As I scanned the room, my eyes caught sight of a repulsive stain on the bedsheet, filling me with disgust. Was this room even cleaned properly? Determined to address the issue, I reached for the phone to call customer service. 
"Could you please replace my bedsheet? There are some unknown stains on it that I'd rather not dwell on." I don't want to think that it's a man's cvm. I grimaced at the unsettling possibility. 
"I apologize, ma'am. We change all bed linens daily. Tomorrow morning, I'll ensure the sheets are promptly replaced." 
'But I need it tonight!' I wanted to protest but restrained myself. "Don't you have a spare?" 
"It's currently in the laundry and will be ready for tomorrow. As mentioned, we maintain a daily change routine." 
"And the water pressure in the shower? It's barely a trickle," I couldn't help but voice my dissatisfaction. I still felt unclean. 
"Ma'am, you seem to have several complaints. If you desire a more upscale experience, perhaps a five-star hotel would better suit you. You're welcome to leave our establishment," he retorted, visibly frustrated by my feedback. 
"No, I apologize. I'll wait for the new linen tomorrow morning. Thank you," I replied calmly. 
"Ugh!" I groaned into the pillow. 
Resigning myself to the situation, I draped a bath towel over the bed. I didn't have the energy to ponder the room's cleanliness. Exhausted, all I craved was sleep, knowing I had an early morning ahead at the office. 
As sleep began to claim me, I was jolted awake by a sudden loud noise. 
"Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Fuck harder!" came from the room beside me.   
Augh! My head is pounding relentlessly. This has to be one of the most excruciating nights I've ever endured. 
Suddenly, three men forcefully kicked the door, causing me to startle in shock!
###chapter 22: Unwelcome Trio 
**Sarah** 

"Who are you?!" I exclaimed, my drowsiness evaporating as the door swung open abruptly, revealing three imposing figures barging into the room. The space felt constricting, leaving me nowhere to escape. Panic surged through me as they closed in and seized me. 
"Help!" I cried out, but my plea was silenced as one of them clamped a hand over my mouth, his breath reeking really bad. 
"Hey there, babe! We're just here for your belongings," one of them smirked. 
'Babe, my foot!'  
My struggles against his iron grip proved futile as his fingers clamped down, imprisoning me further. 
"Someone tipped us off that the contents of your bag are valuable," another interjected, snatching my luggage. 
Desperation fueled my resistance as I writhed in the grasp of one of the men. No! 
Their eyes darted around the room, searching for any other valuable items they could seize before the man who had snatched my luggage made his exit. 
'No! My medicine is in there!'  
"Let's get out of here!" another urged. 
"Wait! Shouldn't we have some fun with this little darling first?" the man holding me suggested lewdly, extending his tongue suggestively. 
A tsunami of nausea crashed over me as his foul breath slithered toward me, a putrid fog that threatened my senses. 
I recoiled in disgust from his odor, yet he had the nerve to call me 'darling'! His accomplice, standing beside him, cast me a lecherous glance, his eyes smoldering with suggestive intent. 
"Rare to encounter something so enticing," he remarked. 
'No! Please, Lord! I won't do anything bad anymore!' 
I sank my teeth into his hand, only to be assaulted by the overpowering taste of salt that nearly made me retch! Did he ever bother to wash it? In a state of horror and disgust, I fled, my features contorted in a grotesque mask of repulsion. 
"Hey! Get back here!" the two men barked after me. 
Seeking escape, I darted into the fire exit, descending the stairs with reckless haste. I didn't care where I ended up; I couldn't bear another moment in the presence of that shameless breath. I was just on the fourth floor, mere steps away from the ground level. At that moment, I didn't care where my escape route led; I just needed to get away. 
Emerging from the fire exit, I found myself face to face with one of the intruders emerging from the elevator. They had split up, one taking the stairs, the other the elevator. 
"Damn it!" They could take everything, but please spare me from that foul breath! 
I fled, but before I could escape, a hand closed around my arm, and I screamed. 
"Ah!" My scream pierced the stillness of the night. 
"Madam Sarah, please, calm down! I'm Josh. Boss Philip sent me to watch over you..." I spun around and met with the sight of a tall, muscular stranger. He exuded a pleasant scent as if he had just stepped out of a shower, erasing the lingering odors of those other men. 
"There she is!" Two figures emerged from the motel exit, their shouts filled with aggression as they pursued me. 
Josh, the man who had introduced himself, shifted his gaze to the approaching men. 
"That chick belongs to us!" one of them declared. 
"I'm not your chick! Perhaps you should prioritize brushing your teeth!" I retorted sharply. While I sought a man who can give me the love I've always dreamed of, a love that makes me feel truly alive, I won't settle for someone who doesn't even bother to brush their teeth! 
"Please, I'll grant you any request. Just rid me of those two imbeciles!" I implored Josh. 
As the two aggressors closed in, Josh swiftly incapacitated them with a series of precise strikes until they lay unconscious. 
My chest heaved with a tumultuous blend of terror and frustration. Despite my best efforts, tears burst forth like a sudden downpour, catching me off guard on this unexpected night. 
"Are you unharmed, Madam Sarah?" Josh inquired once more. "Allow me to escort you back." 
Josh guided me towards Philip's car, and I did not attempt to resist. He reached inside and pulled out a fleece, handing it to me.  
"Cover yourself first," he murmured. 
As I took the fleece from him, I felt a chill, a sudden awareness that the only garment covering my lower half was a flimsy pair of panties. The realization hit me like a wave, and I could feel the tears against my cheeks, tracing down in silent streams. 
"Thanks!" I mumbled as I wrapped the blanket around me, leaving only my face exposed. 
Josh guided me into the car. I no longer protested, too exhausted to care whether he was taking me back to apartment no. 5. I had nothing with me anyway. 
What infuriated me further was the unmistakable scent of Philip emanating from the fleece Josh had provided. 
All I wanted was to sleep. I silently wept in the backseat while Josh cast worried glances in my direction. 
I barely registered the journey, lost in my exhaustion, until the car came to a halt at apartment no. 5. The door opened after a moment's pause. 
Philip's expression soured at the sight of me. 
"What happened to her?" my ex-husband inquired of Josh, his tone betraying irritation. 
"I noticed a man carrying luggage that appeared to belong to Madam Sarah. It seemed suspicious, but I didn't know her room number. I went to the information booth for assistance, and that's when I saw Madam Sarah descending the stairs. Two men followed her," Josh explained calmly. 
"I assigned you to watch over Sarah! What happened, and why is she crying now?!" Philip's voice thundered with anger. 
"I made a mistake, I'm sorry, boss." 
"You know your mistake. You'll be suspended for a month! And forget about any bonus. Inform Alex to investigate what happened tonight," Philip's words dripped with frustration as he clenched his teeth. 
Josh nodded, acknowledging his fault, and refrained from offering any further excuses. 
Philip gently lifted me from behind the car, cradling me in his arms as he carried me inside the apartment building. Despite my initial urge to protest, the warmth of his touch and the comforting scent of his cologne washed over me, soothing my troubled soul. At that moment, somehow, my heart instinctively knew what was best for her. Thus, I chose not to argue, trusting in its gentle guidance. 
Philip settled me onto the soft sofa, his expression contorting in dismay at the sight of my dirty feet, the only visible sign of distress besides my tear-stained face. 
"Why are you barefoot?!" His scolding tone cut through the air. 
"Stupid! What did you expect? Should I have asked the intruders in my room to wait while I put on shoes before they chased me? Ridiculous!" Tears streamed down my face as I snapped back at him. 
He didn't respond, instead headed to the bathroom. Returning with a wet towel, he sat in front of me, gently wiping my feet. 
After a while, he lifted his gaze to mine. "Did they touch you?" he inquired, perhaps trying to understand the cause of my distress. "If only you had stayed here in the apartment, this wouldn't have happened. Now you're crying nonstop!" he added, his irritation palpable. 
Tears streamed down my cheeks even harder after receiving a scolding. "Who wouldn't cry? They took my luggage, and all my clothes were in there! I have nothing to wear, nothing to use!" I exclaimed. 
Philip's expression soured. "Wait, so you were practically naked when you fled from your room to the exit?" 
"Almost naked!" I confirmed. 
He narrowed his eyes. "Stop crying... I'll lend you my shirt." 
His hand felt like a weighty anchor as he wiped my feet, visibly suppressing his seething rage. 
"The guy who grabbed me had the foulest breath!" I added, continuing my litany of complaints. "I nearly passed out!" 
"Did he try to kiss you?" Philip asked, irritation creeping into his voice. 
"Of course not! If he had, I'd be dead! He was even salty," I sobbed with each complaint. 
"Are you absolutely sure he didn't touch you or try to kiss you?" he pressed, seeking reassurance. 
"I said no! Why are you so insistent?" I wanted to punch Philip, but his incredibly good-looking face made me pause. I couldn't bring myself to ruin its charm with any negativity. 
"Because you're crying as if they assaulted you!" he retorted. 
"Their odor was unbearable. My innocent nose was assaulted, and now I feel absolutely filthy!" I sobbed. 
"Don't worry, I'll find them. I'll confront them for you. Is that the only reason you're crying?" His disbelief was palpable. 
"I would appreciate it if you could ask them to take a bath before showing them to me. Besides my personal preference for cleanliness, I'm also here with my relentless ex-husband! If you hadn't stirred up trouble, I could have enjoyed my evening," I complained to Philip, tears welling up. 
He was speechless at my remark, squinting hard and pinching the bridge of his eyebrows. Without a word, he lifted me again and carried me to the bathroom. Placing me gently on a chair, he turned on the water in the spacious bathtub. 
"Furthermore, I want you out of this apartment by tomorrow! I don't need Megan to get jealous," I added, noticing his sour expression.  
The jerk ignored me! He instead removed my fleece and helped me into the bathtub, even going so far as to put a shower cap on my head to protect my hair from getting wet. 
As he began to scrub my body, my heart questioned his motives.  
"I can handle this myself!" I exclaimed, snatching the soft scrub from his hand. "It's not like you've ever done this before!" 
His jaw stiffened at my words, and he angrily stormed out of the bathroom. 
I needed to find out who was behind those men who had broken into my place. The intruder's revelation hinted at a puppet master pulling sinister strings from the shadows, dictating the violation of my motel's room! 
I have to outsmart Philip because I don't want to be indebted to him. The following day, I was taken aback by what unfolded.
###chapter 23: Request of Trust 
**Sarah** 

After lunch, I made my way to BM Technologies. Jakob's surprise was palpable when I walked into the office, especially since it had been too long since he had seen me clad in bright green-a stark departure from my usual black attire.  
I couldn't help it; Philip bought me the outfit. 
"Let me catch my breath first. We can delve into the questions and answers later," I declared to Jakob. 
He simply shrugged, offering me a seat and a glass of water as I settled into the swivel chair, allowing me a moment to compose myself. 
"So," he prompted. 
"I was robbed last night," I began. 
"What? Where? What happened?" Jakob fired off questions in quick succession. 
"It was Philip! He played a prank on me!" I recounted the events of the previous night, including the rejection by major hotels due to my tumultuous past with my ex-husband. 
"I couldn't even call you to figure out what was going on with the accommodation app. Everything was down last night, and it was all over social media," I remarked. 
A mischievous grin spread across his face, finding some humor in the situation. "Your ex definitely wants you back. It's the only explanation for his antics." 
"Excuse me?" I retorted incredulously. 
"Yeah, you know how men are," Jakob replied with a chuckle. 
As thoughts raced through my mind, I couldn't shake the realization. "No, that can't be true. Philip just craves the idea of having me at home, submissive, playing the role of the typical, old-fashioned wife. He doesn't truly care for me."  
He killed my baby! 
The pain surged anew as the memory of my lost child pierced through my thoughts. My fists clenched involuntarily, and the tightness in my chest returned with a vengeance. Damn it! I need to regain control. I don't have any medication on hand. 
"S-Sarah, are you okay?" Jakob's concerned voice pierced through the haze, but I struggled to focus. His form seemed blurred, his words suffocating. 
"Damn! Should I call for a medic?" 
"No, just... I didn't sleep well," I stammered, hoping to deflect attention. 
I couldn't afford to attract notice in Bronn's office. If he caught wind of my distress, Amir or Grandpa Mitchell would inevitably intervene. Pushing aside thoughts of Philip and our tragedy, I willed myself to regain control. 
"I apologize," I managed, turning to Jakob. "Last night's events rattled me. Please help me track down those thieves. They stole my phone. Let's find it." 
Just as I spoke, the office phone rang, momentarily breaking the tension in the room. 
"Hello?" Jakob answered the call. "For Ms. Mitchell?" 
I furrowed my brow upon hearing my name, wondering who Jakob was talking to. 
"Alright!" Jakob said before hanging up the handset. 
"What is it?" I asked, curious. 
"You have a visitor. He said his name was Josh. He's in the building lobby," Jakob replied.  
Although strict regulations barred unauthorized individuals from entering the building, BM Technologies maintained a vigilant team of information staff positioned in the lobby.  
"Josh?" The only Josh I knew was Philip's driver and bodyguard, who helped me last night. As far as I knew, Philip had suspended him. What did he need from me? 
"Yes. You don't know anyone named Josh?" Jakob inquired. 
"Uhm, I'll check," I replied simply. 
Jakob followed me as I headed to the lobby to meet the person looking for me. 
My heart skipped a beat as I saw the figure in the lobby. Josh rose to his feet, a towering presence that exuded an aura of strength and command. Gosh! He was breathtakingly handsome, reminiscent of a Hollywood action star! I also noticed the bag beside him. 
"Hello!" I spoke, trying to mask my surprise. 
"Good afternoon, Madam Sarah," he replied, stealing a glance at Jakob. 
"Ah, I was just accompanied by Jakob. He was merely concerned about my well-being," I explained, aware of their perception of me as the man's secretary. "Anyway, do you require anything from me?" 
I sank into the plush embrace of a lobby couch, my silent signal urging Jakob to depart. With a nonchalant shrug, he turned back inside, visibly reassured of my safety. 
"Last night, you mentioned you'd fulfill all my wishes just to ensure your safety from the two intruders in your room." 
Sht! Yes, I recall that now. 
"I apologize, Madam Sarah. I can't bear the punishment from Boss Philip. I've only been on his team for six months, and I won't survive without my job. I won't receive anything, not even the bonus." 
His request hinted at financial strain, though Philip's employees were typically well-compensated, with bonuses generously tied to Philip's earnings. 
"Are you saying you need money?" I vocalized my suspicions. 
"No, Madam. Th-that's not what I meant. I just want to return to my job. Furthermore, I handed the intruders over to the police last night, and they're currently in custody." 
As his words reached my ears, a wave of relief swept over me. "So, you defied Philip? Aren't you worried he might find out?" 
He couldn't answer directly, but his visible tension spoke volumes. "I don't want trouble, but knowing Boss Philip, he won't revoke the punishment. That's why I need your help, Madam Sarah." 
"I'll help you, but I need to know who tipped off those three individuals at the motel where I was. Their blatant entry into my room suggests someone informed them about the valuable items in my baggage." 
"I've obtained that information already, so no need to worry." 
His revelation startled me. Philip's associates were astute; they wasted no time in taking action. "And?" 
"It was Madam Cornell." 
My lips pursed, a hint of shock registering on my face. Only two people could have given Madam Cornell information about my presence in Nevada-either Megan or Philip. 
After regaining my composure, my narrowed eyes betrayed my suspicion. Megan was the only one who had a motive to harm me, making her the likely informant to Madam Cornell. 
Josh's actions spoke volumes about his dedication to helping me. Not only did he ensure that the three thieves were apprehended and brought to justice, but he also went the extra mile to gather crucial information about the individuals plotting harm against me. 
"I still have something for you," Josh stated as he retrieved a duffel bag I had noticed earlier and placed it in front of me. "Since your luggage was destroyed, I've put your clothes in here. And apart from that," he added, producing a white medicine bottle from his pocket, "I also found this medicine among your belongings. Are you currently taking Citalopram and Benzodiazepines?" 
I hastily took the medicine from his hand, realizing that my secret might now be exposed. "This isn't Citalopram." 
As panic began to grip me, I closed my eyes tightly, feeling as though I couldn't breathe and growing dizzy. 
"That's odd. I checked the bottle's contents out of curiosity, and I did find Benzodiazepines and Citalopram. They're typically prescribed for panic attacks, depression, and other mental health conditions," Josh explained. 
"What?" I stammered, my lips quivering. "No... you're mistaken. This isn't for panic disorder, it's..." 
My trembling intensified, and nausea threatened to overwhelm me. I needed my medication-I couldn't breathe! 
Josh grabbed the medicine bottle, reluctant to offer me a portion of the tablet to ingest. "May I ask where you obtained this, Madam Sarah?" he inquired, seeking clarification. "If you're experiencing panic attacks, it may be wise to consider changing your medication. These medications are too strong for a body that's working as it should. It would be advisable to seek guidance from a healthcare professional."   
"No, it's impossible! These are medications for heart failure," I argued vehemently, though my body quivered with uncertainty as Josh persisted. 
"No, I'm certain the pills in that bottle are for mental disorders. My mother suffered from psychosis, and those were the medications she used. Benzodiazepines are detrimental to the body. Overdosing can lead to both brain and heart damage. In moments of panic, when you feel breathless, it's easy to mistake it for heart failure. The pills in that bottle could be the cause of your distress..." 
I stared at Josh, disbelief and horror etched across my face. With a hard swallow, tears welled up and streamed down my cheeks. Someone was playing a dangerous game with me.  
Someone wants to kill me!
###chapter 24: Puppeteer's Strings 
**Sarah** 

I clenched my fist in a surge of anger so intense that it felt like it was suffocating me. The symptoms I frequently experience-difficulty breathing, dizziness, shortness of breath-are all manifestations of panic attacks. They don't signify heart failure. 
As I stood on the balcony, desperately gasping for air amidst the storm of emotions raging inside me, the glass door suddenly slid open, unveiling Bronn. The unexpected encounter caught us both off guard. 
"What a surprise, Sarah! Hang on, are you crying?" Bronn's concern was evident. 
I hastily wiped away my tears, attempting to dismiss them with a wave of my hand. "It's nothing! I'm just pissed!" 
Rage consumes me like a blazing inferno! It's as if I've learned absolutely nothing from enduring three agonizing years of manipulation! 
"By the way, you look good in green!" Bronn offered a compliment. 
"Thank you," I managed to say, though tears threatened to spill once more.  
For a year now, I've worn black as a constant reminder of the grief from losing my baby. At this moment, I was engulfed by a mixture of sadness, anger, and self-pity, a departure from the familiar grip of panic attacks that haunted me, serving as a stark reminder of my tumultuous past. 
Josh advised against the medication prescribed by Dr. Morgan, suggesting the concept of self-healing, a notion I find myself aligning with. At this juncture, my trust extends solely to myself, and I intend to heed Josh's counsel and attempt to pursue this path of self-reliance. 
"Can I take a vacation for just five days?" I asked, my voice trembling as I brushed away fresh tears. 
Concern flickered in Bronn's eyes. "Did something happen to Grandpa Mitchell?" he inquired, his mind racing to find a reason behind my sorrow. 
I shook my head. "But I do miss him." 
"Alright! When are you coming back?"  
"I might return for Amir's engagement. I'll continue working even if I'm not here; I just need to clarify something," I replied simply. 
"Okay! I have a business in Dubai, too. You can join me on my private jet." 
I'm still unsure of my destination. It hinges on my ability to locate Dr. Morgan at this moment. 
"That's awesome! Thank you! I'll just message you the details of my vacation," I responded to Bronn. 
"Did something happen, Sarah?" he asked, still sensing my unease. 
"Nothing specific. I just need peace of mind, something that adults rarely get." 
At present, I must grant Josh's request to return to work and discuss it with Philip. Moreover, I need to focus on reducing my reliance on the medication Dr. Morgan prescribed. With resolve, I made my way back to the office I shared with Jakob. 
"Did you find anything?" I inquired. 
Earlier, I had tasked him with hacking into Dr. Morgan's computer. I want to uncover who the doctor has been communicating with over the past year, as it may shed light on why he sabotaged my recovery. 
Dr. Morgan remains oblivious to my true identity. His only knowledge is that Amir brought me to his clinic in Emirates Hills. 
"Yes! He exchanged emails with Ms. Jessica Woods, Amir's fiancée. Based on their conversation, your brother's girlfriend inquired about your situation, and Jessica concocted the story that you're Amir's mistress. That woman is insane! Tsk!" Jakob explained, shaking his head. 
Jessica is one of the individuals I'm contemplating confronting. I'm eager to expose her true colors to Amir. 
"Did you uncover anything else?" I inquired. 
Jakob met my gaze squarely before responding, "He regularly received a hundred thousand dollars from an account in Highland Hills, which he intends to visit this weekend." 
"He's heading to Highland Hills?" I exclaimed. 
"Yes!" 
Three individuals came to mind who might have connections to me in Highland Hills: Megan, Madam Cornell, and Philip. 
"The account name is Serena Blake. Do you know anyone in Highland Hills by that name?" Jakob asked. 
I wracked my brain, but no one by that name came to mind. 
"She might be one of Dr. Morgan's clients. It wouldn't be unusual for him to receive payments through electronic transfers from various accounts. I attempted to find someone named Serena Blake in Highland Hills, but my search yielded no results," Jakob added. 
"Could it be a pseudonym?" I furrowed my brow, questioning Jakob. 
He shrugged in response. 
"Whoever it is, I'll confront Dr. Morgan this weekend, wherever he may be. He's crossed a line, Jakob." 
"Has he harmed you in any way?" Jakob asked, his concern evident as he rose from his seat. 
"He tampered with the medication he's been prescribing me. That's why I enlisted your help to investigate him. I barely know Dr. Morgan; he was introduced to me by Amir. I can't recall ever having any issues with him. If he's done something to harm me, it suggests someone has ordered him to do so. I'll get to the bottom of this, and if Serena Blake is the mastermind, whoever she is, I'll uncover it!" 
*** 
Upon arriving at apartment number 5, I immediately noticed Philip's presence, thanks to his opulent car stationed outside. Stepping inside, I found my ex-husband seated on the floor in the living room, engrossed in his laptop on the central table. 
"Why are you still here?" I queried, arms folded, upon crossing the threshold. "Regardless, I need something from you." 
My abrupt request piqued his interest, prompting him to close his laptop. Setting my luggage aside, I took a seat opposite him. 
"I see you've already retrieved your luggage. How did you manage that?" Philip inquired. 
"That's beside the point. Listen, I have a debt to Josh, your driver-bodyguard. I'm here to ask you to lift the punishment you placed on him. Last night, I promised him that if he saved me from the intruders, I'd grant his request. So, bring Josh back to work because that's what he desires," I insisted. 
His gaze narrowed, and to my surprise, he disregarded the table, leaning in to kiss me abruptly. Despite my reluctance, he held my head in place, leaving me unable to evade his advance. It took several moments before he released me. 
"You son of a b-" I clenched my teeth, attempting to shield my flushed face with my hand. This scoundrel! He's becoming more audacious with his kisses! 
"Seems my wife has taken a liking to my bodyguard," he taunted. 
"You lunatic, prickin' bastard! I'll sue you for sexual harassment if you dare continue with such behavior!" I snapped in retaliation. 
"I'm just marking what's mine! I glanced away for a moment, and you've already formed a connection with Josh? Sarah, do I need to lock you up so that you could seduce no man?" Philip's accusation stung. 
"I did nothing! You fvckin' bastard! Besides, if I have a relationship with anyone, it's none of your damn business! You are my ex!" I emphasized the word 'ex,' but he seemed to disregard any categorization I had for him. 
"All I'm saying is, you don't need to suspend Josh from his job! He's performing excellently! I owe him a favor, and what he asked of me is not to be suspended because he can't afford not to work. I can easily compensate him with money if that's his concern. But what he wants is his salary! Since something related to me happened last night, that's what I'll ask of you," I explained patiently. 
Philip's face remained etched with irritation as he massaged his temples. It bewildered me to see him jealous of his bodyguard. What a d!ck?! 
"Fine! But since I'll be reinstating Josh for a month, you'll also be shadowing me for a month. You'll adhere to every word I say. How does that sound?" Philip's ultimatum caught me off guard. 
My eyes narrowed at his proposition. I didn't want to comply with Philip's demands, but I owed Josh a lot. What would be my plan now?
###chapter 25: Reconnecting Passion 
**Sarah**  

I reluctantly agreed to Josh's demands, which led me to tolerate Philip's shenanigans. Now, I'm stuck with the scoundrel in apartment number 5. 
A chef from a local hotel came by to prepare dinner for us, sparking my curiosity about Megan's absence. Where had she been these past days, not accompanying Philip?  
Unable to suppress my curiosity, I asked, "Where is Megan?" 
Philip's expression soured before he replied curtly, "She's at the hotel." 
Perplexed, I probed further, "Why didn't you accompany her? Your presence here seems unnecessary. Aren't you concerned for her safety at the hotel?" My question wasn't driven by genuine concern for Megan; instead, I was simply puzzled. 
Philip proceeded to pour soup into my cup, deflecting the conversation. "Eat more," he urged. 
His actions spoke volumes-he clearly didn't want to discuss Megan. 
Shifting the topic, I inquired, "Why are you still in Henderson? Do you not intend to return to Luminary Productions?"  
"I am still handling work matters while in Henderson and can continue to provide for you," he assured me, causing me to raise an eyebrow. "I will return to Highland Hills after the gala event that Megan and I are attending tomorrow."  
I couldn't help but be impressed by his stoicism. With the gala not until tomorrow night, I realized I had a window of opportunity to escape from Philip. 
"I'll be taking you home with me," Philip announced, prompting me to splatter soup from my mouth onto his face. He wiped his wet face with a towel, surprisingly unperturbed by my reaction. 
"What do you mean you're taking me to Highland Hills?" I queried. 
"You'll follow me in a month, remember?" he reminded me. 
"But I have a job," I countered mentally. Was he planning to conceal me in Highland Hills for a month? 
His expression soured at my excuse. "I'll give you a job at Luminary if you want one." 
I couldn't help but smirk. "I want to be a famous celebrity. Will you grant me that too?" 
He paused, considering. "Since when did you decide you wanted the admiration of many men?" 
I was momentarily speechless.  
"Philip, our deal was about becoming a famous celebrity. What does that have to do with men? Celebrities aren't objects of desire." 
"Many male fans idolize celebrities under Luminary," he pointed out. 
"Didn't you think that maybe I want to get rich? That's why I said that." A twist of discomfort tightened my features. 
"Hmmm... you want to get rich? I'll provide the means. Besides, you won't get rich as Jakob's secretary either." 
I'm speechless.  
"So, your plan for me is to become a submissive woman who will merely wait for you either at Serenity Pines Estate or Luminary's office. You want to control me, Philip." I ground my teeth, piecing together my ex-husband's scheme for me.  
But his response caught me off guard. "Yes," he admitted. 
My fist clenched. "That's not happening." 
I rose from my seat to leave, but he intervened forcefully. "Sit down, Sarah!" His voice thundered, but I paid him no heed. In a sudden, violent motion, he seized me, throwing me off balance and onto his lap. 
"Damn it! You're becoming difficult to control, woman!" he cursed. 
"I'm not your dog, Philip!" 
"Who said you're my dog? You're my wife!" 
I gritted my teeth. "I'm not your wife either, you jerk!" He hadn't treated me like one in the past, either! 
I struggled to free myself from his grasp, desperately attempting to rise from his suffocating hold, but his grip was an iron vice. 
"Stop wiggling your hips! Damn it!" 
I froze when I felt something big pressing from his trousers, my cheeks burning. "You're an ass!" 
"Yeah, yeah. Call me whatever you want, love," he sighed, skewering a piece of meat with a fork and feeding it to me. 
It dawned on me that I had barely eaten, having only had some soup. The silence between us was a refuge, a rare moment of tranquility. So, I allowed him to feed me while perched on his lap. 
The tension in Philip's body was palpable, radiating through his touch as he caressed my waist, leaving a trail of kisses along my neck while he fed me. Despite my best efforts to resist, I couldn't deny the rush of pleasure coursing through me. 
"Fvck!" he swore. 
In one swift motion, he lifted me into his arms, carrying me towards one of the bedrooms. My mind swirled, thoughts scattering like leaves in the wind as he guided me into the room, enveloping me in a haze of desire and anticipation. 
*** 
**Philip**  

I've desired to exert control over Sarah. It's a compulsion I couldn't resist. For three years, I wielded authority over our relationship, ensuring she remained under my influence. But observing her current reaction, it appears she's discontent with this dynamic. 
Nevertheless, the mere thought of her working at BM Technologies alongside Bronn or Jakob or residing here in Henderson with Amir filled me with an overwhelming sense of unease. The mere thought of other men encroaching upon her space disturbed me.  
At Serenity Pines, at least, she was solely in my presence. 
As I placed Sarah on the bed, my longing for her intensified. Yet, I knew I must restrain myself. Our past intimacy was undeniably satisfying, and it's that connection I yearn for the most. As I held her, I felt the familiar rush of desire, but I resisted the urge to act impulsively. 
"Please, just stay," I pleaded in a whisper, my words tenderly caressing her delicate ears before indulging in the sweetness of her skin.  
Entwining my legs around hers, I savored the sensation of her warmth against me. With a gentle touch, my tongue traced the contours of her neck, eliciting shivers of anticipation. At the same time, my hands explored the curves of her tiny waist. 
The exquisite response of her skin sent waves of ecstasy pulsating through me, a symphony of pleasure coursing through my veins. The familiar, intoxicating scent of her fragrance enveloped my senses, a soothing balm to my soul as my lips danced across her silken skin.  
I placed delicate kisses upon her navel, tracing every curve and contour of her torso with adoration. 
In that intimate embrace, Sarah's fingers tenderly caressed my hair, igniting a fervent passion within me. With an ardent yearning, my lips found their way to her concealed chest, where I seized hold of her, consumed by the hunger that surged through my body. 
"Philip..." Her voice, a melody of longing and desire, ignited a firestorm of emotions within me. 
As our gazes intertwined, a wave of foolishness dissipated within me. In that fleeting moment, I seized the opportunity to answer the silent plea in her eyes. Cupping her jaw, I breathed in the air of her parted lips. 
Our kiss was slow yet consuming, penetrated like a puzzle piece that fits perfectly into her round lips, allowing the desire in her body to escape even more. 
I wanted Sarah to understand, to feel in her core that she possessed every inch of my being. I longed for her to realize the depth of what she had been missing all this time-the profound intimacy of this shared moment known only to us. 
My hand traced a path upwards until it found the curve of her chest, gently caressing it. As I felt her hardened nipple beneath my touch, I knew she was ready. 
Feeling a shiver cascade down my spine, I was captivated by the lingering warmth of her fingertips against my neck. Our breaths intertwined in the air, charged with anticipation, while my swollen shaft, my pulse quickened, ready to pounce anytime soon. 
I thought this was why I craved Sarah-the intimate connection that enveloped us even in silence. 
"Philip..." she gasped, feeling the teasing trail of my palm as it danced along the delicate lace of her panties. In my mind's eye, I envisioned the contours of her form. The desire to possess her consumed me.  
"I've told you countless times, love. Can't you see? You are mine..." 
My mouth made love with her skin, recalling the sensation that had been absent during her days away. But before I could begin to undress her, a commotion erupted outside, interrupting our moment.
###chapter 26: Veiled Intrigue 
Sarah  

I could not resist the intoxicating sensations coursing through me as Philip's gentle caresses danced across my skin. His lips, the soft breath escaping them, and the gentle caress igniting every nerve ending on my skin all conspired to engulf my consciousness. 
"Sarah..." His voice, whispering my name, stirred me further. 
Just as I leaned in toward him, Megan's voice pierced through the air, shattering the moment like icy water dousing a flame. 
"Move! I want to see Philip! Why won't you let Philip out?" Megan's demand reverberated through the living room. 
"Damn it!" Philip's frustration was palpable as he retreated to the bed. "I'll handle the commotion outside." 
"Send Megan back to the hotel if you want to avoid trouble," I interjected casually, turning away from Philip.  
Confusion and turmoil waged a fierce battle within me. I reluctantly acknowledge the persistent ember of affection that smolders in the depths of my heart for Philip, an affection I thought extinguished but stubbornly refuses to die, so it's only natural for me to feel hurt in Megan's presence. 
'Pull yourself together, Sarah! Don't fall back into the mess!' 
I smoothed out my disheveled attire and trailed after Philip as he left the room. Megan's astonishment was palpable when she saw Philip and me emerging from the same room. 
"Why is Sarah here?" she demanded, her surprise evident. 
I nonchalantly shrugged my shoulders. Megan's opinion didn't hold much weight with me. "This is my rented apartment. If there's anyone unexpected here, it's Philip." 
Megan's reaction was evident as she clenched her teeth. 
"Since Megan is already picking you up, why not go with her?" I suggested to Philip. 
"No, Sarah. P-please do not misunderstand my presence here. I-I'm not picking up Philip. It just so happened that I got robbed at the hotel, so I'm here to look for him," Megan clarified. 
"You were robbed? Are you okay?" Philip's concern was genuine. 
Megan nodded tearfully, seeking solace in my ex-husband's embrace. "I'm scared, Philip" she confessed, tears streaming down her face. 
Philip comforted her, stroking her hair, and I couldn't shake the pang of discomfort at the sight. I felt like the antagonist in their romantic narrative.  
"I'll have the people who robbed your hotel room searched for. Don't worry. I'll ask Josh to accompany you so you won't be scared," Philip assured Megan. 
"What? No! Are you going to leave me alone at the hotel?" Megan's fear was palpable. 
Philip rubbed his temples, distancing himself from her momentarily. "How did you get robbed anyway? Have you reported it to the hotel?" he inquired. "I'll call the hotel to add extra security for you." 
"No. Um, i-it happened outside the hotel" Megan hesitated in her response. 
My brow furrowed as I noticed her expensive white handbag resting on the couch. Jewelry adorned her body as well. A faint smirk played at the corner of my lips, and I found her story amusing. It became evident that this woman was merely fabricating tales. 
Philip interjected, seeking more details about the supposed intruders. "What did the intruders look like for Josh to report them to the authorities?" he inquired. 
"T-there were three of them... one was dark-skinned, another had long hair, and one was thin and appeared unkempt," Megan replied tearfully. 
I couldn't resist commenting, "I'm beginning to think that all the thieves in Henderson resemble each other. And the frequency of thefts seems to be rising." With a sigh, I added, "Would you believe that three individuals matching the intruders' description in my room stole your belongings?" 
"W-what do you mean?" Megan swallowed, her voice tinged with anxiety. 
"Are you the Madam Cornell they're referring to?" I asked, maintaining my composure. 
"What? Philip, w-what is Sarah saying?" Megan looked visibly uneasy, sensing the weight of my emotionless interrogation. 
Philip seemed perplexed by my line of questioning.  
"Nothing," I replied simply. "Anyway, it's best if you accompany Megan to the hotel. I'll handle things here in the apartment. You can leave Josh with me." 
"What?" Philip's persistence in arguing lingered, but I turned away and went down the hallway toward the bedrooms. 
"Good night!" I said, closing the hard wooden door behind me before leaning against it for a while. 
Josh had mentioned that three men who had trespassed into my motel room gave the name 'Madam Cornell' as the instigator.  
However, it struck me as impossible for those three to have been involved in robbing Megan, considering they were currently in police custody. Megan's ability to accurately describe the intruders suggested she had seen them firsthand-meaning she must be Madam Cornell! 
That infuriating woman! 
The thought of one of the robbers having foul breath sent a shiver down my spine. 
'Gross!' 
I was uncertain about Megan and Philip's whereabouts-whether Philip had accompanied Megan to the hotel or not. I packed my things with the goal of getting to Highland Hills before Philip. 
Amir's call interrupted my packing. 
"Brother?" 
"Hey! Jessica sent you the details for her bridal party. Are you alright? I was in New York for a few days and returned to Henderson to handle some wedding matters." 
"I haven't received any updates yet. I contacted Jessica on Messenger, but she hasn't responded," I informed Amir. 
"She mentioned to me that you seem disinterested; she felt like you have no plans to attend our engagement or the wedding," Amir expressed. Feeling Amir's tension, I opted not to fuel the fire with negative remarks. Adding to his stress wasn't my intention. 
"I'm being honest about your relationship, brother. Perhaps it's best to rest for now," I suggested, silently hoping he would reconsider marrying Jessica. Nevertheless, I'm here in Henderson, fully committed to attending his wedding. 
"Why didn't you stay at my villa?" Amir inquired.  
"It's alright. I'll swing by Highland Hills first. Maybe we'll catch up at the engagement," I replied. 
Amir fell silent. "I'm feeling overwhelmed. I'll ask Jess to send you the details to keep you in the loop." 
I simply shrugged. "Looking forward to seeing you soon!" 
*** 
In the morning, I emerged from apartment number 5, my steps carrying me toward the airport. I consciously chose to leave most of my belongings behind, only to bring my laptop and a handful of personal items. 
"Good morning, Madam Sarah!" Josh's sudden greeting nearly caught me off guard. 
"Why are you here?" I inquired, slightly taken aback. 
"Boss Philip gave me strict instructions to accompany you. I'm your 24/7 guard now," he explained. 
My expression soured at the news. If that was the case, I had no choice but to bring Josh along. Philip had sent him back to work, assigning him the task of watching over me. 
"I'll take you with me. But you must promise not to disclose anything to Philip," I insisted, my tone firm. 
"It depends on the nature of the secret," Josh replied, his expression unreadable. 
"It concerns the medication. Last night, I had another panic attack. I intend to look into the matter. We agreed that Philip shouldn't be informed," I explained briefly, shooting a disapproving glance at the bodyguard. 
"Understood," Josh acknowledged. 
Throughout our journey to Highland Hills, I couldn't help but notice Josh's constant activity on his phone, undoubtedly reporting my situation to Philip. 
"Don't worry. I have prepared suitable responses for the boss. I informed him that you're doing well," Josh reassured me, attempting to alleviate my concerns. 
Philip's schedule was packed with a gala event and several interviews today, so I wondered if he had any clue about my activities. After leaving the airport, Jakob's message popped up: 
Jakob: 8 PM, clinic A, General Hospital. Those are the details for Serena and Dr. Morgan's meet-up. 
I still had ample time. Then another message arrived, this time from Jessica Woods: 
Jessica: Bridal party update - bridesmaids are in white gowns, and I'll be in black. 
After receiving the message, I double-checked the details with Amir. My trust in his girlfriend was shaky at best. It seemed my penchant for black attire had become fodder for her jests. Nevertheless, if wearing white was Jessica's preference, I would accommodate her wishes. 
As the taxi navigates the road, memories of Highland Hills flood my mind. I instinctively close my eyes, determined not to revisit the three years I spent as Philip's wife. 
'Pull yourself together, Sarah,' I murmured to myself. 
With Josh following me, we proceeded to the laboratory to have the medicine provided by Dr. Morgan tested. Following this, I settled into the hospital's coffee shop to work while awaiting the appointed hour.  
Little did I anticipate that Ethan Vanderbilt, a surgeon at the very hospital and a close confidant of Philip's, would catch sight of me. Oblivious to his presence, I was engrossed in furious typing on my laptop, completely unaware of his gaze. 
Time was precious, and I couldn't afford any delay.  
As the moment arrived to receive the test results, my fist tightened, and anger welled within me at the revelation...
###chapter 27: Shadow's Grip 
**Philip**  
"Wait, what?" Ethan's call took me by surprise as he relayed that Sarah was at Highland Hills with bodyguard Josh. 
I'm puzzled because Alex got reassurance from Josh that everything was fine. He's supposedly with Sarah-unless they're both in Highland Hills. 
"Yeah, I saw Sarah. She didn't notice me; she seemed preoccupied with work. She was at the coffee shop with your bodyguard," Ethan added. 
My fist tightened with frustration. That woman is brazenly pushing boundaries with every step she takes. 
"I also found out why she's here. Apparently, she had some medication checked at the laboratory," Ethan explained. 
"Medication?" I furrowed my brow in confusion. 
"Yes. I'm unsure whose medication it is or why she chose to have it checked here in Highland Hills when there are larger hospitals in Henderson. Maybe the medication originated from here?" Ethan speculated. 
I massaged my temples, feeling the onset of a pounding headache courtesy of Sarah's antics. 
Damn it! The thought of Sarah being close to my bodyguard and the reason why Josh is keeping things from me is getting on my nerves. 
"Get me those results. I need to know what's going on with that medicine. I'm heading to Highland Hills to follow Sarah!" 
"Hmm... I thought your ex-wife meant nothing to you," Ethan teased, prompting a frown from me.  
With no intention of elaborating, I requested, "Just do it for me, please." 
"Fine, fine," Ethan relented. 
After ending my conversation with Ethan, I bid Megan goodbye. I explained that I needed to return to Highland Hills. 
"What?" Megan exclaimed angrily. "You're leaving me alone at the event?" 
Though technically unnecessary, I understood her frustration due to our prior agreement to attend together. "Megan, I'm sorry. I need to take care of something. I must go." 
"Philip!" As I walked away, Megan called out my name in frustration. 
"To the airport," I instructed my driver before contacting Alex for pickup. I resolved to have the award I was meant to receive sent to me or delegated to Megan. At the same time, I sought answers regarding Sarah's sudden appearance in Highland Hills. 
Yet, the revelations awaiting me surprised even my expectations. 
*** 
**Sarah**  
Just as I feared, there's a threat on my life, and Dr. Morgan seems to be implicated. The laboratory report in my hands threatens to unleash a torrent of emotions. Yet, I must maintain composure in this suffocating situation. 
Could the perpetrator be Serena Blake? The benefactor who consistently supports Dr. Morgan financially? Who could she be? 
The motive remains a mystery, hinging on any connection I might have with Serena. 
"Madam Sarah, are you alright?" Josh's voice felt distant as he steadied me, offering water to help steady my nerves. "Take deep breaths, try to calm yourself." 
My trembling lips betrayed my inner turmoil. I longed for the comforting familiarity of Dr. Morgan's prescribed medication, yet hesitated to reach for it now that the truth lay bare in my hands. 
"I-I'll manage," I forced out through clenched teeth. 
Soon, Jakob's call snapped me back to reality. I needed to gather myself to confront Dr. Morgan. Giving in to despair was a luxury I couldn't afford. 
"Hello!" 
"I've tapped into the hospital's security feed. I'm watching you as we speak," Jakob's voice crackled over the line. 
Raising my gaze, I met the unblinking lens of the surveillance camera mounted overhead. 
"Wait a sec. How? Jakob, you know that's against the law," I whispered, trying to keep my voice down. It's tough when anyone might overhear. 
"Easy Remember Dredd? The guy I often chat with? He's the one who upgraded the security cameras in that hospital. Well, he hooked up the hospital's security system for me. He gave me an hour to snoop around." Jakob's amusement was evident in his voice. 
"So, you're saying you have permission?" I couldn't help but roll my eyes. 
"You got it, doll! Anyway, Dr. Morgan and Serena Blake are in clinic A. But the person with the doctor has her back to the camera, so I need to be more knowledgeable. I just got permission now, so apologies if I'm a bit behind schedule." 
"No worries. How do I get to clinic A?" I inquired, relying on his guidance. 
Jakob provided directions, which I followed while keeping him on the line. Tailing behind me, silent as a shadow, was the bodyguard, Josh. 
As I approached clinic A, I noticed a male nurse or assistant stationed outside. 
"I need to divert the nurse's attention. Can you help me lure him away from his post?" I doubted he'd let me enter into the clinic. 
"Piece of cake!" Jakob assured me. It only took him three minutes before the nurse's phone started ringing. Soon enough, the nurse sprang up from his chair, looking flustered. 
"What did you tell him?" I asked Jakob.  
The nurse hurried past me and Josh, darting by with a visible unease in his demeanor. 
"I simply informed him that someone had hit his parked car outside. Since he only borrowed it, I figured he'd be eager to check on the damage," Jakob replied. 
"Impressive!" I remarked with a grimace before striding purposefully toward the clinic's door. "We'll catch up later," I said before hanging up. 
Silently, the bodyguard trailed behind me as I swung the door open, drawing the attention of the two figures inside. 
Encountering Madam Cornell, my ex-mother-in-law, didn't catch me off guard. She met my gaze with a steely resolve while Dr. Morgan's eyes widened in shock. 
"M-Ms. Mitchell? W-what brings you here?" Dr. Morgan's voice faltered. 
I shot a narrowed glance at Philip's mother, recognizing her as Serena Blake, though I kept that knowledge to myself, aware that revealing it would betray my investigation of the doctor. 
With a scowl etched deep into my features, I spoke bitterly, "Did you order Dr. Morgan to alter my medication? Medication for heart disease?" I accused, then directed my gaze to the doctor, whose eyes flickered uneasily. 
Madam Cornell smirked, retrieving a cigarette and lighting it. "So, you've uncovered the truth. Yes, I instructed Dr. Morgan to manipulate your medication. I anticipated that you'd only have a year left in this world, continuing to take those drugs-medication for a lunatic!" 
I shot a glare at her. "Medicine for psychosis? Between the two of us, you should be the one taking that medicine because you're a crazy old woman!" I snapped. 
"Ms. Mitchell, who do you think you are? You're just Mr. Benner's mistress! You wouldn't be able to afford my doctor's fee if it weren't for Mr. Benner! It's your fault for whatever's happening to you! Don't blame us!" the doctor's words stung, igniting my fury. 
My hands balled into fists. "You'll face the consequences for manipulating my medicine!" 
"This bitch!" The doctor cursed.  
"Tsk, tsk, Don't bother with her. It's good that she knows the truth," Madam Cornell remarked to Dr. Morgan. "Sarah, isn't it true that you went crazy in the past year? Didn't you go through depression? Here you are, still grieving," she said, gesturing towards my black attire. 
Tears welled up despite my efforts to hold them back; a mix of anger and pain flooded through me. Her words cut deep, resonating with the lingering ache in my heart from the loss of my baby. 
"I don't remember having any fault with you, Madam Cornell! As far as I know, I was a good wife to Philip!" 
"I don't need to explain myself to you, Sarah! You are just dirt!" 
The door flew open with force, causing me to flinch. I expected it to be the nurse entering, but the voice that filled the room belonged to someone unexpected. 
"What's going on here?!" Philip demanded, breaking the tense silence. 
Glancing at him, I couldn't help but wonder why he wasn't at the banquet as planned. Frustration surged within me, threatening to consume my composure. With a piercing glare, I locked eyes with him. A piece of paper clutched his hand, with Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt trailing behind him. 
"What's the meaning of this, Sarah?" Philip's voice carried a mix of concern and accusation as he waved the paper in the air. What medicines have you tested? Are these the same ones I've seen you taking before?" 
A cynical chuckle almost escaped me. Did I really think he wouldn't learn about today's test results? 
"Philip, let me explain," Madam Cornell intervened, her voice calm and her demeanor less intimidating. "Sarah... She's suffering from depression." 
"What?" Philip's incredulity was palpable. 
I couldn't help but be amused by my former mother-in-law's storytelling abilities. But what truly baffled me was Philip's apparent cluelessness. 
Or perhaps he's just pretending not to know? 
I hesitated to trust Philip again, fearing another deception.  
My gaze shifted back to Serena Blake, or Madam Cornell as she preferred to be called. It seemed inevitable that I would distance myself from her. Even in Dubai, she continued to manipulate me. I must strike back!
###chapter 28: Familiar Territory 
**Sarah**  

"Is it true? Are you suffering from depression?" Philip inquired, his concern palpable in his voice. 
Caught off guard, I grappled with how to respond. What aspect of his question should I address first? Yes, I had battled depression, a struggle exacerbated by the profound loss of my baby-a loss for which I held the Cornell Family responsible. Yet, the medical diagnosis I received was heart failure. 
"See? I told you she's unstable! Ending your relationship with Sarah was the right decision, Philip. Your presidential aspirations can't afford such complications," Madam Cornell interjected, her tone laced with disdain. 
Anger trembled within me as I turned to meet Madam Cornell's gaze, then Philip's. 
"Mr. Cornell, it's better to heed your mother's advice. Ms. Mitchell appears to be in an unstable state," the doctor interjected, fueling the already tense situation. 
Philip's response was curt and dismissive, further igniting my resolve. "Am I asking for your opinion?" he snapped. "Sarah, tell me right now-" 
"There's no need for explanation. Our relationship, if there ever was one, is over," I interjected firmly, turning my back to them and striding towards the door. 
I resolved to confront Madam Cornell. Her relentless interference demanded a response, and I was determined to show her my strength. She may perceive me as weak, but it was time to prove her wrong. 
"Sarah!" Philip's voice echoed through the hallway. 
"Philip!" Madam Cornell's voice quickly followed. 
Startled, I felt Philip's grip tighten on my arm. "What do you mean by that?" 
"Let me go!" I struggled to break free from his hold. 
But he paid no heed, hoisting me onto his shoulder effortlessly. 
"Philip!" I yelled, my body contorting uncomfortably on his shoulder as we made our way through the hospital corridor. Josh trailed behind us. 
"Josh, help me!" I pleaded, hoping for some intervention. 
"I'm sorry, Madam Sarah. I can only assist when the Boss isn't present," Josh replied apologetically. 
Philip shot Josh a warning glance before delivering a stinging slap to my buttocks, eliciting a sharp cry from me. 
"Aw! Aw! Ouch! You're despicable, you shameless brute! Let me down! Philip!" I continued to hurl insults at my ex-husband. 
"Quit acting like a brat! We're causing a scene among the patients and staff!" Philip snapped back at me. 
That's enough to silence me. I clenched my teeth and surrendered to his will, allowing him to lead me wherever I pleased. He deposited me onto the plush seat of the car before positioning himself to block any escape from the other door. 
With a steely gaze, Philip cracked open the car window, exchanging a tense glance with Josh, who dutifully passed my belongings to his employer. 
"You'll be relocated to the Luminary Productions security building. Await Alex's directive for your next assignment," Philip declared, his tone brooking no argument. 
Josh remained stoic, seemingly unfazed by his Boss's amusing behavior. 
"But Josh did everything right! His task was to safeguard me, and he fulfilled it admirably! Why move him?" I interjected. 
"Because I find it irksome when you two are in close proximity," Philip retorted bluntly, his annoyance thinly veiled. 
At that moment, I couldn't help but ponder Josh's invaluable assistance to me, realizing it likely grated on Philip's nerves. 
"What does that have to do with anything? The two of us won't be crossing paths anyway," I countered, knowing full well that avoiding Philip meant avoiding Josh. 
"Let's proceed," Philip commanded, brushing off my objection. It was then that I noticed Alex in the driver's seat.  
Annoyance tightened my chest, heightened by the audible rasp of Philip's controlled anger. I instinctively distanced myself from his presence, gravitating toward the window, where I leaned and observed the shifting scenery of Highland Hills unfurling along the familiar road.  
Exhaustion gradually overwhelmed me, coaxing my eyelids to droop as I sank into the plush comfort of the back seat. 
*** 
As I awoke, darkness surrounded me, but the familiar scent of sandalwood air freshener filled the room, mingling with the soft fragrance of the bed and the presence of the man whose arm enveloped me. Despite the lack of light, I recognized the confines of our shared space at Serenity Pines Estate, with Philip beside me. 
My fingers gently intertwined with Philip's brown locks, triggering a rush of memories from when our connection was distant. Even the simple act of touching him like this felt like an unattainable dream.   
"Sarah" His voice, a tender whisper, brushed against my skin as his lips traced the curve of my delicate neck. He had never called my name intimately like this. 
I surrendered to the sensation, closing my eyes as he inhaled my essence, the warmth of his breath sending a shiver through me. A gasp escaped my lips as I felt the heat radiating from Philip's body, his touch igniting a wildfire of desire within me. That's when I noticed that both of us were naked. 
Philip was meticulous about maintaining the cleanliness of the bed. He believed the body could potentially carry bacteria or viruses from the outside world, prompting us to clean or be naked before laying on the bed.  
"I want you, please I need to convince myself that you're real," he whispered, a hint of sadness coloring his words.  
Oh, how I yearned for our hearts to beat in harmony. Yet, it was Philip who revealed that our connection was bound solely to sexual feelings and nothing more. 
He didn't love me! 
Before I could even protest, his mouth enveloped my sensitive nipple, rendering my mind blank as my femininity reacted eagerly to his touch. The sensation of his wet tongue flicking against my crown sent shivers coursing through my nerves, igniting ecstasy in every fiber of my being. 
Philip loomed over me, his body pressing against mine as my palm eagerly explored every inch of him. His arms, chest, and back melded seamlessly with mine, intensifying the heat inside me. 
His breath, hot against my skin, sent delicious shivers down my spine, spreading pleasure as he parted my legs, causing them to hook around his arms. At the same time, his grip tightened on my chest, sending my body into a curl of vulnerability. 
"Shit!" I cursed as our lips parted; his attention now focused elsewhere on my body. His wet tongue traced over my shoulders while his hips swayed against my slick flesh. 
"Fvcking wet!" he remarked, the friction of his arousal against my moistened center eliciting a moan from me. 
"Oh, fvck!" I exclaimed, feeling his hard manhood pulsating against my delicate flesh. "Yes!" 
"It fvcking feels good, Sarah!" he murmured in a low voice. 
Damn him for delivering such incredible sex, for being the ultimate sexual partner, and fvck him as my ex-husband! Just like before, my thoughts were clouded by Philip; he consumed my mind, leaving little room for anything else. 
"Fvck me now, Philip!" I exclaimed. 
"What?" His voice carried a note of seriousness like it was near me.  
Suddenly, my eyes snapped open, and I surveyed the room. It was dimly lit, and Philip remained fully dressed in the tuxedo he wore at the hospital. I was still in my black dress, lying on the lover's couch in our bedroom, far from the scenario I had imagined. 
It's just a dream! Damn! 
Philip began unbuttoning his shirt methodically; his expression puzzled as he looked at me. 
My cheeks burned with embarrassment, my libido pulsing through my veins. I couldn't tear my gaze away from his toned abs, and the outline of his arousal only fueled my longing. Swallowing hard, I was consumed by the desire to be with him. 
A smirk played on Philip's lips as our eyes met once again. 
"Do you truly desire me to bed you? I won't decline," he pondered aloud. 
"W-who said that?" 
"You did. You screamed, 'Fvck me now, Philip!'" 
"What I said is, 'Release me now!'" I stood up and headed towards the door after seeing the amusement played on his handsome lips.  
This brute! What was meant to be a dangerous paradise turned into hell! I was on the verge of turning the doorknob when he grabbed the hem of my black dress and pulled me back. 
"Where do you think you're off to, woman?" he inquired. 
"Home! I only came to see Dr. Morgan here at Highland Hills, and I intend to return straightaway to Henderson!" 
The corner of his lips curled. "That's not going to happen, babe!" 
"Babe? Don't call me babe! And what do you mean, 'That's not going to happen?' What shouldn't have happened is me being here in Serenity Pines!" 
"Hmm... But we agreed that I would take you to Serenity Pines after the gala event. You agreed to accompany me for a month. You made my task simpler by arriving at Highland Hills ahead of time. Admit it, Sarah. You truly desire to return here by my side-you want to be my wife..." 
I'm speechless. My mouth hangs open, utterly stunned. 
"I don't know where you muster your self-confidence from," I said. But as his lips met mine, his mouth silenced any words I had left to say. 
This insane, despicable, asshole jerk! 
"I'll demand payment for each stolen kiss you've taken from me, or maybe I'll consider legal action for s*xual harassment!"  
"But you're the one who begged me to fvck you, babe."  
I'm annoyed and extremely embarrassed.  
I never fathomed that Madam Cornel and Megan would be incited to harm me simply because Philip brought me back to Serenity Pines Estate. 
Philip dragged me to his company the next day. To my dismay, I encountered his secretary flaunting her swollen belly in the lobby. 
There she stood, pregnant as can be, a sight that sliced through me like a dagger, plunging into my already wounded heart.
###chapter 29: That Betrayal 
**Philip**  

I missed Sarah's presence in our villa-that's what I was certain of.  
While I was conversing with Ethan over the phone in the library, Sarah was taking a bath in our room. All her clothes were still neatly arranged, ensuring she wouldn't encounter any inconvenience. 
Ethan began his explanation, "I conducted a small investigation into Dr. Morgan. I needed to apply some pressure to get him to talk... Last year, Mr. Amir Benner took Sarah to Dr. Morgan's clinic in Dubai for a check-up. Months later, Dr. Morgan received two offers-one from Mr. Benner's girlfriend, Jessica Woods, and the other from Serena Blake. 
"Dr. Morgan opted to accept Serena Blake's offer to manipulate Sarah's medication... Your ex-wife was grappling with panic attacks and severe depression. Yet, Dr. Morgan erroneously diagnosed her with a heart condition. It appears Sarah may have become reliant on the medication. It would be advisable for you to bring her to my clinic tomorrow. I'll arrange for her to meet with a specialist there." 
I gripped the phone tightly, struggling to comprehend how Sarah ended up in this situation. "Why is she battling depression? Could our marriage somehow be contributing to it? I recall we had a disagreement, and then she requested a divorce..." 
That night weighed heavily on me. It felt as though Sarah had reached a breaking point in our relationship. 
"Is that when you found her at Serenity Pines with another man? Is that when Sarah fell ill?" 
I pressed my fingers firmly against my temples, feeling the weight of our tumultuous three-year relationship bearing down on me like a suffocating blanket. I honed my skills at work, relentlessly pursuing the coveted position of president, desperate to prove my worth. 
"Could her depression stem from wanting to end things with me?" I pondered aloud. "Jane mentioned Sarah declining a university offer in London, giving it to my sister, only to forego enrollment herself. Sarah was a brilliant student; she might have harbored significant regrets about her decision." 
As I lack medical expertise, I present the various possibilities to Ethan. 
"True, it's plausible that her relationship with you, starting so young and then facing the pressures of Serenity Pines, may have contributed," Ethan offered. "But upon further investigation, that wasn't the primary cause." 
My muscles tensed. "If not that, then what?" 
"Sarah was pregnant," Ethan disclosed. 
"What?!" Shock pulsed through me, eyes widening in disbelief. 
"Dr. Morgan confirmed it, and I uncovered medical records indicating Sarah underwent an abortion last year here in Highland Hills. And then, Amir Benner paid her a visit in the hospital ward." Ethan's next words sent a shockwave through me. "Philip, I believe Amir may have impregnated Sarah... Dr. Morgan echoed the same suspicion." 
I slammed the telephone handset down, my frustration boiling over as I scanned the villa for Sarah. Words cannot convey the storm raging within me. I am consumed by a fury so intense that it blinds me. Darkness encroaches on my vision, a suffocating pressure grips my chest, and rational thought flees in the face of my seething rage. 
"Sarah!" My voice reverberated through Serenity Pines, but she was outside, locked in a heated exchange with Alex, insisting on leaving. 
"Let me go! I'm not staying here! Take me to the hotel!" Sarah's words fueled my rage, and I gripped her arms tightly, my teeth clenched, seeing through her façade of lies. 
"Where do you think you're going?" My tone was sharp, and my eyes narrowed with icy resolve. 
She faltered at my demeanor. "Philip, I-" 
She attempted to explain herself, but I cut her off, dragging her back into the house and up the staircase. It was reminiscent of the time I caught her with another man. 
"No! Philip! You're hurting me!" Her voice trembled with fear. 
But I turned a blind eye to her pleas, heedless of whatever explanations she might offer.  
In that instant, it felt like I had cast aside every shred of my sanity, hurling it out the window into the abyss of my fury. 
"Philip! What are you doing? It hurts!" she shouted, tears pooling in her eyes. 
I shoved her into the closet room, her feet slipping on the shiny wooden floor, fear etched on her face. 
"How could you?" I trembled with anger, and she recoiled, bewildered by my words. 
I gave everything to Sarah! Now I understand why she wanted a divorce. Amir got her pregnant, and to save face, she terminated the baby! 
"You'll stay here until you understand what you've done!" With a heavy heart, I closed the door and secured it with a lock. 
"No, no, please! Philip!" Her desperate pleas echoed through the villa. "It's dark in here, Philip! Please, let me out!" 
I descended to the kitchen, drowning out her cries with alcohol. 
"Aaah!" I screamed, hurling the glass against the wall after downing the amber liquid.  
I considered wiping clean the slate of her cheating, brushing aside the betrayal that marred our third anniversary. Yet, the bitter truth remains: Sarah's deceit has inflicted wounds upon our marriage that cannot be easily healed. 
I callously commanded Alex to ensure Sarah remained confined within Serenity Pines Estate before callously driving off. Even though I noticed my assistant seemed worried, I selfishly went to the usual bar where Ethan and I usually go. 
An hour slipped away in Ethan's company before Alex's frantic call, saying something happened to Sarah. 
*** 
**Sarah**  

In the days following my reunion with Philip, I sensed a shift in our dynamic. Our conversations stretched longer than they had in our marriage, and an undercurrent of sexual tension simmered beneath the surface. However, I quickly understood that any apparent difference in him was just something I imagined. 
The darkness enveloped the closet room, its shadows casting uncertainty over my surroundings. With the light switch situated outside in the bedroom, I found myself adrift, unable to find solace or assurance in the darkness. 
Anguish seized my heart as tears streamed down my cheeks unchecked. It was as if Philip had transported me back to a time when he was still my husband, a time when I felt unable to voice my desires, haunted by the fear of his potential reactions. 
Earlier, I witnessed the anger etched on his face simply because I expressed my desire to depart from Serenity Pines. In the dimly lit room, voices echoed, sending shivers down my spine. 
"Philip wished your baby to die!" My mother-in-law's voice pierced the silence. 
"Ahhhh!" Escaped my lips, a primal cry of anguish. 
"Sarah... You're utterly pitiful," Megan's voice followed, punctuated by mocking laughter. 
Amidst all the noise, I heard a baby crying. "Mommy..." 
"Ahhhh!" My cry joined the chorus as tears streamed uncontrollably down my cheeks, unable to contain the depths of my sorrow. I curled into myself, clutching my knees as the weight of despair pressed down upon me. 
My chest felt like it was being crushed, struggling against invisible hands tightening around my lungs. Panic clawed at me as I gasped for air, but it was like trying to grasp smoke. This wasn't like before, when I could reign in the chaos within me.  
This was a tidal wave of helplessness crashing over me. 
"H-help," the word escaped my lips in a strangled plea, barely audible even to myself. 
It felt like I was sinking deep into the ocean, the pressure building up with every moment. I reached out for air, longing for relief from the overwhelming darkness. 
'I need air! I need-' 
As the door swung open, a flood of blinding light poured into the room, searing my eyes with intensity. 
"Madam Sarah!" Their voices reached me, but their faces blurred.  
As darkness surrounded me, I saw Alex and Josh one last time, but their faces were fading away...
###chapter 30: Unexpected Duty 
**Sarah** 

Josh's face greeted me as I regained consciousness, finding myself already on the bed with the IV line removed from my arm. It hung empty, prompting my fearful inquiry, "What did you inject me with?" 
"It's a sedative to calm you down," Josh replied, his tone soothing yet tinged with concern. 
Alex stood behind him, his expression solemn, bearing witness to the tense exchange. 
"I sacrificed my job to save you. I hope you won't think badly of me," Josh explained earnestly. 
"Are you okay, Madam Sarah?" Assistant Alex interjected, unable to withstand his silence. 
"Leave me alone with Josh," I demanded, gaze piercing through the room, fixating on Philip's bodyguard. 
The assistant hesitated, apprehensive of the implications. "I can't do that! I'll be accountable to Boss Philip!" 
My frustration boiled over, directed squarely at Alex. "Damn you, Alex! Philip just jeopardized my life, and you dare to prioritize his demands over my safety! I have no relationship with Philip anymore! I couldn't care less about his opinions or your job obligations. Leave me alone with Josh!" My words sliced through the tension, my eyes delivering a silent warning as I directed my frustration squarely at the assistant. 
"I'll give you five minutes. Your conversation needs to be finished when the boss arrives," Alex instructed firmly. 
I held my tongue, locking eyes with Josh until the door clicked shut, leaving us alone in the room. With a deep breath, I voiced what had been weighing on me. 
"You're not a bodyguard, are you? That's not your real role here. You're a doctor, perhaps even a psychiatrist," I asserted, feeling my body quiver with the revelation. 
Josh's gaze narrowed thoughtfully. "I now see that you're perceptive, Madam Sarah." 
It all started to make sense, especially with the help of the investigation I had Jakob conduct. Earlier, while I was busy at the hospital, I tasked Jakob with uncovering information about Josh, particularly since he had accompanied me from Henderson to Highland Hills. 
Jakob: I couldn't trace the identity of that bodyguard named Josh. You said he's only been with Philip for six months? That's as long as his identity has been established. 
Me: If that's the case, why does he refuse to leave Philip's side? He mentioned having a mother with psychosis, which explains his familiarity with the medication I was taking... 
I thought Josh might need money for his mother, but he never actually said it. 
Jakob's words snapped me back to the present.  
Jakob: You must tread carefully, Sarah. Philip may have insight into the bodyguard's identity, or worse yet, he could be the one Josh is working on. 
Confronting Josh, I couldn't hold back my frustration. "Why did you deceive me? Does Philip know about this?" I demanded, my tone sharp with accusation. 
"For your safety, it's best you remain unaware. I assure you, I harbor no ill intentions towards you," Josh replied calmly. 
"I need your help!" Desperation crept into my voice. Maybe I'm crazy! Despite uncertainties, I was confident that Josh was my sole refuge in this predicament. "I require medical assistance, and I have full confidence in your ability to provide it." 
"No, Madam Sarah, that's-" Josh began, but I interrupted him. 
"I don't trust Philip or his friend doctor! I don't trust anyone in Highland Hills! If you were willing to help me before, why hesitate now?" I implored, my resolve unwavering. 
Josh hesitated, running a hand through his hair in frustration. "Fvck it! Fine! But we must ensure no one discovers what you've uncovered. And you must take responsibility for your recovery." 
I have several questions. What exactly is his role under Philip's authority, and why is he pretending to be a bodyguard? There's a twinge in my chest, worrying about my ex-husband potentially being Josh's target. 'No, Sarah! You shouldn't concern yourself anymore!' 
A knock interrupted my thoughts. "Madam Sarah. Please..." 
"Open the door but remain outside," I instructed. 
Josh acknowledged and proceeded to the door. But before he could turn the knob, I called out to him once more. 
"Josh... Thank you..." 
He exited, and Alex entered, his expression souring as he observed Josh's departure. 
"Boss Philip shouldn't be made aware of your private conversation here in the bedroom," Alex cautioned. 
"I have no relationship with Josh! Nor do I have any connection with your boss!" I retorted, my irritation palpable. 
"That's not what I'm implying, Madam Sarah. Can't you see? Boss Philip doesn't want you entangled with any man. It seems you fail to grasp it, but you hold a significant position in Boss Philip's life." 
"Enough with the nonsense, Alex. Your words only add to my headache," I snapped as the car's engine cut off outside Serenity Pines. 
"That must be the boss. Please, Madam Sarah, forgive him. He truly needs you right now," Alex pleaded. 
"My patience is wearing thin with you, Alex. Just leave me be!" I retorted, feeling increasingly irritable. 
I sank into the bed's soft embrace, deliberately turning my back from Philip's assistant. After a couple of minutes, the door creaked open. 
"Didn't I ask for some space?" I exclaimed as I spun around to face the door, only to find Philip standing there. 
Rage surged through my veins like a storm, consuming me in its fiery embrace. "Did you return to toss me back into the dark closet? Or did you return to ensure I wither away in there?" 
Philip's gaze darkened, but to my surprise, he swiftly joined me on the bed, embracing me tightly. His head nestled against my chest, seeking solace like a lost child. 
Confusion and frustration flooded my senses. What is this? I'm in the mood to confront him, but he shamelessly pulls me into a hug instead? 
"Let go of me!" I demanded. 
"Stop complaining," he countered. 
Curse him for smelling so irresistible! And curse him for setting my heart into a frenzy! 
"Do you think I've simply overlooked your earlier actions?" I confronted him. 
"I'm sorry..." His apology caught me off guard. "It's my fault for being the dumbest husband." 
My astonishment was palpable as I detected the sorrow laced within Philip's words. 
"You're impossible!" I couldn't resist remarking. Just hours ago, he was seething with anger, and now he's nestled against me like a koala. Philip's mood swings baffled me. 
He inflicted wounds upon my soul, yet he possessed the uncanny ability to soothe the uproar within me.

**Philip**  
Upon learning about Sarah's panic attack, I promptly drove to Serenity Pines. Exiting the car, I spotted Josh in the dimly lit garden, puffing on a cigar. Though irked by his presence, my focus remained on Sarah's well-being. 
Ascending to the room, I encountered Alex stationed by the door.  
"Boss! Glad you're here," he greeted, his expression fraught with concern. 
"How is Sarah?" I inquired, urgency lacing my words. 
"Madam's condition was critical earlier. Josh entered Serenity Pines and helped me take her out of the closet. Despite her distressing state, Josh provided invaluable assistance. He informed me that Madam Sarah had entrusted her medication to him, which prompted his decision to follow her into the villa," Alex elaborated. 
"I detest that bodyguard! Can we truly rely on the team's investigation about him?" I queried, my frustration evident. 
"I'll initiate another investigation," Alex assured, his resolve unwavering. 
I handpicked Josh from Mariano's team, but my satisfaction waned as he repeatedly defied my directives, yielding to Sarah's influence. While once a competent protector, his allegiance shifted upon my ex-wife's arrival. 
I stepped into the bedroom, meeting the gaze of my former spouse. My heart softened at the sight of her pale complexion, yet her ability to provoke anger surprised me.  
Sarah, my salvation! I couldn't bear the thought of her leaving Serenity Pines again. 
Closing the distance between us, I climbed onto the bed to embrace her, cherishing every moment of her presence. If only she realized the pain her actions caused me.  
Her milky scent soothed my nostrils, a gentle balm to the turbulence within my chest. Oh, how I yearned for Sarah to linger, to perceive me as her sole beacon in this vast world. With her by my side, tranquility enveloped us both until we surrendered to sleep, cocooned in each other's embrace. 
The following day, I brought Sarah to the office. 
"Why should I accompany you?" she queried with irritation. 
"As my secretary," I replied. 
"Since when? Besides, I'm already employed as Jakob's secretary!" 
"Regardless, hun. If you prefer to work under Jakob's authority, I won't stand in your way, but your presence should stay with me! That's our agreement." 
Sarah winced, perhaps too weary of arguing further, and reluctantly followed me.   
Later that afternoon, Alex informed me that my ex-secretary had visited the company building with my mother's assistance.
###chapter 31: Navigating the Chaos 
**Sarah** 

Engaging in debates with Philip is so draining that I'd rather maintain silence. I have my workload to focus on, and I'm not up for conversing with him. Yet, upon entering Philip's private office, I was swept back in time. Memories of the betrayal resurfaced when he cheated on his secretary. 
'Sara, you need to let go,' I reminded myself, attempting to purge those memories and the accompanying anguish. Seating myself on the couch opposite his expansive desk, I set up my laptop on the coffee table, focusing on anything but Philip's presence in the room. 
After a few minutes, Philip broke the silence. "Anything you need?" he inquired. 
"I need you to arrange my return to Henderson." 
He brushed off my request, instead instructing his assistant, "Please fetch your Madam's favorite snack." 
Meanwhile, a message popped up from Jakob. 
Jakob: So, you're planning to stay in Henderson? 
Me: Yes! My insane ex-husband is dead set on keeping me here. Boarding a plane feels impossible because I'm sure Philip will stop me at the airport. Please arrange to pick me up the day before Jessica's bridal party. 
The Cornell Family practically runs this city. 
Jakob: Why not take a private jet? 
Me: As if I have one. Just hitching a ride with friends (with a grin emoji.)  
Jakob: Fine! It's a long drive. I'm just not sure if you can escape your ex-husband. 
With a sudden creak, Philip's office door swung wide, revealing the formidable figure of my former mother-in-law. Behind her, like a shadow, trailed Megan. Our eyes met in a moment of tension and history. 
"What are you doing here?" Megan inquired. 
Madam Cornell gritted her teeth and then glanced at Philip. "Why is she here?" 
"She's working. Don't mind Sarah," Philip interjected, not breaking his focus on his laptop. 
As they bickered, I sent Jakob a message. 
***Me:*** *BRB. The monsters are here. I want to find out what Madam Cornell is up to. I know I can rely on you for that.* 
***Jakob:*** *I thought I was your boss? Why does it feel like the roles are reversed?* 
***Me:*** *I completed 50% of the game design, while you managed 20%. Do you want me to stop?* 
***Jakob:*** *Augh! You're not one to be underestimated. I'll deliver your ex-mother-in-law's report on a silver platter!* 
***Me:*** *Perfect!*  
Megan's voice trembled with hurt as she confronted me. "You left me at the event because of Sarah?"  
I closed my laptop with a sigh, rising from my seat. "I need some air. It seems like quite the family gathering is happening here." 
Madam Cornell's sharp retort pierced the tense atmosphere. "That's right, you should keep your distance from my son!" 
"Mom!" Philip interjected, attempting to diffuse the escalating tension. 
Madam Cornell softened her tone, addressing Philip directly. "Son, this woman is unstable! Why would you believe her? Megan told me you left her at the event, and now we find out you were with Sarah?" 
"Don't make it seem I'm irresistible enough to snatch Philip's gaze away from Megan," I quipped. "But then again..." I shot Megan a playful glance, subtly asserting my allure and youthfulness! 
I realized then that I couldn't avoid these two women. Madam Cornell had even meddled with my medication, a clear attempt on my life. So, my strategy became clear: to confront them until they were the ones avoiding me. 
Megan's face flushed with anger. "You're shameless bitch!" 
"Megan, please," Philip interjected with a note of frustration. 
"It's Sarah's fault, Philip! She insulted me," Megan added tearfully, further stoking my ex-husband's ire. 
I made my way to the door, exiting Philip's office. Let them bicker all they want. Outside, I found Philip's new secretary at her desk. 
"Excuse me, is there a quiet conference room available that I could use?" I inquired of the secretary. 
She informed me, "Yes, you can utilize that conference room. The boss occasionally occupies it." 
"Thank you," I acknowledged. 
Following the secretary's directions, I went to the designated conference room and resumed my work undisturbed. 
After a few minutes, the door creaked open, revealing Philip's uncle, a distant relative of Mr. Cornell. On numerous occasions, when I attended gatherings with Philip, I noticed this uncle's unwelcome stares directed at me. 
"So, it appears you've returned," he remarked, his tone laden with insinuation. 
"I suggest you leave the room," I retorted firmly, refusing to entertain his implications. 
His tongue circled his lips, and he ignored what I said. "Are you back because you need money? How about I'll give it to you? Just let me fvck you for at least a night!" 
I was horrified by his words. 
"Uncle, it's best if you leave, or Philip will find out! This room is private, and I'm occupying it!" 
"Philip instructed me to touch you, my dear! I've been longing for you for so long, you know?" 
I couldn't figure out if what he said was true or not. Frankly, given the extent of the wrongs Philip had committed against me, I wasn't sure if I could fully trust him. That realization fueled my anger and heightened my resolve. 
Philip's uncle tried to touch me, but my mind quickly kicked into gear. I grabbed the laptop and slammed it against his head, not wanting to repeat the incident at the motel-my encounter with a man with foul breath almost taking advantage of me. 
"Ahh! Ahh! You bitch!" Philip's uncle screamed, clutching his head and collapsing onto the table. 
With the laptop still in hand, I struck him once more, fueled by anger and adrenaline. 
"Ahhh!" I delivered a kick to his most vulnerable spot, eliciting another agonized cry. He was torn between the pain in his head and his masculinity. 
I seized Philip's uncle by the hair and swiftly opened the door, drawing employees' attention in the hallway. Heads peeked out from nearby rooms to witness the scene unfold as I escorted Philip's uncle out of the conference room, not giving him a chance to retaliate. 
I'm curious about the extent of Philip's involvement in this scheme. My ex is an insufferable control freak, so I'm naturally skeptical of his uncle's claims. 
"Madam Sarah!" Assistant Alex exclaimed in shock as he spotted me approaching. 
Philip and two women emerged from the private office upon hearing the commotion. 
"What's going on?!" Philip's voice thundered, his gaze sweeping the office. Given his role as president, I could sense his concern. 
"That's precisely what I'm trying to figure out," I said, pushing his uncle forward to Philip's feet.  
"Philip, you have to help me! Sarah suddenly attacked me. I simply went to check on her in the conference room, and she suddenly lost it!" Philip's uncle complained. 
"I've been warning you, Philip! That woman is unhinged!" 
"Ow, ow! My head is pounding! Do something, Philip! She... she assaulted me!" his uncle whimpered, clutching his head in pain. 
Philip's expression soured, his eyes shadowed with frustration. Meanwhile, Megan wore a smug smirk, eagerly anticipating my response to the situation. 
"Are you absolutely certain? Positive I've caused me harm without cause?" I challenged Philip's uncle; my voice edged with incredulity. 
"Sarah was attempting to seduce me, and when I didn't comply, she became furious!" the uncle added, spinning more falsehoods. 
Megan's smirk widened while Madam Cornell shook her head in disbelief. 
I countered sharply, "Firstly, you resemble an unkempt ape who hasn't seen a bath in ten months! Who in their right mind would even entertain the thought of seducing you, let alone get angry over your rejection? No, the real question is, who would willingly choose to be with you?"  
With a surge of anger, I snatched up the fallen laptop, fully intending to strike the scoundrel again. My frustration was boiling over. 
"Madam Sarah, p-please, you must calm yourself," Alex pleaded desperately. 
"She's completely devoid of etiquette! Utterly lacking in education!" Madam Cornell added with a disparaging shake of her head. 
"Ha! I have evidence! I recorded every moment in that conference room on my laptop!" I proclaimed defiantly. 
Philip's uncle's eyes widened in disbelief. "Y-you're bluffing! Prove it! Show us! Show Philip the evidence you claim to have. Present your laptop, even though it's damaged from your earlier attack!" he challenged, pointing towards my laptop with its exposed wires. 
"Philip, we must address the situation with that woman immediately. Her presence is damaging our family's reputation," Madam Cornell urged, her tone firm. 
With a swift motion, I reached into my pocket, retrieved my phone, and tapped the play button to initiate the recorded message I had set up on my laptop. As the recording played for everyone present, I explained, "You may have assumed my laptop was destroyed, but fortunately, my phone's files are synced. I recorded this the moment you entered the conference room." 
The revelation echoed through the floor, prompting Philip's uncle to tremble with fear visibly. 
"Philip, listen..." he stammered, his voice tinged with panic. "It wasn't me. It was Madam Cornell, your mother. She's the one who instructed me to take advantage of Sarah!"
###chapter 32: Secretary’s Scheme 
**Sarah** 

Madam Cornell's hand met Philip's uncle's cheek with a resounding slap, her anger palpable as she vehemently denied his accusations. 
"Liar! You dare to accuse me just because you hear that I'm siding with you! Philip, didn't it even occur to you that Sarah's evidence might be fake? She's a manipulating schemer! She'll stoop to any level just to evade accountability and worm her way back into our family!" Madam Cornell's words dripped with venom as she defended herself. 
I could only shake my head in disbelief at her outburst. "Madam Cornell, do you think I'm a magician? Did I suddenly conjure up evidence in such a short time?" 
Megan stepped forward, attempting to mediate. "Philip, trust-" 
Philip yanked his arm away from Megan's grasp, his eyes blazing with fury. 
"There's a surveillance camera in that conference room. We'll eventually uncover the truth behind the evidence I presented." 
Philip ground his teeth as he confronted his uncle. "You're fired! You're not contributing to the company's success, yet you stirred up trouble!" 
The chaos shattered the screen of my laptop. I no longer cared whether Philip believed his mother and uncle's accusations.  
Yet, as I gazed upon Madam Cornell's quivering form, a silent witness to her unraveling composure, I sensed a sinister determination. It felt like she couldn't handle the fact that her evil plan against me didn't work. I could feel her desperation, showing how far she'd go to get rid of me. She was determined to ensure I disappeared completely, as if I never existed in their world. 
I entered the elevator, cradling my broken laptop in my arms, frustration bubbling inside me like a simmering volcano. 
"Sarah, where do you think you're going? Get back here!" Philip's voice echoed down the hallway. 
My response was a defiant gesture; middle finger raised in the air, silently conveying my frustration with him and his entire family. I'm so over with the Cornell family! 
As the elevator doors closed, I glimpsed Philip angrily gritting his teeth. My chest tightened with a potent mix of rage and resentment. 
'Sht! My expensive laptop!' Only then did I fully comprehend the extent of the damage. Tears threatened to spill as I surveyed the broken device, a casualty of my impulsive outburst. 
'Why on earth did you use a laptop to lash out at his uncle, of all things, Sarah? There were plenty of other options in that conference room. You could have grabbed a swivel chair!' I muttered to myself, realizing the repercussions of my actions. Work would grind to a halt without a functioning computer, and replacing it was a complex task. 
Exiting the elevator cabin into the lobby, I'm unsure of my next move. 
"I told you, your boss is my baby daddy! Why won't anyone believe me?!" The commotion in the lobby drew my attention, and I spotted Philip's former secretary engaged in a heated exchange with the front desk staff. 
Our eyes met briefly, and a sly smirk tugged at the corner of her lips. I felt a surge of anger, my fists clenching at my sides as I noticed her swollen belly. She was pregnant, and it seemed she was nearing her due date. 
Philip's ex-secretary left the front desk and approached me. 
"I need to talk to your husband," she began. 
Tension crackled between us. Why was she pregnant? Was Philip the father? Panic clenched my chest, making it hard to breathe. Should I cry? Why was her belly growing while my child had been taken from me mercilessly? 
'Sarah, focus!' I urged myself. 
The secretary's words were a blur, drowned out by the ringing in my ears and the encroaching darkness in my vision. 
'I'm pregnant' Her voice was barely audible, and I felt myself faltering. 
These panic attacks are getting on my nerves! I had to push through! 
Strong arms enveloped me, quieting the storm of emotions. The familiar scent of his chest calmed my nerves. 
*** 
**Philip**  

"Oh, my goodness, is it true? Did Madam Cornell really instruct that man to exploit the president's ex-wife?" 
"How could Madam Cornell stoop to such a level?" 
"I heard that man assaulted a talent!" 
"Yes, I remember now! He's the one currently facing sexual assault charges from newcomers. The latest victim is a top-tier star!" 
Those were the murmurs circulating, and I was displeased. Assistant Alex promptly put an end to them. 
"Enough of this chatter! Is this what the company pays you for? To spread rumors?" 
The employees' cheeks flushed with embarrassment as they redirected their attention to their tasks, purposefully avoiding the commotion. 
"That man is a liar! Don't trust him, Philip!" Suddenly, my mother felt weak. "Oh dear, my vision is fading. Someone, call a doctor. Quickly!" 
"Madam Cornell!" Megan rushed to support my mother as she collapsed. 
I confronted Uncle, and he understood what was coming next as I shot him a stern look. Following the incident involving rookie talents last month, this individual had been suspended from work. 
Uncle claimed that he was lured by the talent at the bar, and the legal proceedings are still ongoing. The company is working to contain the situation and prevent it from escalating further. I've spoken with the talent, and we're working on calming her down. Given the potential impact on the company's reputation, we take every possible measure. 
"Alex, please escort Madam Cornel home. It seems her blood pressure is rising, and she should rest," I instructed firmly. 
"Understood, boss!" 
I followed Sarah, taking the same elevator she had used.  
"Philip!" Despite Megan's irritating call, I pressed the close button. 
Three individuals waiting outside were taken aback as the elevator doors reopened on a passing floor. Among them was an A-list star accompanied by two assistants. They were about to enter when I intervened. "Please use the other lift." 
Upon reaching the lobby, I noticed Sarah facing my former secretary, who appeared to be confronting her with folded arms. Sarah seemed to be in distress, clutching her chest and struggling to breathe. 
Reacting quickly, I pulled Sarah into my embrace, shooting a pointed glare at my ex-secretary. 
"P-President Cornell, please, I just need to talk to you. I sought Madam Sarah's help." 
"Leave Sarah alone!" 
Sarah shoved me aside, her complexion drained of all color. "Speak to your secretary. It seems like you both need to have a conversation." 
Her eyes welled with tears, leaving me bewildered. 
I turned to the secretary, demanding answers. "Did you hurt her?!"  
"N-no!" 
Attempting to compose myself, I struggled to determine whom to address first. I aimed to resolve the issue with my former secretary, eager to prevent unwarranted trouble yet equally concerned for Sarah's well-being. 
Then Josh approached. My expression soured at the sight of him. Alex had mentioned that Josh was temporarily assigned to Luminary Productions' building. 
"Boss, I'll escort Madam Sarah to the clinic," Josh offered. 
"I'd rather not draw attention, Philip! Address the issue with your secretary," Sarah interjected. 
But in that heartbeat, my heart led the way. I yearned for Sarah to grasp the depth of my unwavering devotion. I don't care about my ex-secretary or whoever! 
I drew her close into my arms once more, fingers gently cradling the back of her neck while my other hand tenderly caressed her cheeks. Finally, our lips met in an emotional embrace. 
I sensed her surprise at that moment. Gasps echoed around us, and cameras clicked as Sarah and I exchanged kisses in the expansive lobby. The location didn't matter; all I craved was the taste of her lips. 
"Is that President Cornell?" 
"Oi, My goodness! It's so romantic!" 
"Who's the woman with him?" 
Amidst the questions, I ensured Sarah relished every moment of my affection. Security personnel encircled us, with Alex at the forefront.  
His voice commanded attention, clarifying, "This is merely a performance, folks! It's all part of a commercial show. Any photos taken must be deleted immediately, or we'll be forced to take legal action if they're posted online!" 
"Ahh, that explains it." 
"But why stage it here, in the main building, instead of on set?" 
Releasing my former wife's lips, I noticed Megan. I barely registered the emotions playing across her face. 
"You're an absolute prick!" Sarah spat out; her composure regained after a panic attack, her anger palpable as if the previous moment of breathlessness hadn't occurred. 
A smirk played on my lips. "Babe, I think I'm the remedy you're looking for. Your panic attacks always disappear whenever I teach you a lesson. Admit it, you enjoy kissing me." 
"You're a delusional scumbag! You impregnated your secretary!" 
Hang on! My mind raced, confusion and speechlessness seizing me in their grip.
###chapter 33: Seed of Doubt 
**Sarah**  
Philip massaged his temples, a sign of growing confusion. "Do you really believe I impregnated my secretary?"  
That's correct! But I'm not interested in entertaining Philip any longer. I need to distance myself from him; he and his family are giving me a headache.  
"Boss..." Assistant Alex murmured into my ex-husband's ear. Philip's expression soured as he absorbed the news.  
I was taken aback when Philip grabbed my arm, pulling me along.  
"Where are we going?" I asked, bewildered.  
Ignoring my inquiries, Philip seized my arm and led me down a narrow path flanked by dense bushes. The absence of other souls suggested seclusion. Dim lights intermittently dotted the path, casting eerie shadows. With each step, my confusion deepened, and I became clueless about Philip's destination.  
"Philip, what's going on? Where are we headed?" I couldn't contain my unease.  
"Shhh. We're at LM's Garden. Keep quiet," Philip whispered. "Not a sound, not even a rustle."  
His response sent a shiver down my spine. What was this about? As I followed him, various unsettling thoughts raced through my mind, evoking images of Fifty Shades of Grey and its infamous red room.  
My cheeks burned with the tumult of thoughts whirling in my mind.   
"Philip-" His hand quickly covered my mouth, his lips hovering close to my ear. The warmth of his breath almost scorched against my skin, causing my lips to tremble.   
"I said, be quiet" he whispered, his presence pressing against me from behind, his hold firm around my waist, his manhood making its presence known.   
Damn, these sensations! It's overwhelming!  
We froze at the sound of approaching voices, two figures engaged in argument.  
"Why did you even come here?!" It was Philip's uncle, his voice harsh as he lit a cigarette.  
"Boss, I need support! I need money!" The secretary's voice trembled with desperation.  
With a swift motion, Philip's uncle slapped the secretary's face, her cries piercing the air as she crumpled to the ground.  
"It's your fault! I entrusted you to Philip to uncover his plans, but instead, he's become president, and you're shamelessly pregnant!" Philip's uncle's rage was palpable as he kicked the woman.  
My hand flew to my mouth, a fierce blaze of fury erupting in my chest. While part of me harbored frustration towards the secretary, witnessing a pregnant woman being harmed by Philip's uncle was something I couldn't tolerate.  
When I attempted to approach them, Philip halted me with a firm grip. He whispered, "I explicitly instructed you to stay silent," his tone chillingly devoid of warmth.   
Philip's anger radiated palpably, causing me to clench my fist and bite my lip in compliance with his demand.  
"You've got some nerve, you shameless jerk! I did everything you asked and look where it got me! You're the reason my life's in shambles! I lost my job because of you! What about our child?" The secretary lamented tearfully, regretting the day she crossed paths with Philip's uncle.  
"This is exasperating! It's your fault for getting pregnant! I don't have any offspring with you, you despicable woman! It's your responsibility to proceed with the pregnancy! Do you believe you can extort money from me, expecting me to support you when you conceive?"   
As tension radiated from Philip's hand firmly wrapped around my waist, I closed my lips, pondering if Philip's anguish stemmed from the realization that he wasn't the father of the secretary's unborn child.  
'Sarah, what absurd thoughts are you entertaining?'  
His uncle interjected irritably, "You should consider yourself fortunate that I even entertained you, considering Philip wouldn't even glance your way!"  
The secretary could only weep in her current predicament, lamenting, "I wish I'd never met you!"  
"The Timing couldn't be more perfect! I'm now jobless, too! Do you still wish to be with me? You were the one supporting me!" Philip's uncle proposed, seizing the opportunity to be a slacker.  
"Wait, you're saying you don't have a job? What about our child?" the secretary asked, her confusion evident.  
"Can we cut the drama? I know Madam Cornell sent you to cause trouble earlier! How much is she paying you?"   
"Madam Cornell simply allowed me to come in and stir up problems for President Cornell's ex-wife," the secretary clarified. "She believes I had a relationship with her husband."  
"Fine! Let's exploit your pregnancy to squeeze money out of that useless woman!" Philip's uncle interjected angrily. "I couldn't believe she slapped me! That shameless bitch!"  
I narrowed my eyes at that comment, feeling the tension in Philip's body. Was he angry at the comment?  
"Absolutely! She's just a clueless wife! She didn't even finish college!"   
I shook my head in disbelief. Did they seriously think they could extort money from me? How?  
"Now, it's your call on what you want to do! Tss! You're an eyesore!" The uncle's eyes flashed with disdain at the pregnant woman as he departed, flicking his cigarette butt. The crying secretary trailed behind him.  
After a while, Philip and I emerged from our hiding spot in the thick bushes. He still hadn't let go of his arm around my waist. With his comforting presence, my racing mind gradually quieted after I had absorbed everything.  
"Are we clear now? Have you heard enough explanation? I didn't impregnate that secretary! Are you seriously entertaining the idea that I had a relationship with her?" Philip accused, firing off questions.  
"It doesn't matter anymore," I replied tersely.  
I couldn't muster the energy to discuss it further. It seemed futile, considering I had no intention of reconciling or rekindling anything with him. Despite this, a small sense of relief settled within me.  
"I need to get my laptop fixed! Shit! What am I going to do? It's so frustratingly expensive!" I lamented, on the verge of tears, my focus shifting back to the device in my hands.  
His expression soured, but he refrained from further argument. I was caught off guard when his lips met mine, delivering a punishing kiss.  
***  
**Philip**   
I'm so annoyed! After I showed Sarah the truth, she cared more about her broken laptop. I kissed her lips hard, diverting her attention. After I gave her a mind-blowing, extraordinary, cum-inducing kiss, her laptop fell onto the cement.  
"Sh*t!" Sarah angrily exclaimed, picking up the device. Her cheeks were hot in embarrassment. "You are the dumbest-perv president I've ever known!"  
"Don't act cute, babe! You didn't hold onto your laptop because you were swooning from my kiss," I said, smirking.  
"Who said I was swooning? It's okay to be a 'delulu', Philip! You stole a kiss!" she cried, examining the laptop. Her flushed cheeks were genuinely adorable!  
"Give me that! I'll get it repaired," I suggested, reaching for the laptop, but she dodged it.  
"No chance! Everything on this laptop is confidential! I have to take it back to Henderson."  
"That's not happening, babe! I won't allow you to return to BM Technologies." Jakob, Bronn Martin, and Amir were all there, sticking close around to Sarah. I won't allow a repeat of what happened between us.  
Suddenly, memories of Sarah's baby from last year flooded my mind. I clasped her fiercely, my grip tightening to anchor her in place. The weight of blame settled heavily upon me, a burden I couldn't shake. 
Last year, I didn't pay much attention to Sarah, which may have led to her distancing herself from me.   
I brought her back to Serenity Pines Estate. To my relief, she seemed relaxed, lounging like a contented squirrel on the plush bed. Frankly, I felt comforted by her calmness, much better than the idea of her looking for attention from other men. 
After a long while, I received a message from my mother.  
Mother: Philip, your actions are hurting Megan. Why is Sarah staying at Serenity Pines now? Get her out!  
I chose not to engage with her control tactics; it's a trait I unfortunately have inherited.  
As the afternoon rolled in, Alex delivered urgent news: "Boss, Madam Sarah's guard just informed me that Madam Cornell and Ms. Megan have arrived at Serenity Pines Estate."  
"Prepare the car immediately. We need to leave at once!"
###chapter 34: Unfazed 
**Sarah**  

I'm having a leisurely day here at Serenity Pines Estate.  
I spent some time playing "Death Marriage" on the same computer I used when Philip and I were married, reminiscing about old times in the computer and game room. If gaming didn't suit my mood, I contemplated ordering my favorite meal from Highland Hills or indulging in well-deserved rest. 
Today, I've chosen to take it easy, letting Philip handle his affairs while I focus on enjoying myself. There's no point in dwelling on problems that no longer concern me. 
As I sat in the kitchen, savoring a strawberry milkshake, the tranquility was interrupted by the arrival of Madam Cornell and Megan. Their presence didn't surprise me; it was evident they came with ill intentions, likely to stir up trouble in Philip's absence. 
Madam Cornell wasted no time in expressing her disdain for my presence. "You have the nerve to stay here at Serenity Pines despite no longer being married to Philip. Leave at once!" 
Ignoring their hostility, I calmly continued to enjoy my milkshake.  
"Are you hard of hearing?" she jest, raising her voice at my insistence. 
"Madam Cornell, do try to keep your temper in check. You wouldn't want those wrinkles to deepen any further. It'd be a shame to waste all that effort on your buttocks!" my simple comment. 
Her reaction was predictable; she was seething with rage. "You shameless woman! Leave Serenity Pines immediately! My son has already expelled you, yet you dare to return!" 
"Madam Cornell, please, let's all take a moment to calm down," Megan implored, her voice trembling with emotion as she struggled to comprehend my presence in the villa.  
I couldn't help but shake my head at the unfolding drama between these two women. 
"Megan, you're far too generous to that uneducated woman!" Madam Cornell snapped, summoning the guards from the Cornell Mansion. "Escort her out immediately! She has no right to be here at Serenity Pines." 
But before her guards could heed her command, they found their path obstructed by a formidable figure-Philip's steadfast bodyguard, Trey, whose loyalty was as unwavering as his imposing presence. 
"I apologize, Madam Cornell, but I cannot dismiss Madam Sarah," the guard asserted respectfully. 
"Madam Sarah?" My former mother-in-law's voice dripped with venom as she gritted her teeth in disbelief. 
"Are you, too, falling under her spell, Trey? I've been warning everyone: Sarah has a way of ensnaring anyone she pleases! Why don't you just follow Madam Cornell?" Megan's words dripped with suspicion and frustration. 
I couldn't help but roll my eyes at that comment. 
"I'm merely following the directives I've been given," Trey replied resolutely. 
"And who issued these directives to you?" Madam Cornell demanded. 
"I did!" Philip stormed into the dimly lit kitchen, his tone brimming with frustration. "What's going on? Why are you here?" he demanded, his anger palpable. 
"Philip, you know Sarah's presence will hurt Megan! Sarah is just trying to seduce you; that's why you're not thinking straight right now. Get rid of that woman!" Madam Cornell's words sliced through the tension. 
"Me?" I was rendered speechless by Madam Cornell's accusation. If anyone was attempting to seduce anyone, it was that fox Philip, not me! I had no intention of seducing him! He's the one who keeps stealing kisses from me! 
"Yes, you, you little brat! Can't you see what that woman is doing, Philip? She's just lounging around in her pajamas. Obviously, she hasn't done anything except laze around in this villa! All she does is drink milkshakes! That's her attitude!" 
I nodded simply, resigned to the fact that my mother-in-law was used to bossing me around in Serenity Pines. But that was then-when I was still Philip's wife. Now, I don't care about the world! 
"Mother, whatever Sarah does here in Serenity Pines, she doesn't need to explain to anyone. She's staying here, and that's not your problem!" Philip's voice carried authority, his patience wearing thin. 
Madam Cornell gritted her teeth in frustration. "I'll report her to the police if you don't get her out now! She has no right to this property because you're no longer married!" 
I remained silent, observing the escalating argument between mother and son while calmly sipping and finishing my milkshake. It felt like watching a drama unfold in a high-definition theater. 
Philip's anger reached a boiling point, his eyes narrowing at Madam Cornell's threat. 
"I'll call the police, Philip!" Madam Cornell threatened, her voice sharp with anger. 
"Do it! Yeah, why didn't I think of that before?" Philip commented sarcastically before lifting his mobile phone to make a call. "Alex, tell my lawyer to transfer Serenity Pines property to Sarah Mitchell's name!" 
I choked and spat out the milkshake in my mouth. 'What?' 
I thought their mother-son drama was solely their own. How did I become entangled in it? 
Philip continued, his tone dripping with contempt, "You are questioning the ownership of Serenity Pines. I'll give it to Sarah! Maybe that way, you'll understand and won't bother my wife anymore!" 
"Ex!" I interjected sharply, correcting his misconception about our relationship, but Philip disregarded it. 
Megan and Madam Cornell's eyes widened dramatically in sheer disbelief. 
Philip's mother turned to me, her voice trembling with fury. "Y-you! You're the plague in my son's life! You, uneducated woman!" 
I could see in Megan's face that she wanted to strangle me, but she tried to calm herself. "M-Madam Cornell, please calm down. Maybe Philip isn't thinking straight at the moment." 
Philip sneered. "Megan, I'm the president of a multimillion-dollar company. Are you suggesting that I make decisions impulsively? Are you implying that I'm not thinking clearly?" 
"N-No, Philip. That's not what I meant" Megan replied tearfully. 
"Sarah will be the owner of Serenity Pines Estate, so if you two are planning to go here, you need to ask permission from her!" Philip reiterated sternly. 
The sound of my dwindling milkshake crackling in the glass filled the room, followed by an untimely burp escaping my lips. Philip and Trey were left speechless, while Megan and Madam Cornell showed obvious disgust. 
"She really has no manners!" Madam Cornell remarked with disdain. 
"If that's all, Mother, you are free to go," Philip commented, dismissing her. 
"This is not the end!" Madam Cornell declared defiantly as she stormed out. She was followed by Megan, who left with tears in her eyes and cast a glance back at me. 
In the aftermath of the confrontation, I felt a sense of satisfaction. I had considered confronting Madam Cornell to end her meddling, and now I had proven it was the right course of action. She had aimed to remove me from Serenity Pines, but instead, ownership of the property would soon be mine. 
I couldn't forget how she had tried to sabotage my medication, treating me like a psychopath while attempting to harm me with those drugs. 
With the drama concluded, I longed to retreat to the solace of my bedroom. Sleep seemed a far more appealing prospect than dwelling on my problems. 
"Where are you going?" Philip questioned, blocking my path. 
"To sleep."  
"No, you're coming with me," Philip insisted. "It's Auntie Marietta's birthday, and she's expecting me to come. Jane will surely be there too. She'll arrive tonight from London." 
My eyes lit up at the news. "Jane is coming home?" 
I swiftly retrieved my phone from my onesie pajamas and confirmed Jane's message. She had completed her studies and, as far as I knew, had applied for a position at Luminary Productions. 
Jane: Love, I'm heading home to Highland Hills. Brother Philip mentioned you're at Serenity Pines. See you soon! 
I could only close my mouth in disbelief at the message. I was filled with excitement about seeing Jane again. 
Another notification chimed on my phone. It was a message from Jakob. 
Jakob: I'm leaving Henderson. See you later! 
I quickly counted the days I had spent at Serenity Pines. Right! Tonight marked the agreement between Jakob and me. Tonight, he would rescue the princess from the clutches of the big bad wolf named Philip. 
The brute shamelessly trailed behind me when I entered the room, even stealing a kiss.  
Later, as I showered, I caught sight of him at the foot of the bed, unclothed, holding his huge hard shaft, his gaze intense. 
Instinct urged me back to the shower, hoping to cleanse away the unsettling image, yet Philip embodied a magnetism I couldn't ignore. After all, he was the sole man who ignited my insanity. 
"Care to lend a hand?" he murmured, his tone laced with darkness, shattering any semblance of reason within me.
###chapter 35: Dance of Desire 
**Philip**  

I'm at my wit's end.   
Sarah nonchalantly sipped on her milkshake, igniting an unexpected thirst within me. I want to suck my tongue inside her mouth, to taste what's inside there. Following her into the bedroom, I found remnants of the milkshake glistening on her lips, tempting me like a thief drawn to treasures.  
"Ehhhm!" As I indulged my desire, Sarah pushed me away with a firm rebuke, her cheeks flushed with irritation. 
"You're really pushing the boundaries of your lustfulness! You, pervert!" she admonished. 
Unable to resist, I confessed, "I can't help it. I want to taste what's within your mouth." 
Her cheeks reddened further as she countered, "What if it's another man's cum, huh?" 
Unsure how to respond to her provocative remark, I found it, blaugh, distasteful.  
"You mean my own?" I quipped. 
"Philip, you're disgusting!" Sarah's cheeks reddened further. "Are you seriously suggesting you want to taste your own... cum?" 
Though her words should have deterred me, they only fueled my desire. "Does that mean you want it in your mouth, Sarah?" I teased, leaning in closer. 
"W-who said that?! You're shameless!" Sarah protested, swiftly changing the subject. 
But my desire remained unabated; I became hard just to think about the scenario of my cum inside her mouth.   
Yet, Sarah swiftly changed the subject, her annoyance evident. "Get out! I'll remove clothes!" 
"Babe, as if I haven't seen you naked before. Or perhaps you want me to lend a hand?" I teased, earning only a glare in response. 
This little devil isn't kidding around! She unzipped her onesie from neck to waist, unveiling her two round breasts. My heart skipped a beat as I admired her perky chest, aching to reach and touch them, aching my mouth tasting them. But she wasn't done yet. With a sensual grace, she wriggled out of the garment until only a pair of panties adorned her. 
With flushed cheeks, she teased, "Yeah, right! You've seen it. So, freeze with desire!" 
Her perky round chest swayed gently as she gracefully went to the bathroom, catching my attention. But as quickly as she appeared, she offered a tantalizing glimpse before disappearing. Her ass, reminiscent of orbs, playfully moved out of reach. 
I was totally about to embark on a sneaky adventure, trailing after her, but my intentions were thwarted by the evil queen's daughter, who slammed the door shut before I could reach them. Despite my efforts to open it, Sarah had already locked it from the inside. 
Damn, that naughty little minx! 
When I peeked inside my trousers, my cock was throbbing, swollen with anger. He's surely taken offense! I did what was necessary to soothe him, paying no heed to the world around me. I must tend to this. 
*** 
**Sarah** 
With a blush tinting my cheeks, I slipped beneath the refreshing cascade of the cool shower, trying to wash away the lingering intensity of Philip's gaze. It felt like he was trying to devour me whole with those eyes of his! His longing to caress my ass was practically written all over his face. 
'Oh, that man!' 
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake off Philip's influence over my sensuality. 
Snatching up the robe hanging nearby, I wrapped it around myself, stealing a moment to listen for any signs of movement beyond the door before cautiously unlocking it. 
'Okay, I'm safe!' 
But in that charged atmosphere, the concept of safety seemed about as stable as a soap bubble. 
I mentally cursed my ex-husband as I passed the inviting expanse of the bed towards the wardrobe. There he was, sitting in the corner with that infuriating smirk, his gaze fixed on me as if he had all the time in the world, leisurely stroking his cock. 
"Care to lend a hand?" Philip's voice cut through the tension. I wanted to quip back, to keep up our usual banter, but Philip's aura of dominance was palpable, his gaze piercing through me like a king sizing up his prey. 
My mind scattered as I approached him, sinking to my knees before him. Memories flooded my mind of a time when I craved his touch more than anything else. 
With one hand enveloping his thick, impressive girth, I stroked it gently, meeting Philip's gaze with the reverence of a devoted servant. 
His touch was a tender caress, weaving through the silken strands that framed my face, delicately guiding them to the curve of my neck, allowing him to behold my countenance in its entirety. I couldn't resist the allure of Adan's blessing!  
Every inch of him was perfection, from the gentle curve of his balls to the length of his manhood that I already imagined inside my mouth, touching the passage of my throat.    
With a glance at Philip, I continued my exploration, tracing a path with my tongue from the bottom, the girth, to the very tip of his being. As I took him into my mouth, squeezing him, savoring the taste of his essence, I felt a rush of desire unlike anything before. 
"Ahhh, fvck, Sarah!" He grunted and caressed my cheeks, guiding me to insert all his length inside my wet mouth.   
Goodness! The thought of his cock inside my mouth is sending shivers down my spine, reaching every fiber of my being, clenching my reacting pussy muscle.  
Philip tenderly grasped my lips, offering comfort as my hand diligently continued its task.  "You are a piece of art, babe! You really do belong to me!"  he murmured. 
Like honey saucing Philip's penis, a spit from my mouth is gently running down towards his head.    
"Ahhh fvcking sexy!" he murmured.   
Any semblance of rationale I had harbored was swept away like leaves in the wind as I took Philip again into my mouth. With each motion, I enveloped him with a dance of push and pull, drawing him deeper, savoring the taste of his skin against my lips. My tongue danced along his length, eliciting a symphony of curses and hard grunts that echoed in the air. 
"Hmm Does it taste better, Sarah? Let me cum in your mouth!" he grunted darkly.  
My lips gripped his swollen shaft as he quickened his pace, his movements delving deeper, reaching the depths of my throat.  
Oh, how he ignited sensations beyond words! Lost in the bliss of his touch, my jaw surrendered to his fervent advances, numb to all but the ecstasy of the moment, until finally, I savored the salty and slimy release that filled my mouth. 
My heart raced as I pulled away from Philip to catch my breath. But the rascal! Even after I had tasted the essence of his being, he still managed to capture my lips in a fervent kiss. 
With nimble grace, he swiftly scooped me into his lap and effortlessly settled me onto him. In mere seconds, his skilled hands worked to untie my robe, eagerly seeking the treasure hidden beneath. 
My moan escaped inside his mouth as his fingers danced against my wetness.  
"I can no longer take it, Sarah! I want to fuck you!" His guttural sound, wanting me at that heated moment, sent an unexplainable desire into my pussy.   
Before my thoughts could align, his cock met my slit, sending a surge of warmth through my body, and it only took a second before my gaze widened as Philip skillfully entered my property.  
"Ahhh yes!" He closed his eyes, loving the refuge inside me.   
He fucked me from behind, as he snuggled me, as I faced the soft bed while clutching the pillow, or as I faced the wide mirror while seeing myself engulfing Philip's presence, or while Philip was thrusting his hips forward, making sure his shaft dominated me completely.  
During intimacy, Philip owns me!    
Highland Hills lay cloaked in darkness as he finished, yet he reminded me of our obligation to attend a party.  
I shouldn't go along; frankly, I'm not feeling up to it. The day had already drained me completely, especially after Philip repeatedly claimed me. 
"I just don't have the energy to go," I lamented to Philip. My relationship with his extended family wasn't exactly harmonious either. 
"But there's so much food there," he countered. 
"Still, I'm exhausted," I replied weakly, curling up with a pillow like a tired koala. 
"Let me take care of you. Remember, you promised to meet Jane," Philip urged, gently wiping away his remnants from my weary body. 
*** 
Philip and I headed to Garden Grove Cafe to celebrate his Auntie Marietta's birthday.  
"My auntie rented out the whole place. It's just family and close friends," Philip informed me. 
I shrugged. As soon as we arrived, it became apparent that I was the only one dressed casually. 
"Philip!" His cousins and uncles greeted him warmly, their eyes inadvertently landing on my simple denim skirt and black blouse. Though unspoken, their surprise was palpable.  
Despite an array of dresses hanging in my wardrobe, I had insisted on maintaining a somber appearance, a preference I hoped Philip had grown accustomed to by now. 
"Philip, why is she here?" Rebecca, Philip's cousin and friend of Megan, who is also Auntie Marietta's daughter and a celebrity with Luminary Productions, questioned upon seeing me. 
"I'm here for the food!" I replied nonchalantly, already salivating at the thought of the spread inside. 
Philip's cousins were speechless by my response. 
There's nothing in Serenity Pines that I crave right now. At least at this party, the options are limitless-there's an abundance of food to choose from! 
Philip exchanged a few words with his cousin while they stole glances at me. They seemed puzzled by my presence.  
Well, I'm puzzled, too! They're not alone! What on earth am I doing with my ex-husband, right? 
Turning to Philip, I declared, "I'm famished!" He invited me, so it's his job to feed me. 
"We're heading in," Philip announced, bidding farewell to his cousins. 
Philip guided me into the event hall as his cousins observed us with disbelief. Their remarks didn't escape my ears.  
"I thought Philip reconciled with Megan?" 
"Same here! Isn't he already divorced Sarah?" 
"And shit, that bitch! Megan is here!" remarked Rebecca, clearly irritated by my presence. 
But I never imagined that these women had planned to embarrass me at the event.
###chapter 36: Her Lobster Affair 
**Sarah**  

Philip graciously ushered me into the gathering, where all eyes immediately fixed upon me. Yet, my attention was only in one direction-the buffet! 
A passing waiter showcased a plate adorned with buttered lobster, its vibrant hue and alluring scent tantalizing my senses. My mouth watered at the mere thought of savoring it. 
"Hmm I want that!" I exclaimed, tugging at Philip's sleeve like an eager child, pointing towards the dish. 
He regarded me with a knowing gaze.  
"Why?" I inquired. 
"I didn't leave you hungry at Serenity Pines, did I? If I had known you were such a lobster enthusiast, I would've brought the head chef from this restaurant to the villa," he remarked.  
"Tsk!" For months, I had been shackled to a restrictive diet, convinced that my heart was frail and vulnerable. However, learning this wasn't the case, I felt liberated and eager to indulge in anything I wanted! 
Before I could respond, my former mother-in-law appeared, accompanied by Megan. 
"What's she doing here, Philip? That woman shows no regard for decency, dressed so inappropriately for this occasion! Do you wish to embarrass your aunt?" Madam Cornell's scolding tone resonated with disapproval. 
"Philip..." Megan choked out, her voice trembling with barely contained emotion. Her eyes held a storm of frustration as she turned to me, as if she could tear my hair out with her gaze alone. 
"She's not invited!" interjected my ex-mother-in-law sharply. 
Philip's father intervened, drawn by the commotion. In the dim lighting, he initially struggled to recognize me. "What's going on? We have guests, and it's not appropriate to have such a scene at the entrance." 
Madam Cornell's demeanor softened slightly. "Honey, I'm just reprimanding Sarah for her lack of respect towards Marietta. Not only did she show up without an invitation, but she dressed casually." 
"I invited her, Mom!" Philip asserted. 
Megan gritted her teeth in jealousy. 
"Good evening, Mr. Cornell," I greeted Philip's father as he turned towards me, disregarding the ladies. 
"Oh! Is this Sarah? It's been quite some time," he exclaimed, recognition dawning on him. 
Since I primarily spent time at Serenity Pines Estate during my marriage to Philip, I rarely interacted with the chairman outside of events like this. 
"Yes, I came when I heard Jane would return tonight," I explained. 
Philip's mother interjected, her irritation evident, "Your attire is still inappropriate!" 
A man approached Philip's father, whispering something in his ear. Mr. Cornell excused himself shortly after. "I need to leave for another meeting." 
"Honey... Are you leaving again?" Philip's mother clung to him; her voice tinged with disappointment. 
"I just happened to pass by," Mr. Cornell said casually. As he departed, he cast a menacing glance at his wife. 
"Philip!" Auntie Marietta approached us. 
"Happy birthday, Auntie. I came with-" Philip began. 
"It's good that you came!" Auntie Marietta interrupted, seemingly disregarding my presence. Did my appearance offend her delicate sensibilities, branding me as nothing more than a wandering tourist? "Anyway, everyone, please take a seat. I have an announcement to make." 
Philip's Auntie Marietta summoned an attendant with a request: Auntie Marietta summoned an attendant with a request, "Please escort Philip to his chair." 
Philip... only him... It's as if she didn't even see me. 
The attendant led us to one table, my mind drifting to my phone, hoping for a message from Jakob. 
We arrived at a VIP table where Philip's cousins, including Rebecca and Megan, were already seated. The air was charged with tension, particularly palpable due to my ex-husband's presence alongside me and Megan. 
"Philip, sit beside Megan," Rebecca suggested with a sneer directed at me. 
The round table brimmed with Philip's relatives, each seat claimed except for a solitary chair meant for Philip. 
Rebecca's smirk didn't escape my notice. 
"Where's Sarah's seat?" Philip inquired, furrowing his brow at the attendant. 
The man swallowed hard, growing visibly nervous. "S-she's not on the list, sir." 
I wasn't particularly bothered; after all, I hadn't been formally invited. I refused to let such matters bother me. However, I wanted to plop down because Philip had worn me out! My joints were screaming for a break, hence the involuntary yawn. 
"What now, Sarah? It seems all the tables are full, and I don't think there's a place for you," Rebecca remarked. 
I shrugged, multitasking by typing a message to Jakob. 
Me: Hey! What's up? 
"I'll ask Mom if there's a seat for Sarah," Rebecca offered, her lips curling up as she observed me texting. She probably perceived me as a lost kitten in need of rescue. 
Philip, meanwhile, casually placed his order with the attendant. "Okay! Bring a plate of your biggest lobster." 
'Yes! My lobster!' I wanted to cheer inwardly at the thought. 
Megan and Rebecca exchanged amused chuckles as the attendant departed to fulfill Philip's request.  
Philip gestured towards me, tapping his leg. "Sit here," he instructed. 
The smiles faded from both women's faces, and I couldn't help but suppress a laugh at their expressions. Feeling mischievous, I decided to tease Megan, so I settled onto Philip's lap. 
"Are you tired?" Philip asked lightly. 
I responded with an awkward smile, leaning close to Philip's ear. "Let's steer clear of discussing what happened earlier, shall we?"  
I pinched his cheek because deep down, I was still irked that he had managed to seduce me so easily! 
Philip's smirk widened. "Come on, you missed it. Admit it. You missed me. Especially my-" 
"Are you two back together?" Rebecca's pointed question cut through Philip's self-satisfied expression, much to my relief. It put an end to our flirtatious banter, at least momentarily. 
Philip's response was curt. "That's not your concern."  
Rebecca blushed, clearly embarrassed, while Megan's grip on the table tightened. 
"So, how's Mr. Benner? Didn't you go with him last year?" Megan casually inquired, her tone implying more than just curiosity. But I wasn't about to give her the satisfaction if she hinted that Amir was my lover. 
"Oh, he's doing well," I answered casually, sensing Philip's hand resting heavier on my waist. "He's-" 
Before I could finish, Philip leaned in and suck my ear. "Sarah, if I catch you even thinking about another man, you'll be in for a punishment next time." 
I glanced at Philip, raising an eyebrow. "And what kind of punishment would that be?" 
His smile turned suggestive. "I'll bite your clit!"  
I'm speechless. This brute!  
And the audacity of his cock, jerked in his pants.  
Because I was sitting on Philip's lap, I felt my throbbing clit, she prayed. 
"I won't! Men were the ones thinking about me," I remarked casually, reaching for the glass just set before Philip and taking a sip.  
The air crackled with tension as I caught the unmistakable glares of irritation from Megan and Rebecca, their expressions contorted with disdain, while the rest of the cousins at the table blushed under the weight of unspoken judgment. It seemed evident to me that, in their eyes, Philip and I were flirting. 
Before my mind could wander elsewhere, Philip's order was placed before us, and I couldn't help but clap in delight. I needed energy, especially since I planned to escape again tonight.  
This place wasn't for me; my job was at BM Technologies so that Philip could handle his own life! 
"Sarah doesn't have a plate! She doesn't fit at this table!" Rebecca retorted irritably, nudging Megan, who gritted her teeth. I sneered, relishing the irritation my presence caused them, knowing they couldn't do anything about it.  
Megan looked like she was on the verge of tears, bowing her head.  
As Philip fed me, we watched the program for that party.  
"Is it good?" he asked gently, offering another bite.  
"Hmm" I nodded appreciatively, savoring the delicious food. It's a whole different vibe when you're at a fancy shindig like this! 
"I'll go get dessert from that table," I told Philip. 
Philip withdrew his arm around me as I made my way to the buffet table, my gaze darting uncertainly over the spread of tempting dishes. Each item beckoned with its allure. 
It felt as though the entire assembly of Philip's family had turned their keen attention toward me, their eyes piercing as I stood by the table. 
In the midst of my indecision, an announcement resonated from the stage, drawing my focus momentarily away from the array of food. I filled a dessert cup with Lavender Panna Cotta with a delicate scoop. 
"How about we move on to opening up a present? Let's bring Auntie Marietta up here, and she'll kindly reveal three gift boxes from our guests," said the announcer.  
Auntie Marietta gracefully ascended the stage, her eyes meeting mine with a sharp intensity as she called out the first guest.  
"Let's give a round of applause to Sarah Mitchell, who kindly joined us tonight, even though she wasn't officially on the guest list. Perhaps she's got something special for me, so let's see what thoughtful surprise she's given me to appreciate."  
All eyes are on me as I discreetly savor a delectable bite, a delicate spoon's handle peeking from my lips.  
'Oh, no! A gift?' 
Most guests here were Philip's relatives, and they likely anticipated my embarrassment.
###chapter 37: Unwrapping Thief 
**Sarah**  

The corner of Auntie Marietta's lips lifted, reflecting the disdainful expression worn by my former mother-in-law as the guests cast mocking glances my way. Their evident disgust with my presence was palpable. 
Approaching the main stage stoically, I accepted the microphone from the speaker's outstretched hand. 
"Auntie Marietta, are you certain we should broach this topic?" I softly asked her, not wanting to shoulder any blame if she felt embarrassed at the end. 
Auntie Marietta responded with a tight-lipped smile, barely acknowledging me. It was clear they considered me nothing more than an unwelcome intruder. 
"It's fine, Sarah! What more could I expect from you?" Auntie Marietta retorted, her words laced with condescension. Megan and Rebecca couldn't contain their amusement at her remark. 
"If that's the case, why invite me at all?" I questioned bluntly, unfazed by the challenging glares directed my way. 
Rebecca seized the microphone from my grasp, amplifying her voice as she echoed Auntie Marietta's sentiments for all to hear: "Because you're pathetic! You've come to this party to mooch off the food, have you? Because you have nothing? Tsk! The manners of the broke and desperate, I can tell! She can't even manage a simple gift and crashing parties uninvited!" 
The hall fell into an uncomfortable silence, the tension evident as Rebecca's words lingered in the air. It was as if the guests felt a collective embarrassment on my behalf. 
Fueled by frustration, I seized Rebecca's microphone and slapped her cheek resoundingly. 
The people gasped. 
"You, bitch!!!" Rebecca's piercing scream of anger reverberated through the air. 
Her mother, Auntie Marietta, rushed to her side to offer support. 
"That slap was a reminder for you! It appears Ms. Rebecca may have forgotten what her mother did at Serenity Pines Estate," I stated into the microphone before proceeding. "Now you understand how having someone unexpectedly intrudes into your personal space feels. Am I truly the one lacking manners?" 
Drawing closer to Auntie Marietta, I gently brushed my fingertips against the opulent necklace gracing her neck-the Azure Elegance Ensemble.  
As if pulled by an invisible force, her hand instinctively darted towards it, and her eyes widened in shock and apprehension. 
"Since Auntie Marietta seems to be expecting a gift from me, perhaps I need to remind her," I said with a smile. "The necklace, the earrings, and the ring she's wearing? They're mine! The jewels were gifted to me by Philip Cornell! Oh yes, I don't recall ever giving them to her!" 
Gasps rippled through the guests. 
"Does that mean Marietta stole it from Sarah?" a nearby lady, Auntie Marietta's friend, whispered. 
"I didn't steal this Azure Elegance Ensemble!" Auntie Marietta interjected defensively. 
With a sweet smile, I turned to the lady who had commented. "C'mon, Madame! Auntie Marietta didn't steal the necklace! Perhaps she considers them an advance gift for today's event!"  
The lady was left flabbergasted by my response. 
"Ah, yes! I remember now! The gown Rebecca is wearing-it happens to be mine as well!" I flashed a sweet smile at the guests, calmly presenting the facts. "A renowned couture designer made it. I recall I was slated to wear it to an event by Luminary Productions. Rebecca assured me she would have it dry-cleaned before I could use it. Looks like it's due for another round of dry-cleaning now that she's wearing it to this event!" 
A ripple of giggles echoed through the hall. I maintained my smile, acting like the witty speaker in a comedy skit. 
The mother and daughter duo's eyes widened in disbelief. Their eagerness to shoo me away and stop my revelations was almost comical. 
"Lies! She's lying! What right does that woman have to own such extravagant things?! She's nothing but a squatter! Uneducated!" Auntie Marietta's voice quivered with anger. 
I noticed her confidence waver, especially as her friends shot her puzzled glances. 
With a nonchalant air, I reached for my phone nestled in my pocket, noticing an unread message from Jakob. Staying true to my agenda, I retrieved the receipt for the jewelry Philip had gifted me during our marriage and displayed it for all to see. 
Feigning surprised, I exclaimed, "Oh! Could you imagine? Here's the receipt! It's billed to Sarah Cornell-yeah, that's me! And the item-surprise, surprise-it's the Azure Elegance Ensemble!" 
A murmur of agreement rippled through the room. "Well, in that case, it's highly unlikely Marietta owns the jewelry." 
Someone chimed in, "Indeed, Splendor Jewels doesn't duplicate exclusive designs, as far as I'm aware," affirming the improbability of Marietta's ownership. 
I continued, "Oh, by the way! I also recall some items in Auntie Marietta's possession from Serenity Pines Estate! There are three paintings, the imported jars, and, oh yes, Rebecca's car that she's currently using-they're mine!" 
"She's lying!" Rebecca interjected, her voice sharp. 
"Alright, bring forth anyone who can refute your claims!" Auntie Marietta retorted. 
"I can!" Philip stepped forward, giving me a deep stare. 
Silence engulfed the surroundings like a heavy shroud as I coolly spoke into the microphone, "Kru, kru..." 
Auntie Marietta clenched her teeth, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. 
At that moment, it became undeniable that Philip's financial and status capability was beyond question. 
"I never inquired about trivial matters like that with Sarah," Philip affirmed.  
Yeah, because I knew he didn't care about me. Philip never inquired about such things. 
*** 
**Philip**  

"I never imagined you would steal from Sarah," I confronted Auntie Marietta, unable to resist approaching them. 
Auntie Marietta trembled in fear. "No, Philip! Th-that's not true!" 
If that's the case, how would they explain those things to me? I stared at Sarah; she was emotionless. 
I had noticed some items missing from Serenity Pines before. Initially, I assumed my ex-wife might have sold some of her belongings. I refrained from questioning Sarah about those items, but I couldn't shake the annoyance I felt toward her. I thought she was a gold-digger who valued material possessions at Serenity Pines only for their monetary worth. 
Moreover, I had already bestowed those items upon Sarah as gifts, so I saw no need to worry about their whereabouts.  
Anger coursed through me as I realized my foolishness. 
"Perhaps Sarah was correct. You didn't steal those items; you merely assumed they would be given to you as gifts! However, my perspective differs, Auntie. You robbed Serenity Pines Estate, which is my property!" I declared.  
Auntie Marietta's eyes widened. "N-no, Philip!" 
My mother, Madam Cornell, intervened. "Philip, please refrain from tarnishing Auntie Marietta's reputation. P-perhaps she simply borrowed the jewelry or the painting!" 
"Who else has taken items from Serenity Pines Estate? Speak up now!" I demanded, scanning the crowd with narrowed eyes. "Return those items to Serenity Pines, or prepare to face legal consequences for theft!" 
"Philip!" my mother scolded, her tone tinged with anger. "This is a public event! It's embarrassing for the other guests!" 
It appeared that my mother had overlooked the fact that it was my aunt who ignited the drama. 
"I dare anyone to attempt to unveil what occurred here tonight; they'll be hearing from my lawyer," I asserted. 
I fixed my gaze upon my auntie, her expression betraying a belief that I remained oblivious to her devious scheme aimed at tarnishing Sarah's reputation. They harbored illusions of portraying my ex-wife as lacking in manners, but Sarah's unyielding truth ruthlessly dismantled their deceitful façade. 
Sarah spoke again, "Philip, let's try to stay calm. On another note, since Auntie Marietta is expecting a gift from me, I've already decided which of the items lost at Serenity Pines I'd give her." 
My aunt nearly broke down when confronted with the implicit accusation of theft. 
With a calculated grin, Sarah turned to Auntie Marietta and said, "Perhaps I should ask you directly, Auntie. Which item would you like?" 
In response, my aunt collapsed, feigning illness.  "I feel dizzy! I need a doctor!" 
"Mom!" Rebecca cried, filled with worry and urgency. 
Sarah shrugged, abandoning the microphone, and strolled back to the dessert section as if she hadn't just stirred up trouble. I could only shake my head in disbelief at her audacity.  
The urge to reprimand her disobedience was strong; I even imagined giving her a good smack on her butt, squeezing them by my hands.  
Thoughts of retribution flooded my mind, contemplating what I would do when we returned to Serenity Pines Estate.  
However, my attention was momentarily diverted as I had a call with Alex. That little minx-she slipped away from my grasp!
###chapter 38: Grip of Unseen 
**Sarah** 

I'm not to blame for how the gathering mirrored the darkness of my blouse. Auntie Marietta felt embarrassed in front of her friends, and Philip's family appeared perplexed, their frustration seemingly aimed at me. 
I excused myself from Philip, stating, "I'll be right back; I just need to step away for a comfort room." 
He glanced at me, perhaps assuming I needed the restroom after indulging in so much food. 
"Hmm..." he murmured, nodding in understanding. 
Assistant Alex coincidentally messaged him, diverting my ex-husband's attention to urgent office matters. 
Jane's absence raised questions. Where could she be? Perhaps her flight was delayed, causing her to arrive late to the gathering. 
In the restroom, I checked Jakob's message. 
"Ten minutes, doll!" it read. 
I quickly shot a message to Jane, firm in my decision not to depart the gathering without catching sight of her. As I typed, my attention was drawn to my ex-mother-in-law's deliberate retreat from Auntie Marietta's birthday festivities. Though I told myself I shouldn't be concerned, my determination to unravel her intentions grew stronger as I resolved to keep a cautious eye on her. 
Driven by curiosity, I discreetly followed Madam Cornell as she made her way down the garden path. 
'Was she meeting someone?' My curiosity intensified when I overheard a familiar voice filled with anguish. 
"Madam Cornell! Please, don't do this to Sarah! She's innocent," Jane pleaded urgently. 
'What's going on?'  
What's happening that I'm not supposed to know about? My curiosity took over, drawing me into the conversation.   
Madam Cornell casually lit her cigarette before responding, "If that's the case, would you marry Mr. Olsen?" 
Jane's expression tightened with confusion.  
'Who on earth is Mr. Olsen?' 
"Listen, Jane. I understand you've tried to break free from my influence. But don't mistake independence for freedom. Despite your graduation and my husband's leniency in allowing you your apartment, your connection to me remains. Because of your mother's actions and your status as my husband's illegitimate child, I must use you," Madam Cornell explained coolly. 
"I've done nothing to deserve this!" Jane protested tearfully. "What more do you want? I've promised not to interfere with my dad anymore; just leave Sarah alone!" 
"Then marry Mr. Olsen. That's all I want from you!" Madam Cornell declared firmly, her resolve unwavering. 
As an observer, I found myself confused by the exchange unfolding before me. 
"Come closer," Madam Cornell commanded, her voice cutting through Jane's sobs as my friend complied. She was reluctantly drawn into Philip's mother's orbit. What was she planning now? I knew Madam Cornell was unhinged at best.  
Jane with tears streaming down her face, obeying Philip's mother. What could be her intention? It's no secret that my ex-mother-in-law has a penchant for the bizarre. It's no secret she didn't treat Jane kindly, which ultimately led to Jane's decision to escape Highland Hills and seek refuge as an exchange student in London. 
Before my thoughts could stray elsewhere, Jane's struggle to hold back tears caught my attention, accompanied by the acrid scent of burnt hair permeating the air. There, amidst the shadows, stood Madam Cornell, a lighter flickering in one hand while the other clutched Jane's hair, threatening it with flame. 
"Let me make one thing clear, Jane," Madam Cornell's voice dripped with venom, "It infuriates me how much you resemble your mother!" 
Unable to stand idly by, I advanced toward them with purpose, seizing Madam Cornell by the shoulder. Surprise registered on her face; she hadn't anticipated an audience in this secluded corner of the garden. 
In a swift motion, she raised her hand to strike, venomous words poised on her lips, "Another, slut!" 
But before she could unleash her fury, I intercepted her hand and delivered a resounding slap across her cheek.  
"You've lost your mind!" I exclaimed, my voice raw with anger. 
"Keep your distance from my son!" Madam Cornell retorted, her voice escalating to a scream. 
"Sarah!" Jane's urgent plea halted my advance toward my former mother-in-law. 
Yet, in that moment, fury surged within me, igniting a desire to confront Madam Cornell once more. Witnessing her cruel treatment of my friend fueled my rage. If I was Maleficent's daughter, then she's a wife of a demon! 
Madam Cornell's sharp gaze bore into mine.  
"Philip will hear of this," she declared. 
"Please don't, Sarah! She'll ruin your life! My brother is already angry with you... please..." Jane began as she held onto my arm. 
"Jane, they've long destroyed my life!" What that monster did to me wasn't simple!"  
Madam Cornell hurt my unborn baby! She wasn't satisfied, and she really planned to kill me too! My chest tightened, and I began to struggle to breathe. 'Sarah, you must calm down...' 
"That's exactly the reason! That's why, please, calm down..." Jane said, tears welling up in her eyes. 
I stared at Jane before embracing her tightly. I forced myself to close my eyes and regain my composure. 
"What did she say to you, Jane?! What did Madam Cornell ask of you to marry that Mr. Olsen?" 
"Y-you heard it?" Jane asked. 
"I did! So, tell me what it is?" My voice rose. I knew that Madam Cornell was using me to control Jane. 
That lady is a pathetic psychopath! 
"She told me she has connections with BM Technologies, and she'll make it hard for you even if you're not here in Highland Hills anymore... Sarah, I know you love your job! I'm so guilty that you already had to sacrifice the offer from London. And I know that BM Technologies accepted you because of your capabilities. But s-she's doing everything even though you're already separated from Philip. I don't want you to end up like me. She still managed to control me even when I was in London..." 
As tears streamed down Jane's cheeks, I shot a piercing glance in Madam Cornell's direction. 
"Wow," I muttered, clapping with sarcasm, then turned my attention back to Jane. "Jane, you're fully aware she's manipulating everything, but have you considered she might be using me to manipulate you?" 
My friend halted, tears brimming in her eyes. "What should I do?" 
I know! Madam Cornell understood Jane too well. Whatever she desired, she could effortlessly implant it in Jane's thoughts. 
Madam Cornell smirked. "Indeed, I can manipulate both of you. Especially you," she jabbed a finger in my direction, rising from her seat and starting to leave. 
I called after her. "Serena Blake!" 
Madam Cornell stopped abruptly, her eyes narrowing as she turned towards me. 
A smirk tugged at my lips. Her reaction confirmed it; Serena Blake was indeed Madam Cornell's real name. 
"I'll be waiting for your next move," I stated, my words laced with deeper implications. 
She sneered before departing the sheltered garden. 
Turning to Jane, I noticed half of her hair was singed, the ends stiff from Philip's mother's actions. "Oh, Jane. What did that wicked woman do to you? Why didn't you report her to Philip or even your dad?" 
Despite Jane's status as an illegitimate child, I recognized the significance of her connection to Mr. Cornell.  
"Brother Philip is always busy" She wiped her tears as they continued to fall. "Furthermore, what Madam said is true... I've become a stain on their family. Sarah, my father only acknowledges me as his daughter. While I may appear as a spoiled daughter outside the Cornell Mansion, my father agreed to marry me off to Mr. Olsen because it would benefit him. And he only agreed because of Madam Cornell's suggestion." 
The realization that Philip's mother could manipulate situations hit me hard. That psychotic lady! 
"I've been begging Madam Cornell to end her deal with the Olsen Family because I never agreed to the marriage, but she's using your name, Sarah. She claimed she's tampering with your medication and could do worse to you." 
That conniving woman really infuriated me! I can't blame Jane for not understanding my situation. I can't confide in her the real me because I fear she might be put in danger, too. 
As we embraced, we were interrupted by Philip's father's assistant. 
"Ms. Jane, your father is waiting for you!" 
"Oh! He's back?" Didn't Mr. Cornell leave Auntie Marietta's birthday party? Now, it turns out Philip's dad didn't leave the hotel after all. 
I have a suspicion that Mr. Cornell simply doesn't enjoy family gatherings. Regardless, if I were in his shoes, I'd decline to attend the Cornell Family events! 
"I'm going," Jane announced. 
"I'm headed back to Henderson. Drop me a message. Let's catch up soon!" I embraced her once more. 
Jane nodded. I need to help her, but for now, Amir comes first! 
As Jane and I went our separate ways, I saw Philip engaged in a heated argument with his mother. 
Frantically, I scoured the hotel for an escape route until I finally met Jakob. 
"Argh! I'm utterly drained," I remarked, collapsing into the car seat, exhaustion consuming me. 
"Sarah, it appears we have a tail," Jakob noted. 
"What?"
###chapter 39: Frock Fiasco 
**Sarah**  

"Just kidding!" Jakob's grin widened as he spoke. 
My immediate impulse was to kick him. "You nearly gave me a heart attack with that joke! I'm not in the mood, and I'm sleepy," I grumbled. 
Jakob chuckled, clearly amused by my reaction. "You get laid lately?" Before I could protest, he added, "Don't deny it; I can read you like a book. Your cheeks always give it away when you lie. And those marks on your skin? Pretty incriminating." 
I hastily adjusted the car mirror, scrutinizing my neck and arms for any signs of love marks. Alas, nothing but smooth skin! "You're such a jerk." 
He laughed, seemingly delighted with himself. "Who knew catching you red-handed would be this easy, doll? But seriously, didn't you say you were done with your husband?" 
I let out a tired sigh, gazing out the window. "Philip and I... it's just impossible." 
"Why's that?" 
"Because he hurt me," I explained, a tinge of sadness creeping into my voice. "He treated me disrespectfully as his wife and woman. Philip doesn't love me; he's just content with my company and our sexual chemistry. Plus, it's like trying to bring together oil and water, especially with his manipulative mother stirring the pot!" 
"Did you know Philip locked me up in Serenity Pines on my first day at the villa? Then, I heard the regret in his voice when I had a panic attack. It felt like a twisted game, reminiscent of my experiences with my ex-husband. Perhaps I amused him," I continued. 
"Did he harm you?" Jakob's voice carried concern. 
"No, he confined me in the wardrobe." 
"Tsk! I'm genuinely surprised you stayed after that," Jakob's tone shifted to a mix of annoyance and disbelief. "I could've picked you up if I knew. Why didn't you call me then?" 
"Because it's only now that I've had real conversations with Philip. When we were married, it was more like a Q&A-one question, one answer... But now, there's banter, and strangely, I enjoyed it. That's why I stayed longer. Furthermore, I feared I wouldn't escape him if I left immediately." 
"You two had quite a fetish as a married couple!" Jakob's astonishment was evident. 
"It's more his fetish!" I retorted, feeling a blush creep onto my cheeks. 
"But you seem to enjoy it," Jakob pointed out. 
I shot him a glare. "Let's move on from him, alright? What's the latest on our work?" 
"Things are wrapping up, but we must finalize the budget and launch date with BM Technologies. Oh, and surprise, you'll be heading back to Highland Hills next week!" Jakob announced. 
"What? Why me? Why not you?" I exclaimed, my eyes widening. I had barely escaped that place, and now it seemed fate was dragging me back to that rascal's home! 
"I'm sorry! LoveLogic requires funding, and I negotiated with BM Technologies to lead their security software team. There's some trouble brewing in Team Avenger, and Bronn offered me the position," Jakob explained. 
"It sounds like BM Technologies is taking advantage of you. Should I speak to Bronn and let him know you're not their puppet?" I suggested. 
"I'm making good money, doll! BM Technologies is a big deal for me," Jakob defended. 
At his response, a deep furrow formed between my brows. It meant I was returning to Luminary Productions to handle ChronoGrafix for a project. 
Just as I was on the brink of surrendering to the exhaustion of an impending arduous journey with Jakob, the insistent ring of my phone abruptly jolted my world. There, glaring at me from the screen, was Philip's name! 
"Missed you already? Didn't you say goodbye to your husband?" Jakob teased. 
"I ran away! And why on earth would I bid him farewell? After all, he's no longer my husband!" 
I flung my phone onto the dashboard, unintentionally hitting the answer button. Philip's irate voice suddenly filled the car as it connected to the Bluetooth navigator. 
"Sarah! Where on earth are you?!" 
Jakob couldn't contain his amusement as he drove, barely stifling a laugh. 
"Philip, let's keep it cool, okay? You're tracking me down like I'm some lost pet!" 
He echoed Jakob's sentiment. "Because you neglected to tell me where you were headed!" 
"Oh, come on! I made my great escape, didn't I? Why would I bother giving you a heads-up? You practically didn't want me back to Henderson!" 
Trying to reason with me, he said, "Because it's not safe there! Remember that run-in you had with those thieves?" 
"Quit whining, Philip! Anywhere is dangerous! Serenity Pines is even more dangerous than Henderson!" 
Philip let out a heavy, aggravated sigh, clearly irritated. "Sarah, if you don't return, I'll prove to you just how unsafe Serenity Pines Estate can be!" 
"Sure, sure, I'm shaking in my boots," I quipped, rolling my eyes. Philip's mansion in Highland Hills was probably the most secure place around. I was simply annoyed at his 'tsundere' attitude! 
"I'll bite your clit, and I won't let you cum until you're the one begging for it! And I'll make you beg five times!" Philip declared. 
Philip's outrageous comment left Jakob slamming the brakes, as if trying to escape the sheer audacity of it. My poor clit prayed a vigil for a swift escape from such verbal assaults! 
"Y-you're such an ass!" I exclaimed at Philip, my face burning with embarrassment. "Anyway, I appreciate your hospitality and the meals, but it's time for me to head back to work and attend Amir's wedding!"  
And that uncouth brute! He dared to hang up on me like a sulking child. I was utterly perplexed. Jakob remained bewildered, unable to fathom the sheer audacity of what he had just heard. 
"Geez! Next time, could you spare me the full drama of your marital disputes? My ears are feeling thoroughly abused over here!" he interjected. 
"Ex! He's overly dramatic!" 
"Probably just jealous of Amir, or maybe Bronn being included!" Jake added. 
I rolled my eyes and powered off my phone. "Forget about him! Hmph!" 
Sinking back into the car seat, exhaustion washed over me, prompting me to close my eyes. 
*** 
I returned to apartment number 5, embarking on a day consumed by preparations for Amir's engagement banquet. Jessica's remark about me donning a white, floor-length gown lingered in my mind. The festivities were set to kick off later today, with the wedding following tomorrow. 
Though I knew the notion of me wearing white wasn't accurate, I erred on the side of caution and ordered a long chiffon dress in that shade. With my luggage and a duffel bag inside the vehicle, I went to Amir's opulent mansion. Cars streamed in continuously, signaling the arrival of guests. The entrance exuded grandeur, and notable figures from Amir's social circle had already congregated. 
As I stepped out of the car, I was cloaked in a long, flowing white dress. Yet, rather than admiration, a palpable unease emanated from Amir's assistant, Mr. Reynolds, who appeared stricken with fear at the sight of me. His wide-eyed gaze mirrored the apprehension that seemed to ripple through the guests, casting scrutinizing looks in my direction. 
"Miss Sarah, what are you wearing?" Mr. Reynolds stammered. 
"A dress," I replied nonchalantly. 
"But, Miss..." 
Before he could finish, Amir's voice rang out, calling my name. "Sarah!" 
With a smile, my brother enveloped me in a warm embrace. "I've missed you!" 
"You too, Amir!"  
It appeared that Amir had no remarks regarding my attire, leading me to assume that perhaps Jessica's bridal party was expected to be white.  
"You seem like you've had a rough night," I observed, noting his tense demeanor. He exuded a more mournful presence than a groom on his special day. 
"We had a disagreement last night-Jess and me. I hadn't anticipated the extent of her plans. We clashed over certain details. The wedding planner withdrew yesterday. Jess no longer wishes to collaborate with her!"  
"And I presume that's your girlfriend's doing!" 
Amir winced at my remark. "Jess simply has her heart set on certain things. Anyway, I should go greet the other guests!"  
I knew Amir was merely evading the possibility of me pressing him further about his relationship issues. 
Amir's assistant approached me. "Allow me to accompany you, Miss Sarah." 
"Thank you," I replied, walking alongside the assistant. 
"Miss Sarah, forgive my curiosity, but why are you wearing a long white dress?" Mr. Reynolds inquired 
"Jessica mentioned that her bridal party should be dressed in white. But what has that woman done to Amir this time? The exhaustion in your boss's eyes is evident, and it's clear he hasn't slept," I observed. 
The assistant glanced around cautiously before leaning in to whisper in my ear. 
"Ms. Jessica has suddenly replaced the wedding planner. She's accusing the planner of seducing Boss Amir. Ms. Jessica has barred Boss from communicating with the original planner. On top of that, it seemed Ms. Jessica had already splurged half a million dollars on this party alone! She's even invited some notable figures solely for her social media presence," Mr. Reynolds divulged. 
She's a scam! 
"Anyway, Miss Sarah, I don't think Ms. Jessica's bridal party will wear white," he added with a frown. 
In response, the assistant retrieved his phone and presented me with a dress from Jessica's couture supplier.  
It was black. That conniving bitch! 
"Give me the wedding planner's number," I demanded from Mr. Reynolds. 
His eyes widened in disbelief as he witnessed the audacious act I was about to commit.
###chapter 40: Password Palooza 
**Philip** 

Sarah's escape has left me in a foul mood, and I have reprimanded several employees in the office because of it. I issued a strict deadline to my team, sending them into a frenzy as they scrambled to meet it.  
Josh has lost his utility as a pawn in my game against Sarah; her apparent fearlessness rendered him useless as leverage. 
"Boss, it appears Mr. Amir Benner knew Madam Sarah before your marriage," Alex interjected, drawing my attention. 
I looked up, intrigued, awaiting Alex's explanation. 
"Ms. Jessica Woods and Madam Sarah attended the same university before Madam Sarah relocated to Highland Hills. That's the extent of our findings." 
"So, you're saying they could've been fighting over the same guy, and that guy's Amir?" I grimaced as I asked. 
"No, Boss! Please don't entertain such thoughts. You are far more dignified and handsome than him," Alex reassured hastily. 
Alex seemed determined to alleviate my mood, but his words failed to stir any emotion within me. 
"I don't want to hear any more about Amir Benner or his connection to Sarah," I responded curtly, feeling a wave of darkness wash over me. My growing annoyance towards Amir only serves to strain my relationship with Sarah. 
Their connection runs deep, and I can't help but feel jealous whenever Amir crosses my mind! 
I couldn't immediately follow her to Henderson to pick up my ex-wife. I must complete the task assigned by the chairman to gain permission to attend Amir's engagement. Additionally, Sarah and I are no longer married, and I lack complete control over her decisions and actions. 
She relies on her job at Henderson for financial support. Yet, I can't shake off the frustration of her absence and her persistent stubbornness. 
"We've received a letter from TerraTraxx Automotive. It's official, boss! You'll be their ambassador within a year." 
The reminder of this opportunity sparked my curiosity about Sarah's potential ties to the company, possibly through her connection with Amir. 
Another lingering question arises: Was Sarah truly Blaze Bell, or was this merely a figment of my imagination? 
"What else?" I inquired of Alex. 
"About the laptop Madam Sarah left at Serenity Pines..." he informed. 
Hmm... I recalled that Sarah was eager to bring her laptop to Henderson and return it to BM Technologies. I asked someone to at least fix the technicalities. Maybe she left it behind intentionally, providing herself with a pretext to come back. 
"Bring it here!" I instructed Alex. 
After a brief delay, the laptop encased in a pink sleeve was placed on my desk. As I powered it on, I noticed confusion etched on Alex's face. 
"Are you certain about this, boss?" he queried. 
I'm not really sure what I'm doing. I just wanted to dig deeper into Sarah's world. As soon as I powered the laptop on, it demanded a password. 
"What would Sarah possibly use as her password?" I queried Alex, peering at the screen. 
Alex pondered for a moment. "Maybe your wedding anniversary! You could try Madam Sarah's name followed by your anniversary. The Madam seems straightforward. I doubt she'd choose a complex password." 
Sarah's flushed cheeks or her annoyed expression flashed in my mind's eye. 
I couldn't help but grin at Alex's suggestion. There was a flicker of satisfaction knowing that Sarah might actually be contemplating our anniversary. 
'Error 404: Password not found' flashed on the screen. 
"It's wrong!" I said.   
"How about trying Serenity Pines? Followed by your address number?" Alex suggested. 
After attempting Alex's suggestion, the screen displayed 'Error 404: Password not found' once more. 
"I'll take a crack at it myself." 
I typed in 'Philip' followed by my birthday, fingers crossed for a breakthrough. 
Instead, the screen ominously dimmed, revealing a mocking message: 'Nice try! Is Philip your name? You might be the most stupid hacker ever! How about 'IHaveTheSmallestDickEver ThatSheCannotFeelMyWilly' next time? Just kidding, please don't!' accompanied by a cheeky tongue emoji. Then, the screen abruptly shut off, and the device powered down. 
I'm completely at a loss for words, considering whether that emoji was Sarah sneering at me. 
Afterward, my expression contorted in extreme displeasure. 
"Oh, Boss! Why did you break Madam's laptop? She'll surely discover our attempt to access it. If I had known you intended to hack into it, I would have enlisted an expert," Alex lamented. 
"If you were aware, why didn't you speak up earlier?!" I sighed, rubbing my temples in frustration. 
I'll have to confront whatever consequences arise when Sarah learns of our failed attempt. In this critical moment, I must press on and fulfill my duties to salvage any semblance of justification for my attendance at Amir's wedding. 
"That woman! She's going to see what dick looks like!" I exclaimed, irritated by the situation. "And where on earth did she come up with 'She cannot feel my willy'?" 
I sensed Alex getting a second-hand embarrassment! His mouth was hanging open.  "Boss, s-she didn't feel your willy?" 
My cheeks flushed with anger. "Stop staring at me like that! Don't you want to head home and rest?" 
Alex cleared his throat before speaking cautiously. "No! I mean, perhaps it's..." He paused, eyeing me like I have three heads. "Just how small is it, boss?" 
I shot him a sharp look. "Alex, leave! I'm perfectly adequate!" 
It's as if Alex is entertaining the idea that the size of my package could be the reason Sarah fled to Amir Benner's fortress! 
"Get rid of this!" I commanded, pointing at the laptop. 
But Alex looked at me skeptically, as if he doubted my intentions. 
That saucy little minx! How dare she humiliate me like this?! I must finish my task so that I can teach her a lesson!  
*** 
**Sarah**  
"Miss Sarah, are you certain about this?" Mr. Reynolds inquired as I strode towards the wing designated for Jessica's bridal party. Regrettably, I am among her bridesmaids. 
"Yes," I replied nonchalantly. 
"B-but won't Ms. Jessica be upset?" 
"Let her be! Get that wedding planner on the line! I need to speak with her!" I instructed Amir's assistant.  
Amanda awaited me at the entrance of the adjacent wing, visibly relieved. 
"Miss!" Her expression lit up. 
"I'm delighted Amir sent you today." 
"I've missed you! Your Grandpa Mitchell brought me along to attend to your needs." 
Oh, how desperately I needed Amanda's assistance! Yet, the cruel reality was that I couldn't bring her along to Highland Hills. 
Mr. Reynolds stayed alone at the hallway's entrance, hesitating in the faint light. Meanwhile, Amanda guided me towards Jessica's bridal party. Despite the bustling activity, the muffled laughter of women echoed through the closed door. With a gentle knock, Amanda signaled our arrival before opening the door. 
All eyes turned to me as I entered. Ten women were present, and Jessica and her mother were seated on the expansive couch. 
Jessica let out a scream upon spotting me in a long white dress. "Ahh! I knew it! I knew you had something planned for today!" 
Tss! With a sigh, I rolled my eyes at the scene unfolding before me. This woman seemed utterly clueless, or perhaps her facial features were so altered by injections and Botox that her expressions couldn't convey her drama properly. 
"Wow! Is that Amir's other woman?" inquired her maid of honor, sneering at me. 
I raised an eyebrow. It appeared that Jessica's excessive cosmetic enhancements had not only altered her appearance but also clouded her ability to introduce me to others properly. 
Jessica's mother stormed over, her face contorted with anger. "You show no respect for my daughter!" 
Her hand moved to strike me, but I swiftly intercepted it, avoiding any escalation.  
"Tsk! It's becoming clearer where Jessica inherited her unpleasant attitude," I remarked casually. 
"You're a slut!" Jessica screamed in response. "Why did you choose to return after being away for three years?" 
With a nonchalant stride, I approached her and delivered a hard slap to her artificially plumped cheek and lips, a result of her excessive cosmetic enhancements. 
"Aah!" she cried out. "Somebody gets Amir! Tell him this woman is ruining everything!" 
"Lock her up! Amir must see the truth about this troublemaker ruining Jessica's special day! Who in their right mind wears white besides the bride?" Mrs. Woods demanded; her voice filled with anger. 
The other bridesmaids in the room quickly moved to restrain me, restricting my movements. 
"Miss Sarah!" Amanda interjected, her voice filled with urgency. "Please, let's not resort to drastic measures." 
They shoved me forcefully into another room, an extension of the previous one, which was a tearoom. It was a relief that it offered more space than the cramped wardrobe that Philip had confined me to. 
My attention was drawn to Jessica's words: "Slap that maid!" She was referring to Amanda. 
A surge of anger coursed through me. Jessica's behavior was beyond reason. She was targeting Amanda because of me! 
My frustration intensified until I heard Amir's voice. 
"Amir! Sarah is wearing a long white dress!" exclaimed the stupid woman. Should I remind her that she instructed me to wear white? 
"Where is Sarah?" Amir inquired urgently. 
"Th-There!" 
"Boss, help Miss Sarah inside!" Amanda suggested. 
"Shut up! Amir, we're just trying to prove to you that Sarah's a total brat! She couldn't even bother to follow the bride's rules!" Mrs. Woods exclaimed, her tone dripping with irritation. 
"Amir, Sarah is wearing white, almost like a bridal dress!" Jessica cried.  
"Open the door!" Amir commanded. 
The room I was confined, swung open, and everyone gave me a puzzled look because I was clad out in black from head to toe.
###chapter 41: Shades of Discontent 
**Sarah** 

I wore a reversible design long dress. Since I always wear black, the dress I ordered has a black garment inside. I had a hunch Jessica was brewing up some drama, aiming to cast me as the villainous sister-in-law. Yet, her swiftness in action caught me off guard; I had anticipated a more theatrical display, perhaps in front of a larger audience. 
As the door to the extension room swung open, Jessica, her cronies, and her mother stood dumbfounded at the sight of me in my elegant black dress. 
Amir's distress was palpable as his eyes met mine. The contrast of my current attire against the white he had seen earlier clearly didn't mind him. Amir, being the traditionalist he is, doesn't place much weight on appearances, a trait perhaps explaining Jessica's lack of genuine affection for him. 
"That's impossible! Amir, Sarah was wearing white just moments ago. You remember, don't you?" Jessica's words stumbled out, tinged with jealousy evident in her gaze. Despite my current choice of black dress, its embellished fabric sparkled, resembling a constellation of stars, outshining Jessica's wedding gown. 
Turning to Amir, I couldn't contain my incredulity.  
"Unbelievable! Amir, your fiancée has been tormenting me! They locked me inside this room, and now I'm the one being painted as the villain? Besides, is it my fault if I'm more beautiful than her?" I accused, the silence around us amplifying the weight of my words. 
The people around were speechless, but my mic drop moment left them with nothing to say. 
I knew it wasn't cool to keep putting Amir in the middle like he's some kind of referee breaking up our spats, but I wasn't about to let another toxic situation slide in our family. 
"Ah, it was you who slapped me! I knew it! Including you in my bridal party was a mistake! And you were wearing a long white dress earlier," Jessica exclaimed. 
"That's right!" her maid of honor chimed in. 
Amir felt exhausted trying to make sense of it all. 
I clapped sarcastically and said, "It's amusing how you're all ganging up on me. Did you know you're mocking each other in private chat?" 
The women couldn't look at each other, and they couldn't respond. I knew it! I wasn't sure about my last statement, but I knew how awful Jessica could be! 
"Amir, do you recognize any of these women in all your years with Jessica? Do you know them besides Mrs. Woods?" 
He remained silent, his lips sealed as if guarding against an impending storm. It was clear he had no intention of fueling the fire further. 
"No! That's why you're pushing me to be part of her bridal party. They were all social media personalities! They weren't even her real friends! And I wouldn't be surprised if the groomsmen were set up similarly." 
Grandpa Mitchell entered the room, causing Jessica to step back. 
"What's happening here?" Grandpa asked. 
"Grandpa!" I acted, pretending to cry. I approached him. "These women bullied me. They locked me in that room," I complained to him. 
Grandpa Mitchell's expression twisted in displeasure. "Amir, what is the meaning of this?"  
Jessica, trembling with apprehension, quickly interrupted, "No, Grandpa! It was Sarah who slapped me!" 
"If Sarah harmed you, there must have been a reason! Are you suggesting my granddaughter acts without cause as if she's lost her mind?" Grandpa retorted sharply, causing Jessica to clench her jaw in frustration. 
"That woman is utterly unhinged! That's why tragedy befell her child; it didn't want Sarah as its mother when it entered this world! Her own baby rejects her, ashamed that its mother was abandoned by its father! She's deranged!" Jessica spat out angrily. 
A shocked gasp rippled through the room as Jessica's words hung heavily. The other women exchanged concerned glances, their whispers casting wary glances in my direction. 
Grandpa Mitchell's anger was palpable. His features contorted with fury, and I felt tension coiling in my muscles, pained by the venomous words exchanged. 
"Jess, apologize to Sarah now!" Amir's voice broke the tense silence. 
"Why should I apologize? Especially to her!" Jessica shot back defiantly. "Have some backbone! Are you going to stand by and let them disrespect me like this? I want nothing to do with your family, not with that old hog or with Sarah-they're both meddlers, utterly worthless!" 
"Jessica!" Amir's sharp rebuke cut through the tension. 
"And you have the nerve to humiliate my family in this manner?" Grandpa Mitchell sneered. "Sancho!" he called out to his assistant. 
"Boss?"  
"Announce to everyone that we are severing ties with the Woods Family! Remove Mr. Woods from his managerial position and divest our stocks in their company!" Grandpa Mitchell's chest heaved with the weight of his decision. 
"Grandpa Mitchell, I'm sorry!" Mrs. Woods knelt. She was evidently the only one who truly understood the gravity of Grandpa's command. "P-please forgive my daughter," she pleaded. 
"Amanda, give this woman a good slap," I commanded, finally exacting retribution for Jessica's disrespect toward my deceased child. Despite the threat of tears, I steadied myself with resolve. 
Jessica's eyes widened in disbelief. It seemed inconceivable to her that a mere maid would dare to slap her, a humiliation that reverberated through those presents. 
"A-Amir!" Jessica appealed to my brother for aid. 
Grandpa warned Amir sternly. "If you truly desire this woman in our family, she must face the consequences of her actions! You've heard how she humiliated me and Sarah!" 
Amanda delivered not one but two resounding slaps to Jessica's cheeks on my behalf before breaking down in tears and collapsing to the ground. Her mother rushed to her side while Amir stood bewildered, grappling with many emotions. I could see he was exhausted from the ongoing drama. 
Grandpa Mitchell called his assistant once more. "Sancho!" 
"Yes, sir?" 
"Ensure that Jessica Woods is never again welcomed within my mansion!" Grandpa declared, his disgust evident toward Amir's fiancée. 
"Understood, sir." 
Grandpa Mitchell departed, his demeanor tinged with frustration. 
"Brother, did you know what your girlfriend introduced me to her friends as? Your mistress, your other woman!"  
The women appeared visibly shocked, especially when I referred to Amir as my brother. 
"The idea of me having a happy relationship with your fiancée is more far-fetched than a crow turning white! I'm truly disappointed." I gritted my teeth as I stormed out of the room, making my way to the main building of the mansion, specifically to the bar area.  
I needed a drink! 
"Could I have a Margarita, please?" I asked the bartender. The drink was swiftly handed to me, and I downed it in one gulp. 
Sitting there, I pondered whether I bore responsibility for my child's death. I also couldn't help but wonder if I had provoked Amir's girlfriend in some way for her to make such an accusation. Or perhaps... 
"Miss Sarah!" Mr. Reynolds' soft call drew my attention. He stood off to the side, near the tall indoor plants, clearly attempting to remain inconspicuous.  
It seemed he preferred to keep our interactions discreet, especially considering the circumstances surrounding the event. Mr. Reynolds was intelligent and able to anticipate trouble when I tasked him with contacting the previous wedding planner. 
Approaching Amir's assistant, he seemed eager to whisper something to me. Leaning in closer, I listened intently to what he had to say. 
"Ms. Sarah, just as you instructed, the wedding planner informed me that she caught Ms. Jessica cheating with one of the groomsmen. The previous planner overheard the one groomsman boasting about meeting Ms. Jessica tonight behind the boss's back. When confronted, Ms. Jessica decided to sever our ties with the planner," Mr. Reynolds whispered. 
Before my temper could fully flare, an arm wrapped around me, pulling me away from Mr. Reynolds. When I lifted my head, I was met with a punishing kiss. 
My mind went blank, and I couldn't move right away. Mr. Reynolds's cheeks flushed, clearly taken aback by what the troublemaker Philip had done.  
Philip's eyes narrowed as he turned to Mr. Reynolds. "She's a young, innocent woman! What are you trying to do? She's almost like your daughter!" 
Mr. Reynolds was stunned, and I was barely coming back to my senses, still reeling from that punishing, mind-boggling, cum-inducing kiss. Did Philip think there was something between me and Amir's assistant?  
"Uhm, M-Mr. Cornell, it's not what it looks like," Mr. Reynolds stammered. "I'm not a groomer." 
"Philip, you're so annoying! You're the one acting like a groomer! I am his daughter!" I interjected. 
Mr. Reynolds was speechless, unable to bring himself to speak.  
"What?" On the other hand, Philip seemed confused, knowing I was an orphan. 
"I mean, he treated me like a daughter! What's your problem? But most of all, I want my knuckles on your face! Could you please stop stealing kisses? What are you even doing here?" I retorted. 
Mr. Reynolds was aware of my relationship with the rascal Philip!  
Before Philip could respond, I was startled as Mr. Reynolds' eyes widened. He turned away and pointed his fingers towards the two men approaching the bar station.
###chapter 42: Unveiled Infidelity 
**Sarah**  
Mr. Reynolds' attempt to evade the attention of the two unfamiliar men who had entered the bar area caught me off guard.  
"Ms. Sarah, that new guy, he's the one the wedding planner said is Ms. Jessica's affair partner! The one with the brooding vibe," Mr. Reynolds whispered urgently.  
Glancing at Philip, I lowered my voice. "Aren't they models from your company?"  
Philip seemed unfazed. "I only deal with my father, the shareholders, or Alex at the company. But that's beside the point! Why does it concern you if they're cheating-"  
I quickly muffled Philip's words before someone could reach prying ears in the bar area.  
"You're being annoying!" I scolded him.  
Mr. Reynolds' phone interrupted us as it rang, then he discreetly excused himself.  
"Ms. Sarah, the boss needs me urgently. The event starts in an hour. Everyone should be at the hall," he informed before leaving me alone with Philip.  
"What's your connection with Amir Benner?" Philip's tone held a trace of irritation despite his apparent indifference. He knew Mr. Reynolds was Amir's assistant.  
"If you're already concluding about me being Mr. Benner's lover, why bother asking? I don't owe you an explanation because we have no relationship-none!" I shot back, equally annoyed.  
Philip's eyes narrowed before he chuckled, "I owned your body, babe. That's our relationship."   
I was left utterly speechless.   
"Yeah, sure!" I sarcastically retorted. "Next time, just bring a recorder so you can play that line whenever necessary. Tss!"  
This brute was beyond ridiculous!   
My attention shifted to the man Jessica was cheating with. He fished his phone out of his pocket and began texting, sneering.  
"I'm going out for a while! The hook-up's happening early!" he declared to his companion.  
"Sure thing. Just make it quick," his companion replied casually.  
Before Philip could react, I swiftly plucked his Bluetooth earpiece from one ear, catching him off guard. With calculated precision, I feigned a clumsy collision with the man, and then, in a swift and covert motion, I covertly deposited Philip's earplug into the man's pocket.  
"Oops! I-I'm sorry!" I apologized to the man.  
The man's gaze swept over me, a twisted grin spreading across his face like a creep!  
"Are you Sarah Mitchell?" Did he know me? And was this lunatic seriously planning to hit on me?  
"Fuck off!" Philip cursed.  
"Mr. Cornell! I... I apologize," the man stammered, his voice trembling as he edged away from Philip, quickly retreating from the bar area of Amir's mansion.  
"Why on Earth did you slip my Bluetooth earpiece into his pants?" Philip demanded.  
Damn it! It hit me like a ton of bricks that Philip was the device's owner! In that instant, my instincts took over, and I noticed a piece of the earpiece nestled in his ear.  
"Give me your phone," I instructed him instead.  
"Why?" Philip challenged, suspicion etched on his face.  
"Because I need to track him," I replied, urgency coloring my voice.  
He looked at me like I had a man's cum on my face. His arms folded across his chest in suspicion.  
"What?" I pressed.   
"I'll lend it to you under one condition," Philip countered.  
"And what's that?" I inquired, curious yet cautious.  
"You're coming back with me to Highland Hills. You haven't even fulfilled the agreement we made for a month."  
In truth, I had several compelling reasons to return to Highland Hills. I needed Josh's expertise, and BM Technologies appointed me as a representative in Philip's project to navigate Chronographix. Lastly, I harbored a burning desire to meet Jane.  
"Deal!"  
I won't be staying at Serenity Pines again. It's too risky when we're together, especially after what happened the other day. Despite this concern, I kept it to myself. Philip only mentioned Highland Hills, not specifying his villa.  
Amir owned the villa across from Serenity Pines Estate, and that's where I'd stay once I'm in Highland Hills.  
Philip delved into his pocket, retrieved his phone, and presented it to me as if unveiling a treasure.  
With determined strides, I stormed out of the mansion, with Philip following closely behind. As we walked toward the car, the city was already bathed in the soft embrace of dusk, casting a gentle glow on the surroundings. The fading light only enhanced the grandeur of the mansion.  
As I settled into the car, I seized the laptop with purpose. My fingers danced across the keyboard as I entered the password: "IHaveTheSmallestDickEver ThatSheCannotFeelMyWilly." The words were visible as I typed, and Philip couldn't help but catch sight of them.  
"Is that really your password?" he asked, sounding offended.  
"Yeah," I replied casually.  
"And where did you come up with that? I'm perfectly adequate!"  
I rolled my eyes at him. "Stop being petty! Jakob suggested it, claiming the phrase was so offensive no one would ever guess it. And what do you mean by 'Is that really your password?' Were you trying to access my laptop back at Serenity Pines Estate?"  
"I asked Alex to fix the laptop's electrical issues. It prompted for a password, and after three failed attempts, it shut off," he explained.  
"You're stupid!"    
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd find myself scolding Philip like this. In a different scenario, he might have lashed out at me.   
The LoveLogic process is ongoing, with codes saved on my laptop. But Philip doesn't need to know about it! I'll just ask Jakob to check the device thoroughly.  
Using Philip's phone, we tracked down his earplug. I pulled up the precise map of Amir's mansion on the laptop and glanced around.  
"That must be the way! They were rendezvousing in the woods?!" I couldn't fathom their audacity to plan infidelity inside Amir's property.  
"Nobody ever goes to that part of the mansion, especially since it's already dusk, so it's the obvious choice for a short affair. But how can you be certain the bride was with the man earlier?" Philip inquired.  
"I have a method to find out."  
I shut the laptop screen, meeting Philip's puzzled gaze.  
"What?" I asked him.  
"What's your motive in all this? Why the apparent desire to drive a wedge between Mr. Benner and his fiancée?" His suspicion resurfaced.  
"Okay, Philip, for your peace of mind, there's absolutely no romantic connection between Amir and me. That's a thousand percent impossible! Tsk!"  
"What?"  
"Furthermore, Megan is a bitch. She's been giving me a hard time and bullying me, and there's no way I'm letting her tie the knot with Amir Benner. That's the bottom line!"  
"She's brazen!" His tone escalated.  
"Right? So, could you please hold off on adding to my plans for now? You're just adding to my headache," I told him, exasperated.   
I retrieved the bag containing the drone from the car's compartment box. I could see the questions forming on Philip's face, but he wisely kept them to himself.   
Messages flooded Philip's cell phone, including those from Megan and various office colleagues. At this point, I couldn't care less about what that woman needed from him.   
"Here, hold your phone," I said, passing it to Philip. That witch Megan might be waiting or looking for him.   
I needed to expedite my plans, and I had no desire to deal with Philip or that troublesome woman at the moment.   
We returned to the gathering, where the main hall was already filled with guests. Balancing my laptop and another bag, I scanned the crowd for Amir.   
"Where's the bride?" I heard the new wedding planner inquire, and frustration was evident in her tone. Even the maid of honor couldn't provide an answer.   
"The event is about to start. Can you please locate her?" the planner snapped, her impatience growing apparent.   
I knew it! Jessica must have slipped away for a sweet, brief rendezvous with that groomsman!  
Philip and I headed to a small, empty room. I needed Jakob's assistance urgently; I couldn't manage everything with two hands.   
Glancing at Philip, this brute's hand could undoubtedly be of use.  
"Why?" Philip queried, his expression a portrait of confusion.  
I didn't answer him.   
I unzipped the bag and carefully extracted the Typhoon H Drone. With practiced hands, I set it up and connected it to my laptop.   
I turned to Philip, asking, "Are you familiar with drones?"  
"Babe, I'm not a moron. Tss!" he replied nonchalantly.  
"Alright then, take control of this one and follow your Bluetooth earplug into the woods," I instructed.  
Instead of complying, he seized the moment to kiss me fervently. My thoughts scattered before he abruptly pulled away, igniting the hexacopter and flying it out the window.  
"What the hell is that for?!" I demanded, my anger flaring.  
I'm occupied with your directives, Ma'am!" the rascal retorted bluntly, a smirk playing on his lips.   
Despite my urge to smack him, I begrudgingly acknowledged his point. Gritting my teeth, I left the room and went to the main hall to set up the laptop for everyone's viewing.  
But upon entering, my plans were derailed. On the large screen, there was a live video of Jessica having sex with a groomsman against a tall tree. They were both partially undressed, their indiscretions broadcast for all to witness.   
Their eyes widened in sheer horror as they locked onto the camera's lens. Then, with a frantic burst of desperation, they fled together like guilty phantoms, escaping the scene of their sins.  
"Oh my God! That's Jessica, the bride!"  
"And that man is one of the groomsmen!"  
Gasps filled the hall as the identities of the two figures became unmistakable. While everyone else was reeling from the revelation of Jessica's betrayal, my mind was consumed by a different puzzle.  
How in the world did it appear on the massive projector screen? I still had my laptop in hand and had yet to link it to any equipment at the event!
###chapter 43: Unveiled Infidelity 2 
**Sarah** 

Jessica and her groomsman lover were hurrying back to the mansion. The people in the hall gasped, their attention turning towards Jessica as they whispered amongst themselves. 
"Gosh! This story is exciting!" I heard from one reporter. 
Could she be any more foolish? She invited nearly every TV station in the city to this event, which she dubs the 'wedding of the year' gathering! It's all about her craving social media fame and flaunting Amir's supposed grand gestures. She's acting like she's Kim K or something! 
Jessica spotted me near the entrance of the event hall. Her attention then shifted to her own image illuminated on the large projector, and she gasped, recoiling in terror. A swift scan of her surroundings heightened her fear as she noticed the drone ominously trailing behind her. I furrowed my brow in confusion, puzzled by the unfamiliar drone; mine is a hexacopter. 
Apart from me, there are others eager to expose Jessica's antics! But who could they be? 
Suddenly, Jessica pointed an accusing finger at me. "It's you! I knew it!" she spat angrily. 
Hold on a second! I haven't even had a chance to react yet! How dare she jump to conclusions just because I happen to have a laptop in my arms! 
"Get that woman out!" my grandfather demanded, stepping forward from the front of the hall, just meters away from me. 
"No! I need to speak to Amir! This is different from what it seems! He'll understand me!"  
"Damn it!" The man by her side, who had just returned, widened his eyes in alarm. As a model, cameras were constantly aimed at him, especially now, with his attire disheveled. All eyes at the gathering turned towards them. 
In an attempt to escape the embarrassment, the groomsman hastily fled the scene. 
Jessica's father strode towards her, his face contorted with a fierce scowl that spoke volumes of his disappointment and anger. 
"You've brought shame upon our family!" His words were followed by a resounding slap across Jessica's cheek. 
"No! It's not... it's Sarah's fault!" She shot me a venomous glare, her teeth clenched. 
I couldn't believe what I was hearing! How could she possibly blame me? Was she out of her mind? 
But Jessica persisted. "It's your fault for irritating me earlier! You put me in a bad mood, which led to this! If you hadn't insisted on attending this event, none of this would have happened! You're the worst kind of person! You should have stayed hidden in Highland Hills forever!" 
This woman! She was even trying to gaslight me! 
"I'm not the one in that video. It's someone else!" Jessica rambled on, seemingly losing her grip on reality. Then, she turned to me accusingly. "Tell them it's not me in the video! You're just a shameless liar!" 
In her rage, she stormed towards me, snatching two glasses from a passing server's tray and flinging their contents in my direction. However, before the wine could splash onto me, a protective arm swooped in, causing the liquid to drench instead the back of the three-piece suit worn by my rescuer. 
As I raised my gaze, Bronn came into view, his eyes narrowing as they settled on the distraught figure of Jessica. 
"M-Mr. Martin!" Jessica's voice quivered in fear as she recognized the head officer of BM Technologies. 
Bronn's two bodyguards swiftly seized Jessica by the arms. 
"You're a bitch!" Jessica's screams filled the room, her words directed at me. "I'm the bride! Let me go!" she continued, oblivious to the spectacle she was creating. Her actions served as a brazen display of disgrace, tarnishing not only her own reputation but also damaging the honor of her family and staining the dignity of Amir in the eyes of all who bore witness. 
A cold voice cut through the tension before I could even contemplate reprimanding her. 
"Get that woman out!" Amir's voice thundered with anger, his eyes betraying his strain. 
"A-Amir!" Jessica stammered, attempting to deflect blame. "I-it's not me. Trust me!" Tears streamed down her face as she pleaded, "It's not me! I love you so much! Please don't do this!" 
I felt an overwhelming urge to slap her. The audacity of this woman to weave such deceitful lies ignited a fiery rage within me! 
"Everyone, you've witnessed Ms. Jessica Woods's betrayal! Seriously? At our engagement celebration? Is that how you think I'm that dumb? I am severing all connections with her and her family! Get her out of my place or involve the authorities if she persists! Every guest is welcome to stay and continue enjoying the party!" Amir's declaration resounded through the hall. 
With that, the guards swiftly escorted Jessica out of the hall, wasting no time carrying out Amir's command. 
I know Amir like the back of my hand! His love for his fiancée runs deep. Yet, it's crystal clear now that he's severed ties with that arrogant woman. With a heart heavy with emotion, Amir ascended the stairs to the second floor. 
"Are you alright?" Bronn inquired. 
"I'm fine! Damn! Are you soaked? Thanks for covering me. Let's get you changed," I offered. 
"No worries. I've got a spare shirt in the car." 
"I'm truly sorry..." 
Luckily, Bronn lived just a mile from Amir's mansion. With Amir on my mind, I made my excuses to Bronn. 
"Thanks, Bronn! I-I need to be with my brother!" 
Amir requires my support; he stood by me during my darkest days last year. 
"I'll come by tomorrow; it seems the wedding might be off," Bronn proposed. 
"I'm not sure that's wise. I'll keep you updated on the mansion's happenings."  Comfortable in Bronn's presence, I welcomed the idea of spending time with him.  
Only then did I notice the hexacopter hovering above us, its menacing hum echoing Philip's relentless surveillance. I'm unsure why, but I feel like I'm channeling Jessica, having clandestine conversations with a secret lover. The thought of Philip's scrutinizing gaze tightens my throat. 
Ah, forget about that brute! 
 "I'll just go after Amir," I bid farewell to Bronn.  
He smiled as he exited the hall, probably to change his attire. Meanwhile, I headed to the mansion's second floor to look for Amir. In the hallway, I saw some of Amir's bodyguards on watch, evidently ready to protect my brother against any threats from the witch or her family who might want to confront him. 
Outside Amir's room, I spotted Mr. Reynolds.  
"M-Ms. Sarah!" the assistant called out, visibly uneasy. 
"Where is my brother?" I inquired. 
"H-he's inside," Mr. Reynolds stammered. 
"What happened tonight? Is Amir serious about breaking up with Jessica?" I questioned, still struggling to believe Amir would make such a decision after abandoning me for her for three years. Perhaps witnessing her betrayal had at last unveiled the truth to him. 
"Yes, he's decided! I've already released a memo to the entire TerraTraxx Automotive about Benner cutting ties with the Woods," Mr. Reynolds explained. 
"About the cheating incident, do you happen to know who the owner of that drone was, who captured Jessica in the woods?" 
It felt as though the very air had been sucked from the room, leaving me breathless as Mr. Reynolds drew in a deep, foreboding breath before delivering his response. 
"It's Boss Amir. He's the owner of that drone, and he himself exposed the cheating incident using the projector for the guests," Mr. Reynolds replied. 
My eyes widened in disbelief! I stood there, utterly stupefied! 
Amir knew! Amir is aware he's being cheated!
###chapter 44: Marriage of Necessity 
**Philip**  
Sarah's relationship with Amir left me perplexed. Despite her insistence that it was not romantic, I couldn't shake the nagging question of how she became pregnant when she asked for a breakup. The thought of me being the father of her child sent shivers down my spine. And why, if I were the father, would she seek a divorce? Was there an abortion involved? What secrets was Sarah concealing?  
'Philip, your lack of care for her may be the root cause,' my conscience echoed, offering a possible explanation.  
Feeling unsettled, I resolved to delve deeper into the matter. The puzzle pieces didn't align- those I had gathered, the scenes I had witnessed, and the information I got from Ethan.  
My mother's interference in Sarah's affairs added another layer of complexity. Perhaps that held the key to unraveling the truth.  
Surveying the scene with the drone, I caught sight of Sarah engaged in conversation with Bronn Martin. A surge of frustration gripped me, witnessing Bronn's protective demeanor towards her.   
This woman! Her interactions with other men grated on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard. But what got under my skin was how she smiled at Bronn, as if they shared some secret bond forged over years of meetings. With irritation gnawing at me, I stormed outside to retrieve the drone.   
The drama was over; time to give the little rebel a spank on her perfect ass! And of course, just my luck, I run into Bronn on his way to his ride.  
"Mr. Cornell! What a pleasant surprise to see you here," he greeted, shaking my hand. His eyes flickered with amusement upon noticing the hexacopter in my arms. "You seem to be keeping an eye on Sarah."  
"Indeed, I'm looking forward to having her back in my life," I remarked casually, subtly hinting at my intentions to Bronn.  
"Interestingly, we seem to share the same goal," Bronn responded.  
"She happens to be my ex-wife," I stated, emphasizing the depth of my connection with Sarah.  
"Sarah is your ex-wife?" He furrowed his brow in surprise. "Ah, that clarifies things. If you're divorced, it suggests she wasn't content in your relationship. I apologize, Mr. Cornell, but that hasn't deterred me from pursuing her."  
I maintained composure, concealing any bitterness I might have felt towards Bronn's words. Though he bruised my pride, I remained stoic in his presence.  
"May the best man win," I declared with a confident grin.  
"And that man is me," he asserted.  
Bronn's words landed like a double blow, crashing in from all angles.  Now, the imperative to reclaim Sarah's heart resonates with a newfound urgency within me. Bronn has ascended as a formidable adversary in the battle for Sarah's affections, stoking the flames of rivalry to a fever pitch within my soul.  
***  
**Sarah**  
"What? Amir was the owner of the drone earlier?"   
Shock registered on my face. I couldn't fathom Amir embarrassing his fiancée like that, especially on the eve of their wedding. Mr. Reynolds ushered me away from Amir's room, gently filling me in on the situation.  
"When you instructed me to contact the previous wedding planner, and I uncovered information about her infidelity, it became my duty to inform Boss Amir as the assistant. He's been under immense stress lately due to the wedding. He hasn't slept since yesterday because of the barrage of negative information he's received about Ms. Jessica. I believe he simply pieced it all together."  
"Perhaps you weren't aware, but Boss Amir learned yesterday from a friend that Ms. Jessica also had an affair with said friend. The friend reached out to the boss yesterday. While conversing in the bar area earlier, Boss Amir called me. It was then that Ms. Jessica and the groomsman mysteriously vanished. Surveillance captured their departure."  
My heart ached for Amir. I could see how deeply he cared for Jessica.   
"Can I speak with him?" I inquired.  
"You can try," Mr. Reynolds replied.  
Returning to Amir's room, I knocked softly. "Amir, it's me... Can we talk?"  
"You may," came his weary response. With a heavy heart, I turned the doorknob and entered.  
I found Amir reclining halfway on the bed, his feet dangling above the floor, his gaze fixed on the ceiling. A palpable sense of negativity lingered in the room.  
"Amir, I'm deeply sorry... I realize now that my reaction only added to your burden. As your sister, I shouldn't have felt relieved about your breakup with Jessica, let alone voiced it. But I've been honest about my doubts regarding her, and I truly believe a healthy relationship between Jessica and me is simply unattainable."  
I also owed Amir an apology for my eagerness to reveal Jessica's true nature earlier. Had he not beaten me to it, he might be even angrier with me now.  
Instead of a direct response, Amir glanced my way. "Sarah, I let you down because of her. You've been warning me for ages about Jessica's infidelity and lack of genuine affection. And now, I've painfully come to realize she's more invested in the idea of the wedding than truly loving me. We've been at odds for days over trivial details; she wants things that aren't important for the wedding.  
"My friends weren't here. As you pointed out, everyone at the wedding seemed to favor her family. She splurged excessively, whereas all I ever wanted was the prospect of marrying her because I genuinely love her.  
"I was prepared to devote myself to her completely, but I couldn't discern her genuine feelings for me... I was blind! And I'm ashamed that I neglected you because of her... When I first laid eyes on Jessica, I was genuinely smitten, and I foolishly pledged her everything."  
"I've been consumed with business, traveling excessively, engaging with various people. I've neglected her in the process. I never thought that would end up working in her favor. People are mocking me for being dumb. Heck, maybe even you would crack up at what I did for her."  
I gripped Amir's hand reassuringly. "Certainly not, brother."  
"But I abandoned you for three years, Sarah! I was oblivious to your needs. I accused you of driving a wedge between Jessica and me. I failed to support you when you faced issues with Dad."  
My chest constricted at the mention of his father.  
"It's alright! I found solace with Philip Cornell back then. And now, I have you and Grandpa again," I replied.  
"Do you still care for Philip Cornell?" he inquired.  
"Do you still love Jessica?" I countered.  
"You're impossible! I detest that man for you!" he retorted with frustration.  
"You needn't fret about that. Philip and I are incompatible. Just as Jessica is to you, Philip doesn't harbor genuine affection for me. He's enamored with the idea of having me in his villa."  
After a few conversations with Amir, I bid farewell to his room to allow him some rest. I sensed the sadness within him, though tears did not fall. It seemed as though Amir struggled to embrace positivity but was steadfast in keeping his composure. The burden of tonight's issue weighed heavily on him.  
I ventured into the adjacent building in search of Philip, recalling that I had abandoned that scoundrel in a small chamber.  
Suddenly, I felt a force yank me into a dimly lit room, and fear surged through me like a torrent!
###chapter 45: Ties That Strain
**Sarah**  

Fear dissolved into oblivion the moment his lips met mine, drowned in the familiar scent of Philip that enveloped me. As he reluctantly withdrew, his gaze lingered on my lips, his thumb delicately tracing their contours.   
Then, I shivered as his hand found its place on my buttocks, tenderly caressing, igniting a sensation that defied description.   
"Philip," I exclaimed, my eyebrow twitching with frustration. "That's my ass!"  
"I know," he replied, unmoving.  
"Move!"  
Instead of conceding, Philip leaned his head on my shoulder, his arms enveloping me. Confusion and shock swirled within me as he unexpectedly became clingy, his hold tightening, his sadness palpable.  
"I just wanted to be close to you," he murmured. "Reflecting on our time together, I can see the mistakes I've made, each one a painful reminder of my shortcomings. I know I'm far from perfect; perhaps that's why we find ourselves in this predicament. Just saying 'sorry' doesn't seem enough to make things right."  
What was going on with him? Despite his evident sorrow, I resisted delving into Philip's emotions, though they softly tugged at my heart.  
Refusing to accept his apology was a choice I made, considering his family's complicated actions toward me.  
I cannot accept it because I foresee ongoing conflict with Madam Cornell and me. We will continue tearing each other's faces because I've had enough of that woman. While she's his mother, I can't undermine the bond Philip shares with his family.  
"It's good that you understand an apology alone won't mend things. I need to stand up for myself, Philip. I've suffered greatly, and what you've done is beyond forgiveness. What your mother did is equally unacceptable," I expressed firmly.  
Philip held me tighter. I knew I couldn't demand that he choose between me and his mother, especially since we're already divorced. It's simpler to believe we're not right for each other than to complicate matters further.  
"What should I do, Sarah?" he pleaded.  
"None..." I refuse to let love blind me once more. I won't allow hope to lead me into another cycle of pain. "I've convinced myself that our relationship is beyond impossible because of the hurt you've caused me. I'll always carry the sadness you've caused me," I stated flatly.  
It's necessary! I can't afford to let another panic attack overwhelm me.  
While I'm being dramatic, I still felt the brute's naughty big hands, groping my ass.  
"Seriously! Are you even listening? All you did was grope me!" I protested, feeling a surge of annoyance.  
But then his lips found my neck, sending shivers down my spine. His kisses and warm breath teased me ceaselessly. You know that sensation of being spellbound, like a shrimp caught in a current? That's exactly how I felt at that moment. Then, Philip placed me at the cabinet top, his presence dominating the space between my legs as he claimed my lips in yet another exhilarating kiss.  
The door swung open, prompting me to nudge Philip forward. A head peeked inside the room; it was Mr. Reynolds. His surprise was evident as he spotted us in Philip's room.  
Feeling like a guilty cat caught in the act, I blurted out, "Nothing happened!"  
Mr. Reynolds glanced at Philip, who was hurriedly smoothing out his rumpled suit.  
"You saw nothing!" I reiterated to Amir's assistant, my tone carrying a hint of warning.  
"Sorry, Ms. Sarah. Th-this is urgent. Can I talk to you?" Mr. Reynolds asked, his demeanor slightly flustered.  
Philip's eyes narrowed, clearly suspicious of Mr. Reynolds' intentions. Did he still believe the assistant was manipulating me? I stepped down from the cabinet, approaching Mr. Reynolds.  
Remaining alert, Mr. Reynolds cast wary glances at Philip as I positioned myself in front of him by the door. Philip's phone rang, adding to the distraction caused by my former husband. He answered it, indicating it was Megan calling.  
I couldn't help but frown.  
"What is it?" I redirected my attention to Mr. Reynolds.  
"Mr. Benner has arrived. He's in the west wing with his mistress, meeting with Grandpa Mitchell," Mr. Reynolds informed me, referring to my dad.  
Considering most of the Benner transactions were present for Amir's wedding, it wouldn't be surprising if Dad had suddenly shown up.  
I need to go, especially now that Philip is here. I can already anticipate the barrage of questions he'll shower me with once he finds out about my relationship with the Benners.  
"Thank you," I expressed to Mr. Reynolds, sensing there was more he wanted to convey but couldn't.  
"Take care, Ms. Sarah," he replied before departing the room. Glancing at Philip, who had just finished a call with Megan, I made my decision.  
"I'm leaving. I've got nothing else to do here," I announced before exiting the room. Checking discreetly that I had all my belongings-hexacopter, laptop, and whatever else-I stowed them in my bag.  
Before getting into the car, I cast one final glance at Amir's mansion before turning my attention to the neighboring building. Dad and I locked eyes; amidst his conversation with Grandpa Mitchell, a silent understanding passed between us. Despite his stoic façade, I could feel his penetrating gaze dissecting my every action.  
Grandpa Mitchell's simmering anger was seemingly directed at Dad as he also acknowledged my presence.   
This family drama-incessantly trailing the Benners, especially involving me!   
As my eyes narrowed, I accelerated the car.  
"Where to next?" came a voice from behind, catching me as I was zoned in on the road.  
"Ah!" The car screeched as I swerved in shock.  
"You're a moron!" I snapped at Philip, adjusting my seat angrily. "If we got into an accident and my soul ended up in heaven, I'd hold your soul responsible until the next life! What you did was reckless! And why are you here? How did you get into my car?"  
"Babe, you're alive! And how can you be so sure you're going to heaven? And what's with this talk of life after life?" he asked.  
"Excuse me, Sir! Wherever I end up, whether in heaven or hell, as long as you're not there, that's heaven for me!" I shot back.  
He was speechless.  
"Well, that's odd, babe! Because wherever you are, that's heaven for me, especially when I'm inside your body."  
I twitched my eyebrow. "Stop being cute, Philip! What are you doing here in my car?"  
"I followed you. You said you were leaving Amir's mansion, so I followed. What did you expect me to do? Stay there and stare at the old folks left at the party?"  
"Are you not occupied? You're trailing me like a stalker!" Does this troublemaker not realize I desire solitude where he's not around? Anywhere works! Just as long as he's not clinging to me like glue! Continuing, I inquired, "And what about your job?"  
"Could it be that I detected concern in you?" he countered.  
"I'm concerned for myself!" I exclaimed. "Where are your bodyguards? I wouldn't want to be mistakenly accused of abducting you-specifically as your kidnapper! That would seriously bruise my ego!"  
He was left speechless.  
 "Shoot!" I exclaimed, ignoring him, and glancing back at the car mirrors.  
"Why?" he asked.  
"Someone is following us!" I exclaimed, and this time, it was real!   
A pink car is following closely behind us.
###chapter 46: Ghosts of Yesterday 
**Sarah** 

Philip cast a glance at the pink car tailing us. 
"Hmm... Who could that be?" he inquired calmly. 
"I'm not sure," I responded, stepping on the accelerator. I noticed the pink car matching our speed, confirming my suspicion that it was tailing us. 
"Do you have a lot of enemies you can't even recognize who's trailing us?" he queried once more. 
"It's as if you're implying I have a bad attitude," I retorted, pressing harder on the gas pedal. That pink car wouldn't outmaneuver me when it came to driving. 
Philip extracted his cellphone from his pocket, dialing Assistant Alex's number. 
"I need answers, now. Find out who owns that car with the license plate..." He recited the plate number to Alex. 
I sped on, the adrenaline coursing through my veins, until the pink car vanished from view, swallowed by the twists and turns of the road. Three agonizing minutes later, Philip's phone buzzed with a response. 
"According to Alex, the owner of that pink car is Jessica Woods," Philip announced. 
What on earth does that person expect from me? Jessica's clearly in the throes of madness at the moment. Confronting her now would be like stepping into a raging storm without a compass. It's simply not the right time to challenge her insanity. 
"Where are you staying?" I inquired of Philip. 
"Apartment number 5," he promptly responded. 
I was momentarily speechless. Philip seemed quite stubborn about residing in the same apartment I was renting. Yet, considering the circumstances of our previous encounter, his claim seemed justified since he had paid me ten thousand. 
"Why?" he pressed further. 
"I originally planned to drop you off at the hotel where you should stay. It might be unsafe to remain at Apartment Number 5; Jessica might show up. She could already be aware of my staying there," I explained. 
"Perhaps booking a hotel would be wiser," he suggested. 
With a heavy sigh, I relented to Philip's proposal. Pulling the car to a stop outside the imposing façade of the Heritage Harvest Hotel, exhaustion weighed heavily upon me. I had no energy left for further debate. Spending the night at the hotel seemed like the most sensible choice. 
Philip booked a family room, his arm draped over my shoulder as we went to the rented room. Once inside, he pulled me close and kissed me against the door, sending a delightful shock through me. 
In his tender caress, I felt the soft whisper of his fingertips tracing the contours of my jawline, his heartbeat a symphony that resonated with the depth of our bond. As our lips met, our tongues waltzed in a graceful rhythm, merging into a perfect union of souls. With each breath, our spirits intertwined, creating a harmonious melody. 
But every time I'm near Philip like this, all my self-awareness seems to vanish, leaving me adrift. As our lips parted, a torrent of questions flooded my mind-about Philip's intentions involving me-but I knew delving into them would only cause me more pain. Fear and uncertainty gripped me; I felt lost... 
"Do you want something to eat?" he asked, breaking the silence. 
It was then that I realized I hadn't eaten yet. "Yes, please," I replied. 
While Philip called for food, I went to one of the bedrooms. Shedding my clothes, I hastily washed away the remnants of the day, the steamy water offering a momentary escape from my racing thoughts.  
Amidst the rush of water, my mind flitted to Amir's complicated relationship with Jessica, the unsettling behavior of that woman following me after Amir broke up with her, my relationship with my father, and, most significantly, my tangled emotions for Philip. 
I used to be head over heels in love with him. Even now, traces of that enduring love lingered in my heart, but a newfound wariness tempered it. I knew I had to guard myself against trusting Philip again. 
Wrapping a robe around me, I sank into the plush cushions of the couch, my gaze drawn to the breathtaking view beyond the expansive glass windows. The vibrant lights of the distant Las Vegas Strip bathed Henderson in a captivating glow, offering a moment of respite from the tumult within me. 
The depth of the darkness enveloped me, exhaustion dragging me down like an anchor. 
*** 
**Philip** 
I have a strong yearning to win Sarah back. She's the only one who helped me see things clearly. In her presence, I find solace, a tranquility that eludes me elsewhere. Her beauty radiated even in our banter, even when she jested, labeling me as stupid or moron; it's amusing, and I can't help but smile because I find her adorable. 
Reflecting on our past, I remember a different Sarah when she was my wife. She seemed reserved, almost timid as if she didn't want to converse with me. 
"Sara?" I called out, scanning the room after I received the food delivery.  
There she lay, nestled on the couch, her delicate features softened in slumber. Seeing her like this brought a sense of peace. Her face was tranquil and serene.  
Gently, I brushed a stray lock of hair from her face, aching for her to return to me. 
"You must come back to me, Sarah," I whispered. 
Carefully, I lifted her and laid her on the bed. Despite my desire to do many things to her body, I recognized her exhaustion. 
Deciding to check the adjacent room, I called Alex once more. "Discover what plans Ms. Jessica Woods harbors for Sarah. She trailed us earlier." 
"That's insane, boss!" Alex exclaimed. 
"I know. She's delusional if she thinks I'll let her near my woman." 
"Boss, I have an update on the investigation you assigned to me. It appears that Madam Cornell was the one who sent Sarah to the OB-Gyne last year. We couldn't locate the doctor who performed the procedure on Ms. Sarah's womb, but we did find the nurse who was a witness to everything. Would you like to meet with the nurse to ask some questions? I can have someone from the team reach out to her. She's been reassigned to Henderson." 
Glancing at my watch, my eagerness to uncover the truth weighed heavily upon me. "Yes, arrange for me to meet with the nurse and have Trey stay with Sarah while I'm away." 
"Understood, boss!" 
After making the call to Alex, Megan was on the line again. Our frequent communication centered on our work together, particularly on the Sci-Fi project, where she was involved in the movie production. 
"Hello," I greeted. 
"Philip, we have an upcoming event next week. I thought I'd give you a heads-up so you can prepare," Megan informed me. 
"Please relay that to Alex. He handles my schedule for meetings and works," I replied casually. 
"He's already aware. I saw it marked on your office schedule." Megan had been my companion for trips and business events over the past year. 
"Alright." 
"Philip, I heard that the Benner-Woods wedding is off. What else are you doing in Henderson?" she asked, her tone laced with insecurity, almost like a jealous girlfriend. 
"Megan, we need to rethink how we communicate if you're going to ask me personal questions like this." 
"What?" she exclaimed. 
I didn't wish to cause Megan further distress. After all, we share a history as friends and former partners. Despite past complexities, I endeavor to maintain a respectful rapport, especially considering her ties to my mother. However, her behavior as a business associate is beginning to test my patience. 
"Is this about my inquiry? I apologize, Philip. It's just... I can't help but feel uneasy. I don't want to see you with Sarah," she confessed. 
Her response only fueled my annoyance. 
"Very well, I'm ending this call," I stated firmly, hitting the end button. 
A knock on the door interrupted the moment, announcing the arrival of three bodyguards, including Trey, who often accompanied Sarah at Serenity Pines. 
Quickly donning a long black coat in preparation for venturing outside, I addressed Trey sternly, "We can't afford any mishaps with Sarah, especially after her escape in Highland Hills." 
"I'm sorry, boss!" Trey responded, his expression reflecting remorse. 
Without further acknowledgment, I followed the other two bodyguards who were to escort me to the nurse. I needed to uncover the truth of Sarah's pregnancy!
###chapter 47: Closed Ward 
**Philip** 

In the quiet embrace of the Henderson night, nestled amidst the desert's whispers, lies the serene sanctuary of the Henderson Memorial Clinic. Bathed in the gentle glow of moonlight, its modern façade exudes a tranquil aura, inviting those needing healing to find solace within its walls.  
I'm trailing behind the two bodyguards as we walk down the hallway toward the ward where Nurse Samantha Hayes is assigned. She's the same nurse assigned to the OB-Gyne department when my mother brought Sarah last year while in Highland Hills. 
"Excuse me, we're looking for Nurse Samantha Hayes," one of my bodyguards addressed the nurse at the station. 
The nurse eyed us with suspicion, likely due to our imposing presence. "May I inquire as to who they are?" she questioned, her tone wary. 
With a reassuring smile, my bodyguard responded, "My mother was hospitalized last year, and Nurse Hayes took care of her. It was at Highland Hills. We just wanted to check in on her at my mother's request." 
"Ah, I see," the nurse nodded, seeming to relax. "She's gone to the canteen for lunch." 
"Thank you!" my bodyguard acknowledged graciously, and without further delay, we proceeded towards the canteen. Navigating through the corridors, we quickly located the canteen with the assistance of a few directions from passing staff. 
Upon entering, our eyes landed on a petite woman in scrubs seated alone at a table. She's engrossed in something on her mobile phone, a headset covering her ears, oblivious to our approach. 
My two bodyguards smoothly claimed the seats adjacent to her, catching her off guard while I settled before her. Fear flashed across her face as she realized she was already cornered. But I swiftly intervened before she could scream or cause a scene. 
"Nurse Hayes, rest assured, we have no intention of causing you harm. I have an important question to pose to you." Without delay, I slid a cash card across the table. "It holds five thousand dollars in exchange for a five-minute conversation. Do we have a deal?" 
She hesitated; her eyes flickered from the cash card to me, recognition dawning on her features. 
"You're Philip Cornel!" Shock colored her features. 
"I'm pleased you recognize me. In that case, no formal introductions are necessary," I remarked casually. 
"Everyone in Highland Hills knows you! What could you possibly need from me? Why have you come to Henderson? Hasn't your wife caused me enough trouble already?" she asked as she shivered. 
"You were the one who signed Sarah, my wife's medical records, when she suffered a miscarriage last year. I seek the truth. Did Sarah indeed miscarry, or did Madam Cornell coerce her into terminating the pregnancy?" 
"No, please!" Her body trembled with fear, firmly held in place by my two imposing bodyguards. "Please, Mr. Cornel. Find the truth from Madam Cornell or your wife. Spare me from this ordeal. I regret what I did after your wife retaliated." Tears cascaded down her cheeks as she pleaded. 
A surge of confusion washed over me as the words tumbled from my lips. "What did Sarah do to you?" 
"She bought up all the land where my family's house stands just to hike up the rent and manipulate everything to her liking. And then, for months on end, she tormented me with dolls and reminders of her baby," the nurse explained, her voice trembling with fear.  
"It was relentless. I felt like I was losing my mind, unable to focus on anything but her sinister pranks. Eventually, I had no choice but to flee Highland Hills. But her cruelty didn't end there. Eventually, my family uncovered the true motive behind Sarah Cornell's torment. My mother passed away upon discovering my actions." 
"What did you do?" I probed, my gaze narrowing in suspicion. 
"I merely followed Dr. Smith's instructions," the nurse confessed, her voice heavy with guilt. "It turned out she and Madam Cornell were acquainted. The doctor offered me money, knowing full well my mother's dire need for financial support due to her prolonged illness. Desperate, I agreed to Dr. Smith's scheme. Last year, your mother took Madam Sarah to the hospital, specifically to Dr. Smith's clinic. Your mother wanted to confirm if Sarah was pregnant." 
A shiver ran down my spine as the puzzle pieces fell into place. 
"Dr. Smith administered Sarah Cornell a sedative before the procedure," she continued, her words punctuated by my growing horror. "When Madam Cornell learned of your wife's pregnancy, she wasted no time in arranging for the termination. We reported it as an ectopic pregnancy to expedite the procedure. No one visited Ms. Sarah Cornell at the hospital for three days, leading us to believe she wasn't-" 
I slammed my fist on the table, the wood groaning in protest, fearing the nurse. Anger surged through me, hot and fierce, mingling with the cold grip of despair. Three days. Three days and no one had bothered to check on Sarah. Three days of agony, and I had been thousands of miles away, oblivious to her suffering. 
"I'm sorry! Please, Mr. Cornell!" The nurse before me trembled, her voice quivering with fear. "I just followed your mother's wishes. I couldn't do anything else." 
Exhaustion weighed heavily upon me, clouding my mind, but I couldn't afford to succumb to it now. I needed answers and clarity amidst the chaos that surrounded me. 
"Why did Madam Cornell want Sarah's baby gone?" I demanded; my tone icy with fury.  
Two possibilities gnawed at my mind: her doubt of the child's paternity or a far more sinister truth-that I was, in fact, the father. Truth felt like a distance in the haze of uncertainty, slipping through my fingers like grains.  
"All I understood from their conversation with the doctor was Sarah Cornell was crazy, and Madam Cornell doesn't want any further connection with your wife. I only overheard this when another woman from your family arrived. They don't want trouble involving the baby while there's a divorce on going... I'm unsure! Please, Mr. Cornell, please spare me" 
I closed my eyes tightly, frustration boiling within me. "Where is Dr. Smith?" 
"I don't know, sir," came the shaky reply. 
After conversing with the nurse, I felt disconnected from myself as I traversed the hospital corridor back to my vehicle. Fear and anger coursed through me, leaving me trembling. Sarah's inability to forgive me weighed heavily on my mind.  
How could I blame her? I was grateful she could bear to face me, though I felt utterly undeserving of her gaze. Yet, amidst my turmoil, a seed of resentment sprouted. How could she keep such crucial information from me, especially as a father? Did she doubt my willingness to support our child? 
Instead of disclosing the news about the baby, she opted for a divorce. Does she perceive me as incapable? Recalling my reaction to her deception, forcibly removing her from the villa on our third anniversary, I can't help but wonder if she felt unsafe with me. 
Returning to the hotel, a shroud of melancholy enveloped me as I trudged back to our room. Pouring a drink, I sank into the couch, consumed by regret. After a while, from the bedroom, a rustle broke the silence, and there she stood-Sarah, my wife. 
Rising to my feet, I confronted her, my voice trembling with the weight of unanswered questions.  
"Why keep the truth from me?" I demanded, my voice laced with frustration. 
Confusion clouded her expression. "What truth?" she countered. 
I exhaled sharply, the words tumbling from my lips in a rush. "Why didn't you tell me about the baby? Why opt for a divorce instead? Why keep your pregnancy a secret?" I questioned her, trying to piece together the puzzle that, in my opinion, still had many pieces missing. 
To my astonishment, she was just as clueless as I was, and then came the panic attacks.
###chapter 48: Traces of Heartache 
**Sarah**  
As I stirred awake, the room enveloped me in a shroud of darkness, leaving me momentarily disoriented. Recollections trickled back, reminding me of my recent journey with Philip to this hotel, shadowed by Jessica's persistent pursuit in her unmistakable pink vehicle.  
My gaze fell upon Philip, seated on the couch as I exited the bedroom. A dim light illuminated his figure, casting shadows that danced across his troubled features.   
Is he drinking?  
Heavy with sorrow, his eyes met mine as I approached, his silent inquiry hanging palpably in the air.  
"Why keep the truth from me?" he asked.  
Confusion clouded my thoughts, grappling with the weight of his accusation. "What truth?"   
He responded to my inquiry about the baby, our child, the infant I had been grieving for until this moment. As I sifted through memories, myriad thoughts crossed my mind, but one remained etched in my heart.   
"Don't you know? You saw my pregnancy report, Philip! You even asked your mother" My voice quivered as the weight of the past threatened to suffocate me once more. How I was mercilessly taken to the clinic by Madam Cornell, the callous disregard for my maternal rights-they clawed at my consciousness, leaving me gasping for air, my vision blurred by tears.  
"Sarah, I had no idea you were pregnant back then! I only learned about your miscarriage when we reconnected... But what baffled me is why you didn't tell the truth that very night you demanded a divorce! You should have told me then about the pregnancy!" His voice grew louder, filling me with fear.  
I looked at him, feeling a wave of disgust. "How, Philip? You treated me like dirt, just like your parents! You led me on, accused me of deceit, inflicted pain for three years, betrayed me..." Tears welled up as memories of the anguish at Serenity Pines flooded back. "I witnessed you gifting Megan the sapphire necklace. I saw..."  
My voice faltered, stifled by the imminent cascade of tears.  
"You went to the restaurant?" he asked, guilt evident in his expression. "Let me explain, Sarah..."  
"No! The point is, you don't love me, Philip! So, how dare you cast doubt on my decision to seek a divorce then? I confronted you! And without a flicker of hesitation, you coldly affirmed that there's no love between us!"   
Philip stood there, utterly dumbfounded.  
My chest constricted, tears streaming down my face uncontrollably. "How dare you, Philip?!"  
"Sarah..."  
My vision blurred, darkness encroaching as anger fueled my sobs.  
Philip approached me tentatively and then pulled me into a hesitant embrace. "Are you alright, Sarah?"  
I shook my head, gasping for air. "I-I can't breathe."  
"Where's your medicine?" he asked urgently.  
"No!" I had to resist. I needed to see Josh.   
Philip scooped me and gently carried me to the couch. I nestled into his embrace, settling onto his lap as he cradled me close, my head finding refuge against his steady heartbeat. I surrendered to his touch, finding a moment of peace in the familiar scent of his clothes, letting his presence soothe the turmoil within me.  
"I'm sorry..." Philip whispered multiple times, his hand soothingly running through my hair.  
Philip's apologies failed to ease my mind. The truth is, I crave independence. I want to achieve success on my terms. I long to retaliate against those who harmed my baby! I want them to experience the pain that haunted my heart, hoping that by doing so, the ache and agony I've endured for a year might finally begin to fade away.  
***  
I stirred awake, roused by the soft morning light seeping through the curtains. Unsure of the hour, I found myself still cradled in Philip's embrace, which surprised me; I hadn't realized I had drifted off in his arms.  
A pang of sorrow washed over me. The conversation from the night before yielded one certainty-Philip remained unaware of the truth.  
At one time, I wouldn't have been shocked if Madame Cornell had painted Philip as the villain, the one seeking harm for our baby.  
'That old woman!' I muttered, my eyes narrowing with determination. 'She has to pay.'  
Standing up slowly, I adjusted my robe, casting a fleeting glance at Philip, who was still peacefully asleep on the couch. After a quick freshening up, I emerged from the bathroom to find Philip still on the couch.  
Approaching the table laden with food, my stomach growling with hunger. At that moment, I didn't care about the flavors or whether the dishes were still as delicious as before. All that mattered was satiating the gnawing emptiness inside me. I reached for the garlic bread, hastily tearing off a piece and stuffing it into my mouth. Along with it, I grabbed three extra cookies, craving the comfort they promised.  
Peeking outside the suite, I spotted Trey.  
"Madam?" Trey's surprise was evident as he saw me emerging in just a robe.  
I offered no response, instead choosing to quietly close the door behind me as I walked down the hallway.  
"Where are you going?" Trey persisted, trailing after me.  
"To my car," I replied tersely.  
"With that attire?" Trey's concern was palpable as he glanced back.  
"Trey, I'm no longer Philip's wife. You don't need to watch over me."  
Despite my protest, Philip's bodyguard persisted in following me down to the parking lot, and I relented. After all, Philip's staff mirrored his annoying nature.  
I scanned the lot, hunting for my parked car amidst the sea of vehicles. Trey remained steadfast in his pursuit. His unwavering dedication to fulfilling his boss's directives added to the mounting pressure throbbing in my temples.  
Nevertheless, I chose to brush aside his presence. As I slipped into the driver's seat, Trey desperately attempted to detain me, his imposing figure blocking the driveway.  
"Madam Sarah, please! I'll be in trouble with the boss if you leave without his knowledge!" he pleaded, his voice tinged with urgency.  
"Tell your boss to go to hell!" I snapped sharply, inching the car forward. "Trey, believe me, I won't hesitate to drive right over you if you don't move!"  
From his expression, it was evident that he was indifferent to the situation.  
"Unbelievable!" I sighed in exasperation.  
"Please, Madam Sarah, at least let me accompany you. I'll take the blame if the boss gets upset. Besides, you won't even notice me following you. Please..." Trey persisted, adopting a tone of desperation.  
"Fine! Get in!" I relented, annoyed by the tactics employed by Philip's bodyguards. They always play the sympathy card with me, as if I'm responsible for their boss's bothersome behavior!  
Trey stepped aside from blocking the driveway and settled into the passenger seat.  
"Ugh, annoying," I grumbled, shaking my head.   
All I wanted was a moment of peace without Philip. I drove towards Apartment Number 5.  
As I exited my car after I parked in front of my rented residence, Jessica swiftly approached me, catching me off guard as I hadn't noticed her pink car. Did she wait for me?  
The corners of her eyes shadowed with intensity.  
"You're really a slut!" she accused sharply because I donned a hotel robe. "Who were you with last night, huh?" she demanded, her voice strained with jealousy and anger.  "You won't escape what you did to me at my wedding! You'll see how ugly things can get, you ugly bitch!"  
Before I could even react, she hurled the contents of her bottle in my direction, the liquid inside splattering dangerously.
###chapter 49: Severing Bonds 
**Sarah** 

Trey swiftly positioned himself in front of me, shielding my trembling form from Jessica's wrath. The liquid Jessica had flung splattered onto his broad back, emitting an ominous wisp of smoke, indicating that the bottle's contents were anything but ordinary.  
Jessica's eyes widened with fury. "Why did you intervene? You fool!" she spat at Trey. 
Fear rippled through me, a shiver tracing down my spine as I grasped the gravity of Jessica's unraveling demeanor. 
"Madam Sarah, keep your distance from that woman! She's not herself," Trey warned with urgency, lacing his words. Hastily, he shed his jacket, a precaution against the unknown substance Jessica had hurled. Only then did I spot the lingering splatters marring his frame, a stark reminder of the danger. 
"You're stupid! I will kill that bitch!" Jessica seethed, her fury propelling her toward me, but in that instant, all I wanted was to strike her with whatever was within reach.  
Closing the distance between us, I delivered a forceful punch to her face. Yes, that's right!  My palm was already stung against her surgically altered cheek. Yet, I was resolute in my determination to teach her a lesson. 
"Ahhh!" Jessica's scream echoed her threats. "I'll sue you! Help! I'm being assaulted! This woman is a monster! She's attacking me!" Jessica's desperate cries reverberated through the air.  
I have had enough of understanding her. I wanted to throw this bitch into the ocean and let the sharks deal with her! 
With firm resolve, I gripped Jessica tightly. 
"I didn't provoke you, you imbecile! Call the cops, Trey!" 
Thank heavens Philip's bodyguard accompanied me; otherwise, this lunatic might have hurled that liquid at my face! 
The police responded promptly. Within minutes, they arrived on the scene while Trey restrained Jessica, who appeared to be completely unhinged. I provided the officers with dashcam and surveillance footage from Apartment Number 5. 
I called Amir to inform him of his ex-fiancée's alarming behavior. 
"Amir, you need to come to my apartment," I said urgently. 
I recognized that he might not have been in the best frame of mind, and honestly, I hesitated to involve him in this morning's chaos. 
"What now?" he asked wearily. 
"Your ex-fiancée almost seriously harmed me. The police informed me the substance she threw was acidic. Fortunately, Philip's bodyguard was with me. I hate to drag you into this, but what other choice do I have, brother? She's been stalking me since last night." 
Currently, Jessica is in police custody due to her highly agitated state. She's visibly distressed, crying, and exhibiting dramatic behavior reminiscent of a stereotypical Karen. The police have had to restrain her in the vehicle as she's proving difficult to control. Dark circles under her eyes suggest she hasn't slept. 
"No! It's not me! It's that bitch Sarah! She made me do this! She hurt me! Look, officer!" She pointed accusingly at her eyes, and I couldn't determine if my punch had caused the damage. 
I was certain that by now, Amir had heard Jessica's frantic voice, even through the phone.  
"I'm coming over," he stated. 
I immediately called Jakob, conveying the message that we'd meet in the afternoon owing to the unexpected arrival of Amir's former fiancée at my apartment. 
Some parts of Trey's neck, splashed with acid, had been treated. The liquid had caused burns on his skin, and the police were questioning me for a statement. Thankfully, the wounds were minor, but the thought of Jessica orchestrating this chilled me. Was disfiguring my face her ultimate intention? 
Frustration gnawed at me relentlessly; consecutive problems prevented me from resting. 
First, Philip's car pulled up, followed closely by Amir's. But it was the unexpected arrival of Bronn's car that truly caught me off guard. 
"Sarah!" Both Amir and Philip called my name simultaneously before exchanging concerned glances and hurrying toward me. 
Of the three men, my arms instinctively reached out to Amir, even though Philip had opened his arms. 
"Are you alright?" Amir asked, his concern evident. 
"Yes. I'm truly sorry," I apologized to Amir. I nearly brushed off Philip as he grew increasingly agitated, but he grabbed my robe and pulled me towards him, inspecting me closely. 
"Amir!" Jessica's face lit up. She attempted to distance herself from the officer's grasp, but they refused to let her go. "Amir, you're here! I know you still love me!"  
Hope radiated from Jessica's expression, as if she believed Amir might still reconcile with her. 
"No, Jess. I'm severing all ties with you permanently. I won't forgive you if anything happens to Sarah," Amir said with ice in his voice. 
"No, it's Sarah! She's the one behind the trouble at the engagement! She sabotaged our relationship! I won't betray you again, Amir! Please, please reconsider!" Jessica pleaded. 
"It wasn't Sarah! I'm the one who operated that drone!" Amir revealed. 
"What?" Jessica couldn't believe it. 
"I witnessed your betrayal, Jess! I exposed to our guests the despicable things you did to me! Today was meant to be our wedding day, but instead, you'll be facing consequences for harming Sarah and her bodyguard!" Amir's words hit Jessica like a ton of bricks, realizing that Amir had indeed ended their relationship for good. 
"Take that woman away! Bring her to the police! I don't want to see her again!" Amir exclaimed, his temples throbbing as he rubbed them. 
Jessica wailed as the officers escorted her towards the waiting vehicle. 
"Are you alright?" Bronn asked me. 
"Yes, I'm fine. How did you find out about what happened this morning?" I inquired. I wouldn't be surprised if Philip were here; Trey likely reported to him. 
"Jakob," Bronn replied. 
"Oh! I never thought you would have a good relationship with him," I remarked, considering my friend's recent engagement with BM Technologies. 
Philip abruptly pulled me away from Bronn. "She's mine!" 
I rolled my eyes, Philip exuding his alpha vibe once again as if he were staking a claim. Who gave him the idea that I belonged to him anyway? 
In the background, Jessica's voice pierced the air with chilling determination. "I'll seek revenge! I'll make sure you're ruined, Sarah!" 
Her threats were all too familiar, yet they never failed to unsettle me. 
Continuing her tirade, she added, "Amir, is this what you want? I'll find Marcus Blackwood and ensure that woman meets her end by his hand!" 
Fear coursed through me at the mention of that name, Amir's eyes narrowing in response. 
"I want that woman out of my sight!" Amir's chest heaved as fear drained the color from my face. 
I glanced at Amir, desperation evident in my eyes. "How did Jessica find out about Marcus Blackwood?" 
Guilt flickered across Amir's face. "I'm sorry I'll double your security." 
Before Amir could react, Philip grabbed me, wrenching me away from my brother. "I'll be the one to double Sarah's security!" 
Amir's jaw tightened. I sensed the urge rising within him, a fiery impulse to unleash a punch toward Philip's impeccably handsome countenance. "You're a fool! How can you do that when I don't trust you?" 
My body trembled as I interjected, "How could you, Amir? Why did you tell Jessica?" 
"I'm I'm sorry" 
"Who the fuck is Marcus Blackwood?" Philip's rage surged, unable to comprehend the fear in my eyes or Amir's mounting anger at the mere mention of that name. 
Trey's gaze met mine, a flicker of recognition igniting in his eyes at the mention of Marcus. 
"Don't you dare raise your voice at me, Cornell! I'm not one of your subordinates!" Amir's eyes narrowed with a warning. 
"I'll be the one protecting Sarah, as my bond with her surpasses any of yours."  
Philip's smug expression grated on my nerves. 
Amir couldn't help but snicker. I shot him a warning glance, silently urging him not to fuel Philip's ego. 
Bronn's chuckle only served to escalate Philip's irritation. 
Clearing my throat, I started, "Marcus Blackwood is..."
###chapter 50: Shades of Kinship 
**Philip** 

"Marcus Blackwood is..." Sarah started. 
"The man my mother had an affair with," Amir continued, his voice strained with tension. "He's dangerous!"  
But his words only left me more perplexed. 
"What connection does he have to Sarah? And why would Jessica claim Marcus poses a threat to her life?" 
Sarah and Amir exchanged significant glances. 
"He's my biological father!" Sarah revealed, her expression tight. "I don't understand why you confided in Jessica about Marcus," she probed, directing her statement at Amir. 
As I pieced together the puzzle, my brow furrowed. Could it be that the bond between Amir and Sarah stemmed from their intertwined family histories-Amir's mother's involvement with Marcus Blackwood, who happened to be Sarah's father? 
"I'm sorry. I confided in Jess because I thought she'd be my wife. I thought she'd become part of the Benner Family," Amir explained. 
Sarah trembled with fury, her emotions palpable. 
"All of you, just leave!" she commanded, striding into the apartment. 
"Sarah!" Amir called after her. 
"Go home, Amir! Your office has enough to contend with after last night's scandal. I've had my fill of drama!" Sarah retorted. 
I trailed after her, only to be halted by Bronn, who stood in my path, his hand halting my progress. Irritation flashed across my face as I brushed his hand aside. 
"She said everyone should leave!" Bronn warned. 
"Mr. Martin, I live here! I share this apartment with Sarah," I asserted firmly. 
"What?" Amir interjected. 
"You heard me correctly. I understand we have our differences, but Sarah is my wife! I will protect her. Your focus should be ensuring that your ex-fiancée doesn't do anything foolish to harm Sarah!" I insisted. 
Amir's expression contorted with anger. "Coming from someone who hurt Sarah last year! I witnessed her devastation! I saw how broken she was, so spare me the lectures, Cornell. We both have faults, but I'll ensure Sarah won't be drawn back to your side!" 
I clenched my jaw, grappling with the truth in Amir's words. I had indeed hurt Sarah, and my family had played a part in her pain. 
Amir's gaze narrowed as he went back to his vehicle. I turned to Bronn, but he remained silent, heading to the car without another word. I quickly checked on Trey to ensure he was okay before leaving. 
*** 
**Sarah** 
As I disregarded the three men outside the apartment, the exhaustion that started from the previous night's heated argument with Philip weighed heavily on me. Fear crept in, but all I craved at that moment was a soothing, steaming bath to ease my nerves.  
The thoughts of Marcus Blackwood's past attempt on my life would have to wait for another time. 
After a long shower and a change into comfortable pajamas, I gathered my belongings for the trip to Highland Hills. Fatigue weighed heavily on me already! That's when Philip entered my bedroom, and I realized I couldn't evade his question any longer. 
"I'll protect you," he murmured, his concern evident. 
"You can't," I replied, my hands still busy with my belongings. He hadn't shielded me from his mother's evil deeds; how could I expect him to safeguard me from Marcus? 
"Sarah, Trey told me about Marcus's dark reputation-he's a notorious killer! Authorities are still hunting him down. Why does he want you dead?" 
"Because I'm his daughter, Philip! That's the sick truth of it." It was the driving force behind my decision to shed my identity as a Benner princess, relinquish custody of Grandpa Mitchell, and marry Philip aside my deep affection for him. It also explained the sudden withdrawal of Mr. Benner's affection, my father's abandonment, and the stark dissimilarity between Amir and me. 
Amir, with his brunet hair and Germanic features, bore no resemblance to me. Even our eye colors differed; he was blue, mine gray. No one would mistake us for siblings, which fueled Philip's irrational jealousy.  
Our shared bloodline with Grandpa Mitchell was the only tie that bound us. 
Philip intently gazed at me, catching me off guard as he stole another kiss.  
"What's that for?" I inquired once he released me, feeling the heat rise to my cheeks. 
"Because you were thinking about another man and because you let that crazy woman get under your skin," he retorted. "She's obviously jealous, yet you keep getting closer to Amir." 
I rolled my eyes, not wanting to entertain thoughts of Amir just yet. Despite managing a major automotive company, he let a woman worm her way into his confidence, even divulging secrets about my identity to her. It infuriated me. 
"Anyway, I'm exhausted. Leave the room! You're giving me another headache!" I declared, finishing my work before jumping and collapsing onto the bed. "Hmmm" I moaned, relishing its softness. 
My body still ached, longing for proper rest after Philip and I had spent the night on the couch. Before I could fully register it, the space beside me shifted. Philip slipped in beside me, enveloping me in his arms. He nestled his head in the crook of my arm, his comforting embrace encircling my waist. It was as if he were a clingy koala finding solace in his tree. 
"Get out of my room! I need to sleep!" I protested. 
"Me too!" the brute replied. "Don't you have any pity for me? My back and arms ache from that couch. Let me get some proper rest, too." 
"But that's my boob, Philip! You're practically snuggling into my chest!" I exclaimed, resisting the urge to smack him for invading my personal space. 
"You don't have boobs. It's so flat that I couldn't feel anything," he reasoned. 
My eyebrow twitched. "Now you're criticizing my small boobs? I never even brought up-" 
"What, Sarah? My dick is fine. I know it's a perfect size, especially when he's inside your body." 
"Enough already." My face flushed with embarrassment. Whatever! I just wanted to sleep! 
Eventually, I drifted off, soothed by Philip's presence and scent-a truth I couldn't deny. 
*** 
After a few days, I returned to Highland Hills. However, I opted to stay at Amir's villa this time instead of returning to Serenity Pines. 
Despite Philip's vigorous protests, staying at Amir's villa was the right choice for me. 
I saw a message from my brother. 
***Amir:*** *The authorities have approved for Jessica to stay away from you and refrain from any contact. She has been strictly prohibited from approaching you. Unfortunately, her actions led to her father disowning her due to the reputation she had brought upon herself. I'm sincerely sorry, Sarah.  She won't be allowed to come near me either.* 
I decided not to reply. His past relationship with a crazy ex-fiancée had me feeling annoyed. I took immediate measures to enhance security around the villa, implementing various surveillance and safety protocols. 
But my plans were thrown into disarray when Megan unexpectedly arrived, her car pulling up in front of the villa. 
What on earth could Megan possibly want now?
###chapter 51: Priority Shift 
**Sarah** 

I noticed Megan emerge from her vehicle and halt before Amir's villa's gate, her presence as unwelcome as a vulture at a feast. 
'What does this woman want now?' 
Activating my security system, I strode to the gate; my curiosity piqued yet tempered with disdain. 
"Yes?" I inquired, meeting her gaze. 
Her face was a mask of contempt. "So, it's true then? You've taken up residence in this villa near Serenity Pines Estate! Why? Because you want to be close to Philip?" She crossed her arms. 
I allowed a sweet smile to curve my lips. "Megan, I live here to stay away from Philip. If I wanted to be close to him, I'd live in Serenity Pines Estate, specifically in his bed." 
Her fury was palpable. "You're shameless! Since Philip broke up with you, now you're seducing Mr. Benner! Are you his bedmate now that Philip is ignoring you?" 
I rolled my eyes, weariness and amusement mingling. "Honestly, I'm more surprised you're the one paying attention to me. What do you want?" 
"Philip is mine!" Megan declared, her voice a shrill proclamation. 
"Of course, of course." These people are as annoying as Philip! Shaking my head, I picked up the hose from the lawn and, with a flick of my wrist, sent a stream of water cascading over her. 
"Ahhh! You wretch! Help! This woman is assaulting me!" 
"Megan, you came here to bother me. I have the right to do whatever it takes to make you leave because you're disturbing me!" 
She gritted her teeth and warned, "Get ready for me in the office! Remember, I am your boss! I will make sure you leave Highland Hills!" 
I no longer care! Does she think I want to stay here in Highland Hills? I just shook my head as she sped off in her car. Why are the people around Philip, besides Jane, all crazy? 
After Megan left, I checked my phone to see if Jane had responded. I had invited her to Amir's villa to catch up before I started on the project. I saw two messages: one from Philip and one from Jane. 
Philip: Let's meet tonight. Go to Serenity Pines Estate for dinner. 
Then I read Jane's message: Hi, love! Let's meet tonight at Quill Tavern. I am in a bad mood. I still can't fix my damaged hair. 
I thought about what Madam Cornell did to her. That old woman! She's crazy! 
Because I'm lazy, I decided to call Philip via video. With Jane being his sister, I needed his help. Philip answered almost immediately, his handsome face filling the screen. He looked impeccable in his perfectly tailored Armani suit. 
"Yes, babe?" he said. 
"Can you help me book at Coiffures?" I asked. It's a famous salon near Luminary Productions, and most of their clients are celebrities from Philip's company. It's nearly impossible to get an appointment there. It could take weeks or even months for Jane and me to accommodate. But we might have a chance if Philip reserves a slot for us. 
"You don't need to pretty yourself up just for our date later," he said casually. 
I was rendered speechless. Who on earth gave him the notion that I'd be going on a date with him tonight? I watched as he subtly signaled to someone off-camera. 
"Sir, I don't need to be pretty myself because I know I'm already beautiful!" 
He felt speechless. 
"Besides, I don't have a date with you! I'm meeting Jane. We're having a girl's day, so I'm not going to Serenity Pines Estate! She's the one who needs an appointment at the salon, not me." 
"Boss, is that your wife?" I heard someone ask on his end. 
"Yes, is there a problem?" Philip replied. 
"No! No problem at all, boss!" a chorus of voices responded. 
My cheeks flushed with heat. "My goodness! Don't tell me you're in a meeting; they all heard my complaints?" 
"Don't worry! No one will dare mention that you scolded me and dared to stand me up on our date." Philip's eyes narrowed a silent warning to those around him. 
I was mortified. My words echoed in my mind, each one amplifying my embarrassment. 
He smiled devilishly at the camera. "I'll pick you up at Coiffures later. Bye!" 
I was shocked when the connection with Philip was cut. That brute! 
After the call with Philip, I rifled through my wardrobe, searching for something to wear. The state of my attire struck me with sudden clarity-I desperately needed new clothes. As I glanced in the mirror, my eyes lingered on my chest. 
Philip had commented that it was so flat that he almost felt nothing. Irritated, I squeezed it, wondering if he was right. 
That rascal! Mine are at least a B cup! He probably said that just to mess with me. What a pervert! He insulted my boobs like that!  
I quickly texted Jane, letting her know I would pick her up after Philip's driver fetched me at Amir's. 
When I arrived at the Cornell mansion, I saw Jane waiting at the gate. She wore sunglasses, but they couldn't hide the telltale redness around her eyes, evidence of recent tears. 
"Are you alright?" I asked her gently. 
"I can't fix my hair," she sighed. "I booked an appointment at Coiffures, but next month is the earliest slot they could give me. There's a grand ball happening, and they're swamped with their celebrity clients." 
Jane had been away from the city for a while, so it wasn't surprising that some establishments didn't recognize her. 
"I called your brother," I said, hoping to ease her worries. "Don't worry about it. He helped me get you an appointment today." 
She turned to me, a hint of surprise in her eyes. "It seems you and Brother Philip are getting along well." 
"Of course not! He might do anything to get a slot for you. I told him I'd bring you along. But if it were me needing help, he probably wouldn't care," I said casually. 
Jane finally smiled. 
As we rode in the vehicle, I caught up with Jane. She filled me in on our project at Luminary, which revolved around Philip's production work. Jane would handle the overall design while I represented BM Technologies. 
Upon arriving at our destination, we were intercepted by Jane's cousin Rebecca, who was already conversing with the woman at customer service. 
"Well, well, well, look who's here," Rebecca said, crossing her arms. 
I ignored her and instead greeted the woman in the lobby. "Hello there!" 
"Hello, Miss" The woman paused, waiting for my name. 
"I'm Sarah Mitchell. We're here to see Brandy. We have an appointment this afternoon," I replied. 
"And when did you book, Ma'am?" the woman asked. 
"About an hour ago, I believe," I answered. 
Rebecca burst into laughter. "Gosh, Sarah! You seem to think that booking guarantees you an immediate slot! I also had a sudden outing, and just yesterday, I was pleading with them to fix my hair." She glanced at the woman in customer service. "Don't trust them. She just wants to get ahead in the schedule." 
The woman scrutinized me from head to toe. "Ma'am, I'm sorry, but it's impossible to give you a slot right away if you just called now." 
"Call Brandy. I'm sure he knows what I'm talking about, and he'll see me," I replied. 
"Sarah, I never thought you were so innocent. Don't you know that Brandy is the number one stylist in this salon? If others have full schedules, especially Brandy!" Rebecca commented, her tone dripping with condescension. 
I knew about it! Because Brandy was my hairstylist, but instead, I responded, "Why is there a buzzing bee in your shop? A certain someone has been commenting since earlier, even though we're not paying them any attention." 
"You-!" I didn't expect Rebecca to be so easily provoked. 
"Just look for my name or Jane Cornell," I instructed the receptionist. 
She checked the schedule, clearly irritated. With a sigh, she said, "Ma'am, there is no slot for Sarah Mitchell or Jane Cornell in our schedule. You're causing a disturbance in our salon." 
"Sarah, let's go..." Jane said softly, trying to pull me away. 
But seeing Jane's earlier smile when she learned that Philip had made arrangements, I decided not to leave. I didn't want my friend to be disappointed. "Tell Brandy to come here, or I will fire you!" 
Rebecca laughed loudly. "She's lost it!" 
The woman rolled her eyes. "Security!" she called out, clearly thinking I had lost my mind. 
The salon staff promptly escorted Jane and me out, which only fueled my anger. 
"Call your brother and tell him to buy this shop and blocklist your cousin!" I demanded, turning to Jane. 
"Me? W-why me?" she asked, bewildered. 
"Of course! Because you are Jane Cornell! Tell him they kicked us out!"
###chapter 52: Taste of Privilege 
**Sarah** 

While we stood outside the salon, Jane responded to my comment, "My brother has too much on his plate, Sarah. He was scolded by our father yesterday when he visited the mansion." 
"Huh? Why?" I asked, confused. I had been preoccupied with work alongside Jakob and had no idea about Philip's daily life. 
"It's because the board members and some supporters of Luminary Productions already know you two have separated. Brother Philip has often brought Megan to various business events and social occasions for the past year. The public seems to think they're in a relationship. Dad wants to make that news official to protect Brother Philip's image with our business associates. Madam Cornell also pushed this to validate Philip and Megan's status." 
"Few people know you are married to Brother Philip. From the beginning, others assumed Megan was married to the Cornells. Brother Philip has been under immense stress but hasn't shown it. I don't want to add to the problem, Sarah." 
A thought struck me: perhaps Madam Cornell had indeed planned to hide me away at Serenity Pines Estate for three years to keep my identity in Philip's life a secret. 
I didn't want to dwell on the past anymore. It only brought sadness, made me question my actions, and risked triggering another panic attack. 
"Sarah? Jane?" We both turned towards the voice. It was Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt, Philip's friend, grinning as he approached us. "What are you doing here?" 
Dr. Vanderbilt, with his silver-gray hair that only added to his cocky demeanor, stood there with dark roots showing about an inch at the base. 
Jane spoke, "Dr. Ethan, the salon threw Sarah and me out. They humiliated us." 
I chimed in after Jane, "They claimed we didn't have an appointment! But Philip assured me we had a booking with Brandy. I mean, I was getting a manicure. Jane was the one who had her hair appointment with Brandy." 
The doctor grimaced. "So, Philip was the one who booked the appointments for you?" 
"That's right!" I said. 
"Hmm. If that's the case, it's unlikely there was no appointment. Come!" Dr. Ethan led us back inside. 
As we reentered the shop, the receptionist's eyes narrowed, and Rebecca's face twisted into a sneer. "You're unbelievably persistent and irritating!" The woman spat.  
Rebecca laughed, ringing with mockery.  
"I already told you to leave! I'm going to call the police because you're disturbing our salon!" the receptionist angrily scolded Jane and me. 
"Who said you're calling the police?" Ethan asked from behind us. 
"D-Dr. Vanderbilt!" The receptionist bowed her head. "These two insist they have a reservation this afternoon, but I can't find anything on the schedule!" 
"Ethan!" Rebecca's face lit up with surprise. She pointed an accusatory finger at me. "That woman thinks she can sneak into the salon and skip ahead of those waiting patiently for their appointments. I've been here for ages, waiting for my turn, practically camping out at this doorstep, hoping to get a slot!" 
"That's right, Dr. Vanderbilt! They're causing trouble in our store," said the receptionist. 
"Dr. Ethan, are you a regular here?" Jane inquired, her curiosity piqued as we both observed Ethan's familiarity with the woman at the desk. 
Rebecca interjected playfully, "Oh, you two are so innocent! The Vanderbilts own this shop!" 
"My sister manages this establishment," Ethan explained with a grin before returning his attention to the receptionist. "Did you remember to check the VIP log sheets?" 
The receptionist's eyes widened as she hurriedly searched her computer for another log sheet, where our names, Jane's and mine, were indeed marked for the VIP section. 
"Oh, my goodness! I-I apologize, Ms. Mitchell and Ms. Cornell!" The receptionist apologized profusely, kneeling on the tiles. "I didn't realize you were expected in the VIP section. VIPs seldom visit, and it didn't occur to me that you might be among them. It's my first time seeing you here." 
"What? What VIP section?" Rebecca stammered, perplexed. "Why haven't I heard of that before?" 
"It's quite straightforward. It's because you're not a VIP," I remarked, provoking her further. 
Rebecca retorted, frustrated, "You-! That can't be, Ethan! I've been a loyal client for years! How come I've never been informed? It's unfair! I demand to speak with your sister!" 
Ethan calmly explained, "We only have ten VIPs in the entire salon branch-myself, Philip, and a select few important people. Are you suggesting you belong among those few important people?" 
Though embarrassed, Rebecca insisted, "That's not what I meant, Ethan. But I believe I should be a VIP! I've spent a considerable amount of money here." 
Lifting one corner of my lips, I remarked, "Rebecca, you're not exactly unique here. Every client at this salon splurges; you're not alone. Unless you're Queen Elizabeth?" 
Rebecca grew visibly irritated with me, but I couldn't help but grin. It was almost too easy to provoke her, much like her friend Megan. 
Ethan clarified, "Philip secured the VIP slot due to his ownership of this property. The others secured their slots through various means. Sarah's assessment was accurate. Just being a regular doesn't guarantee VIP status. If you're dissatisfied, you're free to seek services elsewhere." 
Glancing at the trembling receptionist who had escorted Jane and me out, I could see her fear-stricken demeanor. She had done a poor job indeed. "I warned you earlier about this; I'll fire you." 
"Oh, please, Ms. Mitchell!" 
"You even threatened to involve the police with Jane and me. What if it had been a different VIP customer?" 
The truth was, I wasn't inclined to stoop so low as to request the owner or Ethan to fulfill that desire. However, it was unacceptable for her to scrutinize us earlier as if we were unworthy of a reservation with Brandy. 
"Ms. Mitchell, please! I'm so sorry! I promise to be more diligent!" she pleaded tearfully. 
"I'll handle her, Sarah," Ethan interjected, promptly calling ten staff members to assist Jane and me. 
My attention no longer lingers on her. I playfully stuck my tongue out at Rebecca, further irritating her. With jealousy flashing in her eyes, she hurled her bag and stomped her feet as she watched Jane and me being escorted to the heavenly retreat. 
She's no longer a concern of mine. Today, after the morning's taxing debate with Megan and Rebecca, I crave being pampered and happy! Our destination was the second floor of Coiffures, where the spa awaited us. Nail technicians, masseuses, experts in grooming, and even a bubbling jacuzzi awaited, promising respite. 
As Brandy inquired, I confided in her about Jane's predicament. The spa's treatments were blissful; tension melted away under skilled hands, lulling me into a tranquil slumber. 
When I awoke, I found myself leaning against a broad chest, both of us immersed in the fragrant waters of the tub. Philip's familiar scent enveloped me, soothing my mind with safety assurance. 
"Where am I? Philip?" I murmured, lifting my gaze to meet his, and he greeted me with a tender kiss. 
I felt the warmth of his hand, a tender caress tracing along my body. As his touch pinched my nipple, a shiver of anticipation raced down my spine. A soft gasp escaped my lips as his touch found its mark, his lips following a path of desire along my neck.  
At that moment, lost in his touch's embrace, the world's cares faded away like whispers in the wind, leaving only the exquisite sensation of his caress against my skin.
###chapter 53: Unraveling Hearts 
**Sarah** 

Philip's touch ignited a cascade of sensations. His fingertips, tracing every curve of my body, transported me to a realm where only he and I existed. 
I gasped, clutching his arm as I melted against his solid frame, relishing the intimate caress of his fingers trailing down my abdomen, slipping beneath the delicate fabric of my thong. 
"Sarah, you have a way of driving me wild like this. I thrive on the impossible, my thoughts in a haze. All I desire is to claim you," Philip murmured, his warm breath sending shivers down my spine as he explored the depths of my intimacy. 
His gaze smoldered with desire, yet there was an undeniable depth to his affection. At this moment, trust flowed freely between us, permitting him to explore every inch of my being. 
A series of soft moans escaped my lips as his touch teased my most vulnerable places, sending waves of pleasure coursing through me. 
"Philip! Aah" I gasped, biting my lip to stifle the sounds threatening to escape as he expertly caressed the delicate contours of my slit. 
"That was sweet, Sarah... Just remember to keep your moans hushed; we wouldn't want any eavesdroppers," he whispered, his voice husky with desire. With one hand sending me to the brink of ecstasy and the other alternating between teasing my nipple and caressing my chest, they created a delightful dilemma. His lips sent shivers down my spine as he kissed my neck and whispered seductive promises into my ear. He orchestrated a symphony of pleasure that left me utterly entranced. 
At that moment, uncertainty wrapped around me like a fog, leaving me adrift and unsure of my next move. Philip's presence consumed my thoughts entirely, his gaze intensely locking onto mine.  
"I like that look in your eyes," he murmured before his lips captured mine in a hungry kiss. 
His touch ignited a fire within me, his fingers tracing patterns across my nipple, coaxing a response from my eager flesh. As my arm draped around his neck, I felt a surge of desire coursing through me. He took one hard crown into his mouth, and I craved more of his touch. 
"I'm far from finished," Philip whispered against my heated skin, his words fueling my anticipation.  
With a gentle strength, he lifted me, my legs instinctively wrapping around his waist as our kisses grew more urgent. 
Clad only in a thong while he stood completely naked, the fabric between us heightened my anticipation as my core throbbed against his hardness. The water rippled softly as he crossed to the other side of the tub, gently placing me on the edge with a hungry gaze. With deliberate care, he removed my last garment down my legs, his reverence for my body tangible in how his eyes caressed my skin. Each tender kiss ignited a cascade of sensations, fueling the fire between us. 
Philip worshipped my body, which left me breathless. Starting from my wet feet, he trailed kisses along my legs, igniting flames of desire with each touch. His lips journeyed upwards, settling between my legs. Peering at me, he caressed his two fingers against my folds, erupting the fire inside me.  
"So wet," escaped his lips.  
"Philip..." I whispered his name, unsure if it was a plea or simply a murmured desire. "I want you," I pleaded softly. 
"Patience," he replied calmly before he set his tongue, indulging in the sweet torment of my sensitivity.  
"Ah... Oh, God!" I gasped, my hand instinctively bracing myself as Philip delved into his expertise. Uncertain of where to position my legs amidst the whirlwind of sensations, I surrendered to his ministrations. He licked me, sucked me, all while he studied the myriad expressions dancing across my face, his free hand teasing and tormenting my breasts with practiced skill, pinching them, kneading them.  
"I told you that you are mine, Sarah! Your body speaks volumes," he murmured, a possessive edge to his voice as he reinforced his claim. 
Maybe Philip had been right all along. His tantalizing promise lingered on my lips as I gulp, igniting a fervent desire within me. Gasping, I arched my back, surrendering myself to his mouth. 
"Yes..."  
His hand ventured lower, aiding his mouth's ministrations on my clit; his finger traced circles over my folds, igniting another wave of moans as I edged closer to climax. It's effortless for this man to elicit such responses from me. 
I bit my lip hard as I cum, surrendering to the ecstasy. Licking my lips, I gaze imploringly at him as he nestled between my thighs. 
"More?" he inquired. 
Admitting my craving felt embarrassing, yet he pressed on with lips that eagerly sought mine, radiating hunger. 
I ache for his possession, to feel him deep inside me completely. Once more, he lifted me, his hardness pressing onto me, unhindered by any thin garment this time. Perched on the tub's edge, my form luxuriously sprawled over his. 
"It's your chance now, Sarah"  he murmured, coaxing me. 
This man! He was determined to demonstrate how I crave this, how I desire him. Yet, I'm surrendering all self-restraint. Every part of me pulses with longing. 
Raising my hips, I align myself, guiding his shaft to my entrance. My vision blurred, my body ached for him, my thighs quivered as I lowered myself; our bodies trembled with shared longing. 
"Ahhh" In the warm embrace of the moment, I let out a contented moan. With each breath, I surrendered to the exquisite sensation enveloping me. Inch by inch, he filled me up, spreading my legs wider, and my heart raced with anticipation.  
"Philip!" I gasped, a breathless acknowledgment of his complete presence inside me. 
His gaze darkened, mirroring the intensity of our connection as he delivered a playful spank on my butt.  
Grasping at him for support, I moved and swayed my hips on his top as he gripped my ass cheeks, surrendering myself to the rhythm of our bodies intertwining, each movement a symphony of pleasure that reverberated through my entire being. 
Our eyes locked in a passionate exchange before our lips hungrily sought each other out, a desperate need driving us forward. As Philip delved deeper, I felt my very essence crumble beneath his touch. 
"Sarah, come with me," his voice echoed in the heated air, mingling with the sheen of sweat that adorned our bodies as I whispered his name in fervent repetition. 
"Philip!" My voice rang out, a melodious blend of pleasure and yearning, as every fiber of my being trembled under the cascade of sensations engulfing me. And in that exquisite instant of mutual surrender, as Philip's release merged with mine, a surge of love and fulfillment surged through me, swelling my heart with an indescribable richness. 
Tenderly, he traced his fingers along my cheek.  
I was lost in his gaze, his words washing over me like a soothing balm. "You are an amazing woman, Sarah,"  he murmured, his lips brushing against me in a tender caress. 
It was a tender gesture, gently coaxing my heart to once again place its trust in him. 
*** 
My thoughts drifted away from the present after slipping into a comfortable black dress.  
Fear gripped me, pain echoed in my heart, and I lost myself in uncertainty.  
The second chance I refused to give Philip weighed heavily on my mind, haunting me like a ghost, and leaving me unsure of my next move.  
'Sarah, you utter fool!' I scold myself silently. 
Because I know, as I surrendered my heart to Philip a million times, his return to Megan will mock me relentlessly, a haunting specter that flickered across my television screen, a painful reminder of my perpetual heartache.
###chapter 54: Bound by Love 
**Sarah** 
My thoughts were a tangle of confusion as I emerged from the bathing area, freshly changed into new garments. Jane greeted me immediately. 
"Did you relax?" she asked, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush. I noticed the other salon staff shared her embarrassment; one even cleared her throat nervously before slipping into the bath area for cleaning. They must have heard my moans through the thin walls. 
"D-did you hear it?" I stammered. 
Jane nodded, her blush deepening. "And everyone else. But don't let it bother you. What can they do about it, really? Besides, you and Philip are-" 
"Ex-spouses!" I interjected. Shocks! It was scandalous! That's when I truly took in Jane's transformation. "Wow! You look stunning, Jane!" 
"Really? Thanks! I can't believe they managed to do something with my hair. I'm happy!" she said, her spirits visibly lifted. Though her eyes were still red from crying, her whole demeanor had brightened. Her hair was now shorter, accentuating her sophisticated aura. Brandy had truly done an excellent job! 
"It's because you're naturally pretty!" I said with a faint smile. "By the way, where is your brother?" I had just noticed that Philip was nowhere to be seen. 
Jane's expression grew serious. "Megan's villa is on fire. Philip rushed there with Dr. Ethan to check on her." 
I winced, a knot forming in my stomach. Just great. After everything that went down between Philip and me, after I convinced myself that my feelings for him were indestructible, after he intruded on my peaceful spa day, now he's with Megan. How am I to convince myself he doesn't harbor love for her? 
"Love, what's wrong?" Jane's observation pierced through my brooding thoughts, her concern evident as she observed the shadows in my eyes.  
I mustered a faint smile. "It's nothing, really. Just feeling a bit foolish." 
"Oh, love, don't be silly," Jane reassured me. "Philip and Megan are just classmates, and Megan's family is out of town. Philip's just being caring, that's all." 
Right, like that changes anything.  
"Shall we head to the bar you mentioned?" I redirected the conversation, masking my inner turmoil. I couldn't let Jane suffer the weight of my mood, not after her earlier distress. 
"The Quill Tavern?" 
"Yes, precisely." I'm eager to unwind, something I haven't managed to do lately. 
That's when I noticed the flood of texts from various people: Philip, Jakob, Bronn, Amir, and surprisingly, Josh.  
Curiosity piqued, I decided to delve into Josh's message. 
It read: Madam Sarah, let's meet. I've been swamped with work lately, but I finally have a chance to break away.  
Upon reading that, I turned to Jane and asked, "Would it be alright if I invite someone to join us at the bar? I just need to speak with him briefly." 
"Of course!" Jane replied. 
As we stepped outside the salon, Trey was waiting. My expression soured upon seeing him, but he made no complaint as he escorted Jane and me to the designated pub. 
Jane had reserved a private room for us, away from the bustling disco and rowdy patrons in the public area. A server was assigned to cater to our needs within the room. 
"Please wait out here," I instructed Trey before we entered the private space. 
His brow furrowed, silently probing the room with his gaze. 
Before he could protest, I added, "Jane and I need to discuss something privately. It's girl talk." 
Jane forced a smile at Trey. 
"Alright, I'll wait out here. Just be cautious with your drinks," Trey replied. 
'Whatever!' 
We entered the VIP room and promptly placed orders for food and drinks. As Jane and I settled into our respective single couches, I reviewed the messages on my phone. 
***Amir:*** *Sarah, it might be best for you to return home to Grandpa Mitchell in Dubai.* 
***Bronn:*** *Let's arrange to meet once I'm in Highland Hills.* 
***Jakob:*** *How are you? How's everything with your husband?* 
He was deliberately provoking me, itching to get under my skin. 
***Philip:*** *I've got something important to attend to. Catch you later.* 
Important It indicates just how important Megan truly is! 
The need for a drink consumed me like a relentless fire! Thus, when the margarita I had requested graced the center of our table, I swiftly gulped its contents. Jane noticed my actions. 
"Are you alright?" she inquired. 
I glanced at her. Damn it! Why does her brother bear such a striking resemblance to my friend? Jane reached out and clasped my hand; it was clear she had sensed my discomfort before. 
"You can confide in me, you know. I'm always here," she whispered. 
As her best friend, I knew Jane was my only confidante. "Jane, I don't even know where to begin." 
"Is it about Madam Cornell? I'm truly sorry, Sarah. At one point, I came close to confiding in my dad about her bullying behavior. However,  he promptly encouraged me to excel at work, emphasizing to me that Brother Philip and I should be strong.  I hesitated to disclose Madam Cornell's mistreatment, fearing his reaction given his prior advice." 
I was deeply moved by Jane's predicament. 
"I love your brother, Jane. How do I begin to untangle them?" 
"Aww!" Tears welled up as Jane embraced me, a bitter reminder of the turmoil within. 
"I've given up so much, Jane. I can't bear to love him any longer, not when there's a harsh reality looming between us. He's Madam Cornell's son, a truth that taints every moment. Despite knowing he never truly loved me, my heart still clings to him, a foolish prisoner of longing. Am I a fool, Jane? I long to despise him, to use my anger as a shield against Madam Cornell's cruelty, but I can't bring myself to hurt Philip." 
"My heart agonizes, torn between forgetting and holding onto him. I yearn to extinguish this love within me." 
If only I could unlove Philip, perhaps then, life would relent in its cruel grip. 
"I want to apologize. Last year, you confided in me about what happened with my brother and your baby. I didn't confront Philip about it or disclose your secret to him. I avoided discussing you altogether. Madam Cornell threatened me, saying she'd kill you if I spoke to Philip about the baby. She also threatened to sabotage my education in London. For that, I'm deeply sorry, Sarah. I feel powerless to change what occurred." 
I was utterly stunned. That conniving woman!  
That was one of my questions. I nearly couldn't fathom Philip's claim of ignorance regarding what happened to my poor baby. Yet, my disappointment cut deeper when I realized Jane had kept silent. Why did she withhold such crucial information from me? 
Nonetheless, isn't it Philip's responsibility to uncover the truth? He failed to do so because he doesn't love me! 
Moments later, Jane excused herself, mentioning that she needed to seek Mr. Cornell's permission to stay with me at Amir's villa for a while. 
I despise this emotion! I abhor feeling sorrowful! 
Three imposing figures breached the room while I was alone. "Well, well, well... What do we have here?" one of them growled, their presence casting a sinister shadow over the space. 
Arching an eyebrow, I pondered whether Trey might be trailing Jane. 
"Would you like to entertain us, baby girl?" inquired another. 
"We noticed your friend left. It's a pity because you both are quite attractive," remarked the third. 
"I must agree. The ones lacking in appeal are certainly the three of you!" I retorted. 
Observing them bribe the server to have the man vacate Jane's rented room, I simply shook my head. 
"Did you just insult us?" one of them attempted to intimidate. 
"Ugh, how exasperating! And do you even dare to question the truth of it?" I shot back with seething intensity. 
From my bag, I withdrew a sleek black .45 caliber gun. With eyes darkened and gritting teeth, I declared, "Do you know what? I'm in the mood for causing some pain tonight. My husband left me for his mistress! So, if you're up for a game, come on! I'll ensure this room turned bloody!" 
I slammed the gun onto the table with a resounding thud, hoping to convey the seriousness of my intent. They scattered like frightened mice. 
"Tsk! Idiots!" I muttered, pulling the trigger in frustration, an unexpected burst of pungent pepper spray filled the air-it wasn't a firearm, but a pepper spray gun. 
Before I could process my annoyance, a hulking figure barged into the room.
###chapter 55: Unveiling the Stranger 
**Sarah** 

Josh strode into the room, his brow furrowed with concern. "Who are those men?" he inquired, his voice laced with curiosity. It was evident he had crossed paths with those troublemakers. 
"Just a couple of idiots," I retorted, my irritation palpable. 
He settled onto the couch beside me.  "If you managed to come here to the bar, it means you're doing good." 
"Yes! I wanted to take the medicine I used to rely on during panic attacks, but I resorted to eating instead. I also calm myself down and avoid negative things, focusing on what can help me." 
Josh's gaze remained fixed on me.  "That's good to hear! But what usually triggers your panic attacks?" 
I met Josh's gaze, unsure if I should disclose the truth. But since I had promised to trust him, I said, "Every time I remember the immense pain from when your boss and I were still married, I feel like I can't breathe, and my vision blurs or darkens. Surprisingly, since I started spending time with Philip, I rarely feel that way. I wanted to understand why." 
"Because you mentioned he was also the source of your attacks. Somehow, your inner self wanted to heal using the same cause but overall, it was you, Madam Sarah. You wanted to heal on your own. I also think the activities you do help a lot." 
Josh was right. I filled my days with meaningful activities and refused to let toxic influences affect me despite trouble consistently finding its way to me. 
He added, "I didn't expect you to adjust so quickly." 
"I followed your suggestion. The problem is, I drift off to sleep too quickly, and when I do, it's usually a deep slumber." Earlier, I was so out of it that I didn't even realize Philip did things inappropriately. That pervert! 
"Your brain is still adjusting. The medication you were given was too strong," Josh observed. 
That's the frustrating part. That doctor should be facing charges! 
As I glanced at Josh, a wave of questions flooded my mind. Should I be more vigilant around Philip's bodyguard despite my decision to trust him? I couldn't shake the uncertainty about his true motives.  
"Josh, who are you really?" I blurted out. 
He met my gaze squarely. "It's better if you remain unaware, Madam Sarah." 
"But you previously mentioned needing to retain your job, which led to me lifting your one-month suspension. What drove that decision?"  
Why does he continue to stick with Philip? If I press further, Josh will surely catch on that I've been digging into his background. Sometimes, less is more. 
"Because I need the money," Josh replied. 
My mouth fell open. I hadn't expected such a straightforward answer from Josh. But why does he need the money? 
"Don't doctors make a decent income? Why would you consider becoming Philip's bodyguard?" 
I observed Josh squinting, his body trembling with anger. What triggered this sudden reaction? As he tightly shut his eyes, it became apparent that he was struggling to maintain composure, a valiant effort to prevent an escalation and confront his emotions head-on. 
"Forget it! I won't answer," Josh declared, retrieving a brown envelope from his squared bag. "I know you're seeking retribution against Madam Cornell and Dr. Morgan. These files will help you..." 
My brow furrowed as I accepted the thick envelope, curiosity urging me to peek inside. 
The door creaked open, and Jane's surprise was evident as she entered, catching sight of Josh's presence. 
"Josh?" Trey inquired with tension. "What brings you here?" 
I explained, "I invited him over. He's just dropped something off for work. It's not that I doubt you; it's a simple task." 
Trey cast a sharp glance at Josh and then at the envelope, a flicker of suspicion crossing his features. Surely, he wouldn't dare pry into its contents, would he? 
"Madam Sarah, I must be leaving," Josh announced. 
"Hold on," I halted him, swiftly reaching for my phone and capturing a snapshot of him. 
"Madam Sarah, that's illegal," Josh protested, his tone serious, teeth clenched in frustration. 
"I'll just save it as a contact photo. It's a habit of mine. Besides, you look quite charming tonight!" 
Damn it! My heart's racing! 
Jane discreetly cleared her throat, casting a pointed glance at the vigilant bodyguard. 
"Remove it immediately!" Josh's voice carried a sharp edge, sparking Trey's vigilance.  
With a roll of my eyes, I flashed my phone screen at Josh, conveying my compliance.  
The screen showed 'Delete?' Without hesitation, I tapped the 'Okay' button. 
"Are we settled? I wanted to update my contacts with pictures. Why are you so upset?" I asked, trying to diffuse the tension. 
"Sarah, you should have asked for permission first. If you did this to others, they would be upset too," Jane interjected with a hint of disapproval. 
"I apologize. I'm fortunate to have understanding friends," I expressed, acknowledging my misstep. 
Ignoring me, Josh watched as I took out my wallet to pay for the consultation. His expression soured when I handed over the payment. 
"Thanks for your help!" I waved the envelope cheerfully. Despite his initial reluctance, he eventually accepted it, his jaw stiffening with an air of pride. I couldn't help but wonder why he seemed so adamant about it. 
As Josh and Trey exited the room, I dismissed their conversation from my mind. Examining the contents of the envelope, I discovered photographs of Madam Cornell and her schedule, alongside incriminating documents pertaining to Dr. Morgan's illicit transactions. 
As I gaze upon Jane and myself, there's no retreat from the path I've chosen. I'm set to execute the very action that strikes fear into Madam Cornell's heart-to strip her of her title as Madam Cornell.  It's evident she's leveraging Philip to maintain her status, so he can't be her top priority. 
"I promised my dad I'll stay at your villa," Jane said. 
"Perfect timing! I want you all to myself!" I exclaimed, embracing her. "Let's venture out together and find men who'll give us genuine love!" 
She grinned, and our glasses chimed. 
Jane was nearly intoxicated when we arrived back at Amir's villa. Despite her haze, my thoughts remained lucid. Through the car window, as the car glided past Serenity Pines Estate, Philip and Megan were unmistakably entwined in each other's arms at the gate. 
"Hold on! Is that Megan?" Jane's observation caught me off guard. 
I shrugged. "Possibly. Unless your brother's a skilled womanizer who can summon any woman to my villa!" 
It grated on my nerves, truly! 
Once inside Amir's villa, I guided Jane to her room before succumbing to my frustration with a solitary feast. Today was a test, and I proved a lot of things! 
Settling at the kitchen island with a bowl of ice cream, I initiated a video call with Jakob. With my laptop positioned before me, his voice came through the speakers, accompanied by the rhythmic tapping of his typing. 
"How are you, doll?" Jakob's inquiry reached me as I savored another spoonful of ice cream. 
To ensure Jane was in her room, I meticulously scanned the hallways and other areas via surveillance but found no trace of her anywhere in the villa. This confirmed she was indeed inside her room. I value her privacy and respect boundaries, which is why I haven't installed a camera in the room I've provided for her use. 
"I'm not feeling great, to be honest. I'm still engrossed in revising the codes you requested," I responded. 
"Have you been drinking?" he inquired. 
"A bit, but my intoxication level is inconsequential. Don't fret about my state; I'm still perfectly clear-headed, especially since I'll be beginning my job at Luminary Productions tomorrow morning. Jane and I had a casual conversation at the pub. My only concern is that our tool might present challenges at the office." After all, we haven't tested it on anywhere else yet. 
"So, how did it go? Did you uncover anything about Josh?" I inquired. 
Earlier, I had shared a photo of Josh with Jakob. While I may have indicated to Josh that I deleted it, retrieving it from the recycle bin was simple. 
The revelation about Josh's true identity left us stunned.
###chapter 56: Secrets in Shadows 
**Sarah**  
I remembered the day Jakob and I had our conversation through video call, just after I finished arranging my things. It was the day I arrived at Amir's villa from Henderson.   
The kitchen island where I now stood, nibbling on sliced fruits, was the same spot where our conversation had taken place.   
Josh came to mind while we discussed my security and other work-related matters.  
"I'm confused about Josh," I said, thinking I needed to meet him too while staying in Highland Hills.  
"Josh, who?" Jakob inquired, his fingers halting on the keyboard as he shifted his focus entirely to me. Even at this late hour, he remained dedicated to the BM Technologies office.  
"Philip's bodyguard. Remember when I asked you to investigate him, and we discovered that his identity records were created only six months ago?" I explained.  
"Oh, that guy!" Jakob said, finally recalling. "Do you have his photo?"  
"Why would I have a picture of Josh? And what would you do with it anyway?"  
"I'll use the facial recognition tool I developed," Jakob replied.  
"You made an app?" I was taken aback and surprised at the depths of Jakob's talents. How had I missed this during our time working together? "Anyway, I don't have a photo of Philip's bodyguard, but he was captured by the surveillance cameras at BM Technologies' building."  
I also dreaded the thought of my ex-husband questioning me again with, 'Why do you have another man's photograph?'  
Jakob's memory flooded back as he recounted the day Josh made an unanticipated appearance at the BM Technologies office. It was the moment when Josh handed me the medication, shedding light on its true nature. "Ah, yes! I remember now! That day at BM Technologies when you had an unexpected guest!" he exclaimed  
I affirmed his recollection with a nod.   
"When exactly was that again?" Jakob inquired, his fingers dancing across the keyboard with increased speed.  
The date was etched vividly in my memory, coinciding with my scheduled move to Apartment No. 5. I relayed this information to him. "Hold on. Are you planning to-"  
"Shh!" Jakob cut in, hushing me with a gesture. "I've got it!"  
I was utterly speechless.   
My mind raced with concern. Wasn't that Bronn's domain? What if BM's security systems detected any tampering with the camera footage?  
However, just as easily as Jakob got the file, he soon expressed his frustration upon encountering an error. "Oh, darn it! The bodyguard's image on the camera is too blurry. He's also wearing a baseball cap, obstructing key facial features needed for a proper scan. I require a clearer image. Could you provide one so I can yield better results?"  
"Absolutely!" despite being aware of the difficulty.   
My hands trembled with apprehension as I aimed my camera at Josh, striving for a clear image. Despite Trey's reassuring presence before me, Josh's imposing presence loomed over me, making me feel uncertain.  
I couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden behind his inscrutable expression.  
Bringing my focus to the present, I sat on the kitchen island, indulging in spoonfuls of ice cream while Jakob remained in his softly lit Henderson apartment.  
"Josh confided in me about his need for money, and something about his demeanor convinced me he was being genuine. He even verified his profession as a doctor and handed me this." I revealed to Jakob through the camera, displaying the envelope's contents.  
"Hmm,  what's in there?" Jakob inquired.  
"Documentation regarding Madam Cornell and Dr. Morgan-the physician designated to me by Amir. Now, it's making me question everything. Why is he helping me? Should I be wary of him? Though, to be fair, he hasn't posed any threat yet. In truth, he's come to my rescue on numerous occasions."  
"I'll run your bodyguard's photo through the system now. Just a moment," Jakob muttered, his fingers dancing over the keyboard.  
"Screen share!" I interjected, eager to uncover the truth about Josh.  
"Sure thing!" Jakob's screen popped up, and we both watched as the facial recognition software whirred into action.  
The progress bar advanced steadily. 10%... 50%... 80%...  
Approaching the completion, the pace decelerated marginally. 97%, 98%, 99%...  
Finally, a collage of images materialized from various sources-hospital records, social media, and more. I couldn't help but gasp at what Jakob and I had stumbled upon.  
"Impressive tool you've got there, my friend!"  
He grinned in response.  
"So, he was really a doctor," Jakob commented as we sifted through the pictures.  
In one of the images, Josh is dressed in blue scrubs, his grin radiating for the camera. Some pictures are too shadowed to discern his demeanor, while others show him interacting with patients.  
Jakob scrolled down further, and our jaws dropped at the sight of the next photo. In this particular snapshot, Josh had his arm casually draped around Megan, planting a tender kiss on her cheek. Their intimacy was undeniable.  
Seeing another man with Megan, even just in a photo, was almost jarring, given her usual attachment to Philip like a leech!  
"Damn! Isn't this Megan?" Jakob blurted out as if he were the only one noticing.  
"That's definitely Megan!" I felt a chill run down my spine. My thoughts were spiraling. Are Josh and Megan involved romantically? Why did Megan return? And what motivated Philip to hire Josh as his bodyguard?  
"Could Josh and Megan be related? Cousins, perhaps?" Jakob's question seemed like a desperate attempt to avoid the implications of the photo.  
"Nope. C-can you check the date when the picture was taken?" I stammered out, my mind racing with the implications. What details had I unwittingly divulged to the bodyguard? Could he use this as leverage to manipulate me into his camp?  
What does he require of me? How has he fallen under Philip's control now? This barrage of questions is giving me a headache.  
"The photo was taken two years ago," Jakob disclosed, his words hanging in the air as I stared at the photograph still linked to my laptop, confirming his statement.  
"Oh my God! Megan wasn't around then, and Philip was still my husband," I remarked; a wave of realization hit me.  
"Sarah, do you know who Megan supposedly ran off with? The man who caused her marriage engagement to Philip to fall apart?" Jakob's tone was serious as he pressed for an answer.  
I shook my head, a surge of agony pulsating through my chest.  
"In that case, Dr. Josh was likely Megan's lover-the one she left with and perhaps the reason you ended up marrying Philip," Jakob concluded, his words sending a shiver down my spine.  
I leaned away from the laptop, struggling to digest the revelation. My friend's deduction seemed chillingly plausible. Though speculative, my intuition echoed Jakob's thoughts, much like it had when I first suspected Josh was a doctor.  
What does Josh want from me? Is he an ally or an adversary?   
And does Philip have any knowledge of this?
###chapter 57: Houseguest 
**Sarah** 

Examining the envelope Josh handed me, I mulled over its contents, weighing the likelihood that it was a gesture of help rather than a potential threat. 
"Could Jane be aware of Megan's ex's identity?" Jakob inquired. 
"Only Megan knows who that is. I'm not even certain if Philip is aware," I responded. 
A chime from the gate startled me, my heart still racing from recent revelations. 
I glanced towards the clock, its hands whispering tales of a time long past midnight. Who, in the dead of night, sought entry at this ungodly hour? 
"Someone's at the gate. Just a moment!" I informed Jakob. 
I swiftly navigated to the surveillance feed focused on the gate, surprised by the identity of the figure outside. 
"What could they possibly want from me?" 
*** 
**Philip** 

As Sarah finished getting ready, I received a frantic call from Megan. Tears obscured her words, but the urgency was clear: there was a fire. Soon after, Ethan handed me a hospital report confirming the devastating news: Megan's villa was engulfed in flames, and preparations for potential injuries were underway. With Megan's parents away on a cruise, Ethan suggested we check on her. 
We arrived at Megan's villa to a scene of chaos, muddy roads crowded with rescuers and firefighters battling the blaze.  
"Goodness!" Ethan voiced our shock at the sight as we surveyed the scene.  
To reassure Sarah, I quickly messaged her, trusting that Jane had already informed her of my whereabouts.  
Me: I've got something important to attend to. Catch you later.   
"Philip!" Megan's voice called out, drawing our attention to her behind the emergency van. Wrapped in a thick blanket while her hair dripping wet, she was being tended to by a rescuer. 
Approaching her, she enveloped me in a tight hug, and I found myself soaked, mirroring her damp state. 
"What happened? Why are you all soaked?" I inquired, concern lacing my voice. 
"I'm not entirely sure myself. I attended an event tonight. Upon returning home, I encountered an unfamiliar vehicle on the road-a grimy old van. Other than that, everything seemed normal. I retired to bed, only roused by the acrid scent of smoke assaulting my senses. Opening the door revealed my villa engulfed in flames," Megan recounted, her voice trembling with the weight of the ordeal. 
Panic seized her as she continued, "I was at a loss for what to do. Instinctively, I grabbed my phone and headed to the window. Luckily, my room overlooked the pool. Without hesitation, I plunged in, though I'm feeling a bit sore now." 
Wracked with sobs, Megan sought solace in my embrace. 
Concern etched Ethan's features as he inquired, "What about your helpers? Are they safe?" 
Megan's tears flowed more freely. "That's my greatest worry. I have only two helpers. One had requested a 7-day vacation, and the other was inside the villa. I'm unsure of her fate, but I pray she's unharmed." 
After hours of battling the flames, the fire was finally subdued. The investigator then questioned Megan again. 
"Ms. Thompson, we have yet to locate one of your helpers, leading us to assume the worst; she's probably dead by now. However, we're diligently working to uncover any leads. Additionally, we've contacted your other helper, who is currently abroad. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests foul play. Have you had any disputes or conflicts with anyone recently?" 
"It's Sarah Mitchell," Megan replied. 
My expression soured. "Are you suggesting Sarah might be behind the arson at your villa?" I asked, incredulous. 
Confusion flickered across Megan's face as she glanced at me. "I-I just answered the question." 
"But it's implausible for Sarah to be involved. She was at the salon owned by the Vanderbilts. Ethan and I were with her earlier before coming here," I interjected. 
"But she could have orchestrated it through someone else," Megan replied tearfully. 
Furrowing my brow, I sensed Megan's apprehension as she avoided my gaze. 
The investigator asked again, "Ms. Thompson, what's behind your suspicion towards Ms. Mitchell as the instigator?" 
"This morning, I visited Sarah's home to check on her, as I heard there's a possibility of us working together again since her return to Highland Hills. My concern lies in her well-being. Given her status as Mr. Cornell's ex-wife, I'm uncertain of her intentions for returning. However, I haven't faced any threats or issues in the past few days or months.  
"There have been rumors circulating about my relationship with Philip, leading me to consider the possibility of jealousy and its potential influence on her actions toward me," Megan explained, her voice quivering. 
The investigator turned to me. "Mr. Cornell, is what Ms. Thompson said true?" 
Through clenched teeth, I responded, "Yes, Sarah is my ex-wife; that much is true. But if you're asking whether she's capable of setting fire to Megan's villa upon returning to Highland Hills, it was I who engaged her services. And I vehemently disagree with the notion that jealousy alone would render her incapable of such actions." 
Megan's eyes met mine, filled with anguish. "Philip, I'm just trying to tell you that things have been tough lately. When I went to see Sarah, she lashed out at me. You can ask your neighbors, and they'll tell you Sarah insulted me. She didn't want me there, Philip. She asked me to leave right in front of Mr. Benner's villa." 
Tears streamed down Megan's cheeks. 
"Mr. Cornell, please don't stress about this. We'll look into your ex-wife's behavior but won't narrow our focus to just one angle. There could be other explanations," the investigator reassured. 
The interview with Megan left me feeling unsettled, and my mood soured. 
"Would it be alright if I stayed with you at Serenity Pines Estate for a while?" Megan inquired. 
"Philip, Megan is in a vulnerable state at the moment," Ethan pointed out. 
However, if Sarah found out, I was unsure how to broach the subject with her.  
"Philip, I have nowhere else to go. My home was completely destroyed," Megan explained, her voice trembling with emotion. 
"Ms. Thompson, we also require your temporary address for the duration of the investigation," the investigator stated, directing his attention toward me. It almost felt like he was insinuating that I should welcome Megan as a friend. 
"Very well. You may use Serenity Pines Estate as a temporary residence. I'll arrange for three bodyguards to ensure your security," I confirmed. 
I escorted Megan to my villa, sensing her lingering fear and disbelief over the possible fate of her maid. As we stepped out of the car, Megan enveloped me in a grateful hug.  
"Thank you, Philip! I'm relieved you're letting me stay here at the Serenity Pines." 
I returned her embrace, my hand soothingly tracing her back. "It's fine." 
Trey arrived with Josh and three other bodyguards in tow. Josh shot me a pointed look before shifting his gaze to Megan, who clung tighter to my arm. Her apprehension was palpable, her throat tightening with anxiety. I maintained a neutral expression, understanding that she was still unsettled. 
"Boss!" Trey called out. "We've safely escorted Madam Sarah back to Mr. Benner's villa." 
"Megan, these are my bodyguards," I introduced each of my men. Aside from Trey, Megan hadn't met the others I often brought out of town for business. Turning to Megan, I added, "Three of them will stay with you in the villa while I'm away." 
Her grip tightened, panic flickering across her features. "W-what do you mean they'll guard me while you're gone? Aren't you staying here with me?"  
Nope! That's not going to work! 
I maintained my composure. "I'll allow you to stay at Serenity Pines Estate with them for protection. So, don't worry." 
Her voice trembled as she pressed further, "W-where are you going?" 
"You needn't trouble yourself over that, Megan," I assured her gently. 
"I-I'm not trying to meddle, Philip. I'm feeling a bit anxious and embarrassed about being here alone while you're away," Megan explained. 
"Please, don't concern yourself with it."  
I plan to ask Sarah if I can stay at her place tonight. That woman had the balls not to reside with me in Serenity Pines Estate, so I'm grateful to have the opportunity to stir things up for her at Mr. Benner's villa!
###chapter 58: House Swap Surprise 
**Sarah** 

"Who is your visitor?" Jakob asked during our video call. To be honest, I was just as stunned as he was. The unexpected visitor left me reeling, especially since I had just seen him embracing Megan in front of Serenity Pines Estate. 
"Philip and his two guards," I replied. 
"Hmm... isn't it late? What does he want from you?" 
"I have the same question." 
I felt a twinge of curiosity but was keen on avoiding a confrontation with Philip. Just then, my phone rang, and to my surprise, it was him calling me instead. 
Jakob raised an eyebrow. "I think your husband won't leave you alone. You better face him," he suggested. 
With an inadvertent thud, I dropped the phone beside the laptop, accidentally pressing the answer button again. 
"Hmp! Let him be!" I blurted out. "Let Philip think that Jane and I might already be sleeping." 
"What do you mean? I heard you, woman!" 
My eyes widened at the faint sound of Philip's voice echoing through the phone. Jakob just shook his head, once again witnessing my antics. 
"Jakob, talk to you again tomorrow. Bye!" I quickly ended our video call. 
"Open the gate, Sarah. I know you're still awake," Philip demanded. 
I couldn't help but roll my eyes before pressing the phone to my ear. "What is it this time? Do you know it's almost dawn?" 
"I know, babe. I've got a watch on my wrist. If you knew it was almost dawn, why are you still chatting with Jakob?" Philip's accusatory tone sliced through the quiet. 
"We're just sorting out work for tomorrow," I fibbed, but it was the most plausible excuse to fend off Philip's interrogation. 
"Open the gate," he demanded. 
"Fine!"  
I made my way toward the gate, intent on fulfilling Philip's request so I could finally find some peace. Pushing open the smaller door nestled within the towering gate, I was met with Philip's freshly showered figure. Clad in pajamas and a simple t-shirt, he seemed prepared to retire for the night. 
As soon as our eyes met, the scoundrel instantly seized me in a demanding kiss. Beside him, Trey and his companion coughed uncomfortably, his cheeks flushing crimson as he averted his gaze. When Philip finally withdrew, my mind still reeled from the intensity of his kiss, leaving me lost in a dizzying haze. 
"Hmmm... It tasted like ice cream," Philip remarked with a smirk. 
The guard beside him blushed even deeper. 
"I was in the middle of eating ice cream when you barged in," I mumbled, feeling my cheeks heat up with embarrassment. 
Philip made a move to enter through the gate. 
"Hold on!" I intercepted, positioning myself to block his path. My arms stretched out on either side, forming a barrier to his entry.  It appeared the brute was intent on stirring up trouble. "You realize it's late, don't you?" I couldn't entertain his antics at this hour. 
"I do, and I'm exhausted," Philip admitted wearily, his tone tinged with resignation. 
"If you're aware it's late and tired, why did you still come here? You should have rested instead of burdening me! I'm preparing for my sleep, too!" I exclaimed. 
"Megan is in Serenity Pines. Her villa burned down, leaving her nowhere else to turn. I offered her refuge there temporarily, given the circumstances. It's too risky for her to seek shelter in a hotel after her villa was deliberately set ablaze," Philip explained. 
I couldn't help but roll my eyes at his explanation as if I hadn't already discerned the situation! I had witnessed Megan in his embrace with my own eyes. 
Philip continued, "That's why I've made the decision to stay here." 
"Whaaat?" I was utterly astonished by his response. "W-what do you mean you're going to stay in my place?" 
"Sarah, we're speaking the same language, you know what I mean. I don't have a place to stay because I let Megan use it in the meantime. That's why I'm going to sleep over here. Come on, I'm feeling the weariness in my bones already. Where can I find your room?" 
My mouth opened wide with utter shock. "Did I misplace my brain back in Henderson? That's the only explanation for my utter confusion over your actions." 
He gave me a soft kiss on my lips. "You refused to stay in Serenity Pines, so I accepted Megan." 
"So, you mean, if I'm staying in Serenity Pines the outcome would be different?" 
"Yes, because I didn't want you to get jealous." 
"Who said I'd get jealous? I refused to live with you, didn't I?" 
"That's why I'm the one who will live with you because you refused me!" 
Speech failed me. 
"Sarah, I'm exhausted. Can we table this discussion until tomorrow morning, please?" he implored. 
As he attempted to step inside the gate, I stood firm, guarding it like Gerard Butler in '300'. "Absolutely not! Philip, are you a moron? Who permitted you to crash here? What sane person lends out their home and camps elsewhere? You let Megan stay at Serenity Pines Estate, and now you show up here expecting to stay at my place? I don't have a spare room! Jane is already using the extra space. Go away!" 
"I'm not concerned about Jane's accommodations, Sarah. All I'm asking for is the room you were occupying. It's well past midnight, and my companions and I are out in the cold. Do you have no compassion?" Philip pleaded. 
His words left me utterly speechless. 
Seriously, why was his predicament suddenly mine to solve after he handed his residence over to Megan? 
With a swift motion, he hoisted me onto his shoulder, intent on gaining entry. 
"Philip!" 
One of Trey's associates inquired, "Did Ms. Mitchell just call Boss Philip a 'moron'? Is everything alright with our boss?" 
"Seems that way. Guess you'll have to get used to these two," Trey replied. 
Once inside Amir's villa, Philip seated me on the sofa and surveyed the surroundings. "Hmm... quite a place!" 
His two bodyguards maintained vigilance, scanning the area. 
"Where's your room?" Philip inquired, turning his attention back to me. 
In a haze of confusion, I gestured toward the building adjacent to the villa's west side. "If you need a place to stay, you can crash there." 
"Is that where you sleep?" he inquired. 
"No." 
"Then why are you putting me in a doghouse?" 
"It's not a doghouse! Ahhh!" I protested as he lifted me once more. I clung onto him tightly, afraid of falling, as he ascended confidently to the villa's second floor, carrying me like a human-sized teddy bear. 
"Where's your room, babe?" he asked, reaching for a doorknob, but I intervened swiftly. 
"Jane's in there." 
The corner of his lips lifted in a subtle smile before he opened the adjacent room.   
Oh well, exhaustion had claimed me, too! I allowed Philip to take the bed, relishing in his warmth as he cuddled me.  
Who in their right mind would pass up the chance to share a bed with Philip? The brute's an exceptional cuddler, after all. 
Yet, as morning dawned, shock rippled through me like a sudden storm when Megan leveled the accusation that I was the instigator behind the fire that consumed her villa.
###chapter 59: Ashes of Innocence 
**Sarah**  
When I woke up, I felt the comforting warmth of Philip's arms wrapped around me, his breath gentle against my neck.   
'Shit! What time is it?'  
My eyes darted to the digital clock on the bedside table, widening in alarm at the numbers staring back at me. I tried to slip out of Philip's embrace, but he groaned in protest and tightened his hold.  
"Philip, I'm going to be late. We have to get up now."  
As I spoke, his rough hand slipped under my shirt, brazenly cupping my breast. He even dared to pinch it and rolled my nipple over his fingers.    
Is this scoundrel seriously touching me in broad daylight?   
"Philip!"   
"It felt nice," he murmured in my ear, his voice rough from sleep.  
"Clearly! Because you're perving on me!" I swatted his hand away. "And don't forget, your belongings are still at Serenity Pines. Moreover, I must get ready for work and ensure Jane feels welcome."  
He blinked awake. "Hmm! Why are you only focusing on Jane? Feed me first."  
I arched an eyebrow. "You're not the guest; you're a troublemaker! I've already let you crash at the villa. Do I have to worry about feeding you, too?"  
"This is what I want," he murmured, caressing softly the spot between my legs.  
Heat flooded my cheeks, and I stepped back. "No! Go home!"  
Breaking free from his embrace, I asserted, "That's enough! I've already allowed you to stay overnight."  
I exited the room, refusing to succumb to his advances. If he wanted me, he would have to earn it. The pain from yesterday lingered, a reminder of my enduring love for Philip.   
The presence of Megan at Serenity Pines puzzled me. Why had Philip allowed her to stay?  
In the kitchen, I busied myself preparing breakfast. The sizzle of bacon and egg filled the air as Jane descended the stairs, her presence bringing a sense of comfort amidst the turmoil of my thoughts.  
"Need a hand?" she offered.  
"Hey, love! Did you sleep well?" I asked, sidestepping the offer.  
"I got a memo about our meeting today," Jane informed me.  
"Me too." Like her, I got the memo and tried waking up earlier.   
Jane raised her glass for a sip of water.  
"Thanks for having me last night, love. You know how I despise the Cornell Mansion. The energy there always feels off, especially with Dad inevitably bringing up my engagement, which puts a damper on my mornings."  
I longed to delve into Jane's thoughts about the engagement arranged by Madam Cornell, but sensing her reluctance to broach the subject, I chose to respect her silence.  
"You know you're welcome to stay with me anytime. Coffee?" I grabbed a cup before she could respond. "The espresso machine is all set."  
"Oh, how sweet! Thanks, love!" Jane exclaimed. As Jane savored her coffee, she caught sight of Trey approaching.  
"Madam Sarah, I have an urgent report for Boss Philip," Trey announced.  
Jane's eyes widened ever so slightly as she realized Philip was in the villa.  
"I'm here," Philip declared as he entered the kitchen.  
"Whoa! Brother Philip, did you spend the night here?" Jane questioned, shooting me a suspicious glance.  
"What? Please don't give me that look. Your brother unexpectedly came to me late at night because he let Megan use the Serenity Pines Estate! "I retorted, sighing.  
Philip turned to me, a smirk playing on his lips. "I detect a hint of jealousy, babe. But there's no need for it; I'm right here with you. And let's not forget, I held you close all through the night."  
I found myself at a loss for words, struck by the sincerity in his expression. My cheeks grew warmer, particularly under the scrutiny of Jane and Trey.  
"I'm not jealous! And who said I wanted you here in the villa?" I retorted, but the jerk ignored me and turned to Trey instead.  
"What's the news?" Philip inquired.  
Trey's expression shifted with concern as he glanced between Jane and me. A knot formed in my stomach, prompting me to give a subtle signal.   
"Feel free to share, especially if it involves me," I interjected.  
Trey then turned to Philip. My ex-husband nodded, affirming, "Go ahead. Sarah must know, especially if her name is dragged into this mess."  
Confusion gripped me. "What do you mean?" I directed at Philip, but Trey continued.  
"It's been confirmed that Ms. Megan's helper was found in the burnt villa. The helper is deceased," Trey disclosed, leaving Jane and me gasping in shock.  
"Has Megan been notified?" Philip inquired.  
"Yes," Trey replied softly. "But, as you mentioned to Madam Sarah, her name became entangled in the investigation due to the deep connections you share with both of them."  
"Wait, what?" I blurted out, my mouth hanging open in disbelief.  
Philip continued with his explanation: "As I mentioned last night, the fire at Megan's villa was deliberate. Megan claims she came to check on you yesterday morning, but you angrily turned her away. Given your recent return to Highland Hills, they're entertaining the notion."  
"They're considering the possibility that I'm involved because of the relationship we have? This could be your fault for having two marriage arrangements!" I accused Philip.  
Philip countered, "How is this my fault?"  
"Because you're a womanizer!" I shot back.  
Philip challenged, "A womanizer is someone who juggles multiple relationships, cheating on all involved. You're the one who has more than one man."  
Surprise rippled through me, widening my eyes in disbelief. "When have I ever had a man?"  
"You've got Bronn Martin, Amir Benner, and that tech guy!" Philip listed off.  
"Jakob?" I clarified.  
"That's right! And add Josh to the mix. You were seeing my bodyguard behind my back," Philip accused.  
I glanced at Trey. It seemed likely that he had informed Philip about my short meeting with Josh the previous night.  
"You're not making any sense, Philip!"  
Aside from Bronn, I couldn't fathom any romantic involvement with those men. And what possible connection could they have to implicating me in Megan's situation?  
"It does make sense because it angered me!"   
Jane, Trey and I were utterly speechless. Philip's logic seemed utterly incomprehensible, as if it belonged to another universe entirely.  
Jane commented, "Are we even discussing the same topic anymore, guys? I'm beginning to worry about getting married."  
Trey cleared his throat before continuing, "The van mentioned by Ms. Megan has also been located-the vehicle she claimed to have encountered on her way home. Ms. Megan's car is equipped with a dash cam, which expedited the investigation. They identified the group responsible for burning down the villa. The issue now is... this group accuses Madam Sarah, alleging she paid them to carry out the act against Ms. Megan."  
The three individuals in the kitchen turned their gaze towards me: Jane, Trey, and Philip. I couldn't help but grimace, incredulous that my name had been dragged into the situation.  
"Boss Alex will update you on other developments, Boss Philip. He's overseeing the investigation," Trey said, seeking permission to depart, which Philip granted.  
I sank into a chair, my mind reeling from the revelation.   
"Sarah, what now?" Jane asked, offering her support by squeezing my hand.  
"I don't know. Frankly, I've had enough of all this drama. Let's dig in!" I declared, reaching for a plate.  
Philip shot me a glance, his head shaking in disbelief, while Jane opted to stay silent.  
"You don't have to worry about it," Philip reassured me, his tone firm.  
"Absolutely! I trust Alex and myself. I'm sure Alex is doing everything to find out the truth. As for me, I don't even know where Megan's villa is. Besides, what would I gain from burning her villa? I'd rather digest the accusation; it will make me full and healthy!"  
"But Sarah, someone died. That's the outcome of burning Megan's villa," Jane interjected, her concern evident.  
I know. That's one of the things on my mind. The truth is, I'm nervous, but I don't want this to cause me a panic attack.  
"I'll simply await the investigation and cooperate with the police. I haven't done anything wrong, so why should I torment myself?" I added, trying to calm my racing thoughts.  
Megan was well aware of my temporary residence at Amir's villa. Who, in their right mind, would willingly dwell in proximity to someone they perceived as a threat? Megan knew I wasn't the one orchestrating the fire, implying she might have been responsible for it herself.  
I have a feeling she intentionally set her own home ablaze.  
"Did she happen to request your permission to stay at Serenity Pines Estate?" I inquired of Philip.  
"Yes," Philip replied.  
It seemed to confirm my initial suspicions-Megan's intention to establish residence in Serenity Pines. While I'm not entirely certain of her motives, her actions cast suspicion on me, pushing me to take action. It's not just about Philip's attention she's after; she's also trying to provoke me.  
However, Megan forgot one crucial detail. Serenity Pines Estate is under my ownership, which means...  
I have the authority to monitor her activities closely.
 ###chapter 60: Burning Allegations   
**Sarah** 
I accompanied Philip to Serenity Pines Estate. 
Philip had rearranged our meeting schedule due to our shared involvement in investigating the tragic fire that had engulfed the witch's residence. As we arrived, I noticed two investigators at the villa engaged in a tense conversation with Megan. 
Megan's surprise was palpable as her eyes met mine, a flicker of disbelief crossing her features. Clearly, she hadn't anticipated my presence at the villa, and the realization seemed to catch her off guard. 
"It's you! You're the reason my home burned down!" she immediately yelled at me. 
'Whaaat?! Is she serious? What did I do?' 
I responded calmly, "Megan, be careful with your accusations. Remember, I can sue you for defamation. And are you absolutely certain that I'm the one responsible for the fire at your villa?" 
"Of course! No one else would do that to me but you!" she snapped back. 
"Megan, don't just accuse Sarah," Philip interjected. 
The woman's teeth clenched and her fist tightened, a testament to her frustration, mainly since it was Philip who stood in defense of me. 
"Calm down, Ms. Thompson. We're here to investigate what happened," one investigator explained before turning to me. "Ms. Mitchell, it's good that you're here. This item was found in a public restroom and was reported to us because it seemed suspicious." 
His colleague placed a bag on the table and opened it, revealing a short wig, glasses, and a familiar-looking dress. It was my dress from the days when Philip and I were still bound in marriage. The garment had remained stored in the wardrobe, untouched for a considerable duration. 
"Are these familiar to you?" the second investigator asked. 
"Aside from the dress, the wig and sunglasses are unfamiliar," I replied. 
"Sarah is the owner of this dress," Philip stated.  
I noticed Megan's smirk, fueling my suspicion that she was involved in the fire at her home.  
The investigators exchanged glances before one of them addressed me, saying, "Ms. Mitchell, we've conducted a preliminary investigation and interviewed the group responsible for burning Ms. Thompson's villa. They claim this is what the person who hired them was wearing." 
Philip's expression darkened as he inquired, "Did you show them Sarah's picture? Did they confirm it?" 
I'm uncertain about what indeed occupied his thoughts. 
The second investigator responded, "Unfortunately, they couldn't get a good look at their client because they were concealed behind a wig and sunglasses." 
Another investigator chimed in, adding,  "Ms. Mitchell, we've discovered this dress is couture, custom-made to fit you perfectly. It's a unique piece, tailored specifically for you." 
"But it's conceivable that someone took this dress from my dresser," I argued. "I haven't resided permanently at Serenity Pines Estate for a year now, and even during Philip and my marriage, there were frequent visitors." 
Philip interjected in my defense, "Gentlemen, consider this: there are household staff who clean the villa. It's plausible that someone took the dress to frame my wife. We can't even be certain if Sarah is the mastermind, as the group you apprehended doesn't recognize their employer." 
"Philip, are you insinuating negligence in managing the villa? That's the only explanation for how someone could have stolen Sarah's dress!" Megan retorted. 
"Indeed, and that's precisely why you're here, Megan," I provoked, feeling the need to confront her. 
She bristled, demanding, "You-! What exactly do you mean by that?"  
"Megan, I heard that your deceased helper was the one from Cornell Mansion," I stated. 
Megan cleared her throat, visibly tense. "And what of it? Is it my crime to employ someone associated with the Cornells?" 
"Gentlemen, it's a well-known fact that workers from Cornell Mansion frequently tend to the upkeep of Serenity Pines. It's conceivable that one of them might have accessed my wardrobe and falsely implicated me as the patron of the group responsible for the tragic events at Megan's home. I'd stake my life on the certainty that I'm innocent," I declared. 
"That's impossible! You're angry at me, Sarah!" Megan's voice rang out in disbelief. 
"Megan, I'm not angry at you," I assured her, my voice catching as I feigned tears.  "Gentlemen, I even extended the courtesy of allowing Ms. Thompson to reside in my villa." I lamented. How could she accuse me of such a grievous deed?" 
"Ms. Mitchell, are you the owner of this property?" 
"Yes! Philip gave this to me as part of alimony," I casually said. "Aren't you surprised? Ms. Thompson is accusing me of burning her house while she lives here in my villa. Surely, no one in her right mind would do such a thing if she suspects someone!" 
Megan cleared her throat. I sensed her panic. "T-this is not part of your alimony? Philip?" 
"Megan, you and Mom were both present when I made it clear that Sarah was the rightful owner of this villa. You heard me say it; you were part of that conversation," Philip clarified, his gaze sharpening with suspicion. It was evident that he, too, harbored doubts about Megan's claims. 
"N-no! What I mean-" 
"In that case, I must ask you to leave, Megan. I'm so hurt" I cried dramatically. "I opened my home to you, Megan. I trusted you. And now, to be accused in such a way... it's simply heartbreaking. How could you, Megan? How could you?" 
The scoundrel came up to me and pulled me into a hug. "Hey, babe, don't cry Maybe you're just freaking out a bit about asking Megan to leave. She doesn't have anywhere else to crash." 
I whispered, ensuring only Philip could hear me. "Please, let go of me. I don't need your comfort." 
But he persisted, tightening his grip. As I glanced at Megan, her jealousy was palpable. It was evident in her eyes that she harbored ill will towards me, glaring daggers as Philip held me close. 
"Ms. Mitchell, please compose yourself. We're examining every possibility, including other potential adversaries of Ms. Thompson," one of the investigators interjected, trying to calm the situation. 
With tears still streaming down my face, I addressed the investigators, "But I haven't done anything, Sir. I'm only twenty-two and innocent! Just because I'm in a May-December relationship with my husband doesn't mean I would resort to arson against Megan's villa." 
The brute clenched his jaw, his words a low growl, "Did you just insult my age? I'm not old!" 
I brushed off his comment and turned back to the investigator. "When did they claim I met with the individuals who set fire to Megan's villa?" 
"Yesterday morning, after Ms. Thompson visited you in the neighboring villa," came the reply. 
"I didn't leave my villa all day, gentlemen. You can review my home surveillance footage; I was there the entire time." 
"But surveillance can be manipulated!" Megan interjected, her voice sharp with accusation. 
"It wasn't me. There's one more thing to consider-the yellow dress. I've been wearing black for months and never worn anything bright yellow." 
Megan pursed her lips, seemingly caught off guard, leaving me to wonder if she was losing her grip on reality or simply oblivious to my recent preference for black attire during our encounters. 
"Ah, but that's your dress!" she exclaimed. 
"Yet that doesn't mean I'll be donning it," I countered, flashing a mischievous grin at Megan. "Much like this villa, I may be the owner, but you're the one residing here. Perhaps you were also the one who donned the dress?" 
Megan's anger flared. "How utterly despicable! Are you suggesting I would set fire to my villa? Philip?" 
Philip sought to soothe her. "Megan, Sarah's merely jesting. You're still welcome here, of course; don't worry." 
Approaching, Alex handed the investigator a USB. "Here's the surveillance footage I managed to retrieve. It appears the maid who recently went abroad was the culprit behind Madam Sarah's missing dress." 
"There's evidence?" All eyes turned to Megan, who tearfully muttered, "How could that woman set fire to my villa?" 
As Megan's accusations shifted in light of the new evidence, I couldn't shake the suspicion of her involvement in the unfolding events. Yet, her motive concerning the deceased maid remained unclear. 
Yet, my concern for Megan had dwindled to apathy. Her actions and motives were beyond my control, so I avoided her drama. 
Heading to the kitchen for water, I discovered broken items strewn about, likely the result of her inability to accept Philip's presence with me last night. Disgusted, I shook my head. Peering out of a small window, I spotted Josh, the bodyguard, walking towards the back of the villa.  
My wariness heightened, and I headed to the bathroom, hoping the small window there might reveal Josh's intentions. 
I was incredulous at what I heard.
###chapter 61: SDE 
 **Sarah** 

"What are you doing?" Josh's voice cut through the air. 
I strained to listen more closely, climbing onto the toilet to catch the voices more clearly. Thankfully, my thoughts hadn't deceived me. The sound was faint, barely more than a whisper since I was eavesdropping from the bathroom, hoping to catch any helpful information. 
"Go away! I need to smoke to ease my stress, and it doesn't help seeing you here!" Megan's voice was sharp with irritation as she shouted at the bodyguard. 
"You know it's not Sarah Mitchell. Why are you accusing her of what happened at the villa?" Josh pressed. 
"I don't need your opinion! Why are you even on Philip's team, huh? To mess with me?" Megan snapped back. 
"Yes, that's right! You'll see me every day, Megan," Josh's voice trembled with intensity. "This is what you've brought upon me and my family." His anger was palpable 
"Let go of me, you jerk!" Megan's voice rose in fury. 
"And you are the most despicable person I've ever met! You're a cunt!" Josh's voice was filled with rage, starkly contrasting with his usual calm demeanor when he talked to me. 
I heard the sharp sound of a slap. Megan had probably slapped Josh. 
"You want me back; that's why you're bothering me!" Megan accused. 
Josh growled, his breath heavy with frustration. "No, Megan. I want to know the truth! I've been with Mr. Cornell's team for half a year. I've heard the rumors. You were supposed to marry Mr. Cornell. Why did you leave him for me? And now, you're running back to him even though you know he doesn't want you because Ms. Mitchell is there!" 
"Ah, that woman doesn't even faze me! Philip and Sarah reconciling? Impossible. Madam Cornell would never permit it." 
Josh chuckled. "Ah, trying to curry favor with Madam Cornell, are we? Yet you're clueless about her intentions. Funny, really. You and she? Cut from the same cloth. Maybe both of you could benefit from a little therapy!" 
"You're a piece of shit!" Megan shot back. "Daniel, why don't we join forces to sort this out? You want me back, right? I might entertain the idea if you guarantee Sarah's demise." 
My focus intensified upon hearing Megan's words. While I couldn't decipher Josh's thoughts, one thing was clear: his relationship with Megan was far from healthy. Moreover, I suspect Megan was unaware prior to this day that Josh or Daniel she mentioned is a part of Philip's team. 
Daniel... Daniel who? 
I can only hope Jakob has already gathered information about Josh. 
*** 
My mind wandered as I sat in the back of Philip's car. Megan and I were with him after the fire investigation and on our way to Luminary Productions. Even though I've finally received an answer about Megan and Josh's relationship status, I still feel unsettled. People tend to betray me. 
Megan occupied the front passenger seat while Philip and I were in the back. Much to my relief, he was engrossed in his laptop, as it meant he wouldn't be clingy. 
"Philip, remember the event I told you about? It's Langston's anniversary. Alex already confirmed our attendance," Megan reminded him. 
I chose to gaze out the window, pretending not to hear her. I knew she had said it deliberately, rubbing in my face that no matter what, she and Philip shared a connection that excluded me. 
"Oh, right! I'll bring Sarah on your behalf," Philip commented. 
"What?" Megan raised her voice and glanced at me through the rearview mirror. 
"Megan, your home just burned down. It wouldn't be right for people to see you partying at the event as if nothing happened. They will definitely question your presence there. Wouldn't it be better if they believed you were preoccupied with what happened at your residence?" Philip explained. 
I could see Megan's face sour. She was clearly dismayed, but Philip made sense. Unfortunately, Bronn had already invited me to the event because Langston is a major sponsor of theirs. The event would take place in the neighboring city of Highland Hills, and since Bronn knew I was in the town, he had already informed me. 
"I'm afraid I can't make other arrangements, Philip. Mr. Bronn Martin has already extended the invitation, and I'll be attending as a representative of BM Technologies, accompanying him." 
Philip's jaw tightened, his gaze fixing upon me with an intensity that made my heart beat. "We'll discuss this later."  
Megan explained, her voice tense, "Philip, the Langstons are expecting us." Her determined demeanor suggested she was unwilling to let me accompany my ex-husband to the party. 
"Megan, if you're so keen on going, why don't you take Mr. Martin as your date?" Philip retorted. 
Megan averted her gaze. Philip's words cut deeper than any blade. Her eyes smoldered with a potent mix of anguish and fury as she turned her withering glare upon me, clearly holding me accountable for his cruelty.  
I interjected, "Philip, you know I'm here on behalf of Bronn's company." 
"Bronn? I didn't realize your association with him was that intimate." Philip closed his laptop with an annoyed expression. 
I shook my head in exasperation. This was simply about attending the Langston party. Why do I feel like I've cheated? This jealous behavior-I don't have time for his sulking! I'm here for business.  
When the car stopped, Megan looked on the verge of tears as she swiftly exited and walked away. I gathered my things, paying her no further attention.   
"Why are you giving me away to Megan?" Philip asked, regaining my focus. 
"Philip, you're a person, not something to be 'given' to someone," I clarified. Here we go again. This brute never could resist an opportunity to start his constant banter and childish taunting.  
"About the party? Why do you want me to take Megan?"   
"I didn't suggest that you bring Megan. What I meant is that I already committed to attending with Bronn. I'm here representing BM Technologies, remember? It's normal for colleagues to be at the same event, just like you and Megan." 
"I won't approve of you going with Bronn." 
I huffed. "I'm not asking for your permission. If you don't want to take Megan, take Madam Cornell or Jane! Listen, you're giving me a headache, Philip. I'm just reminding you that I finished defending myself in the interview earlier with the investigators. You're giving me SDE vibes."  
"SDE?" He gave me a confused look. 
"Small dick energy," I replied. 
The driver opened his mouth wide, widening his eyes. I wasn't even aware that he was still in the vehicle. 
"What does that even mean? You're fully aware I'm big and have a lot of energy!" Philip exclaimed. 
"I'm not in the mood to talk about your dick!" With heated cheeks, I rolled my eyes, trying to play it cool. 
But the driver picked up on that second-hand embarrassment vibe and wanted to fade into the upholstery to avoid further bruising his boss's ego. 
"You brought that up, and now you're not in the mood? I really don't understand you." 
"Sure, sure. Let's be honest; that's the reason for our divorce!" 
The driver's eyes widened in utter shock. Philip also commented. "You divorced me because I have a small dick?" 
The driver awkwardly exited the car.  
I had the strong urge to throttle Philip! "Seriously! I don't want to talk about your dick! What I meant is that we simply don't understand each other, which led to our divorce! Got that? Furthermore, I wouldn't approve of going with you either." 
"Huh? Why's that?" he asked. 
"Because it'll look like I'm replacing Megan again. My ego can't handle that." My cheeks flushed as soon as the words left my mouth. 
It stopped Philip from bantering, finally getting my point. 
I got out of the car, determined not to let my headache worsen because of him. The driver scratched his head awkwardly. My banter with Philip will surely linger even in his dreams! That rascal! It's his fault for not grasping my words properly. 
As I walked, I ran into Alex. 
"Alex, where can I work?" I asked, looking for a suitable office space. 
"Uh, where would you like to have an office, Madam Sarah?" 
I'd choose Philip's office if I wanted to irritate Madam Cornell and Megan. But I wanted to avoid seeing Philip as I worked, especially since Jakob and I were working on something he shouldn't see or know about. 
"Somewhere far from your boss, somewhere I won't even see his shadow-does such a place exist?" I asked.  
He cleared his throat. "The chairman's office?" He meant Philip's father. 
I blinked, momentarily thrown off guard. "I'm just kidding! Just give me a space near the production team I'll work with." 
As Alex led me to the new office space, my phone buzzed with a message from Jakob. 
***Jakob:*** *Josh's real name is Dr. Daniel Caldwell, and his history with Megan is more complicated than we thought.*
###chapter 62: Price of Wealth 
**Sarah**  
Reading Jakob's message, I carefully calculated my next steps. Approaching Josh directly about the information we had gathered wasn't an option.  
I replied: One thing I'm certain about him-he loved Megan, which is why he's seeking answers. And when people love someone, they can do reckless things.  
Jakob: Agreed.    
I still needed to figure out if I could trust Josh. Jakob and I need to watch his actions closely. Megan will do whatever it takes, and given their past relationship, it will be easier for her to gain Josh's trust.  
Me: We must launch LoveLogic.  
Jakob: That's why we're putting in the effort, doll. Now, we need backing from BM's major sponsors. I need to secure some software and security tools. By the way, are you attending the Langston event because of Madam Cornell's connection with them?  
Bronn probably informed him about it.  
Me: Yes. Also, I want to meet the Langstons to try to get their support. According to Bronn, Langston is one of the major sponsors that will approve LoveLogic if we're ready for the market and if it's projected to be profitable.    
The relationship between the Langston couple and the Cornells is significant. I wouldn't be surprised if my former in-laws made an appearance. From what I've heard, the Langstons played a key role in Philip deciding to marry me.  
I slipped my phone back into my pocket and followed Alex. As we entered one office space, I noticed Jane was already there, diligently gathering details.  
"Everyone, this is Ms. Mitchell. She's a representative from BM Technology and will be working with the editorial team," Alex explained. "I'll leave you now, Mad- Ms. Mitchell," he said, quickly correcting himself from nearly calling me "Madam."  
Philip and I agreed that I would be known only as Ms. Mitchell. It wouldn't reflect well on his image if his ex-wife were working as a secretary for an outsourcing company. I also wanted to avoid drawing attention to our past relationship, so we reached a mutual understanding.  
"Thanks, Alex!"  
"Just let me know if there's any issue," Alex said before leaving the room.  
While I was setting up my laptop, three people approached me. "Hello, Ms. Mitchell. Can we call you Sarah?"  
"Sure!" I replied.  
"We are part of the editorial team at Luminary Productions..." They then shared how their team operates before asking about my background.   
"We were told you and Ms. Jane Cornell were college classmates," one of them said.  
"Ah, yes. That's how we know each other," I glanced at Jane, who was busy working while conversing with her team.  
"If so, did you use that connection to become the representative for BM Technologies?" another asked suspiciously.    
Another chimed in, "Yeah, I'm wondering why BM would send just a secretary to represent them. Sending just anyone is like an insult to Luminary Production."  
Their comments caught me off guard.   
"Hmm...my cousin works at BM Technology, and he's heard rumors about you being close to Mr. Martin. Do you have some elicit relationship with BM's chairman that got you this role?"  
I didn't appreciate their insinuating tone one bit.  
"Is that how you can afford those fancy designer bags?" the third person commented. 
I fell into silence, uncertain of their intentions. Then I chuckled, "Wow, is that how you all operate? I bought this bag with my savings." I eyed the expensive diamond necklace on one woman. "How lovely, a lab-grown diamond! Did you have to sell yourself to afford such an exquisite necklace worth fifty grand?"  
"You-!" The woman's teeth clenched. "I paid for this myself!"  
"Well, then, what's the difference in how I paid for my bag?" I asked, my eyes narrowing.  
"Because you're just a secretary! An orphan!" she spat.  
I raised an eyebrow, but her colleague intervened before it could escalate further. "S-Sarah, let's not exchange harsh words. We're just trying to get to know you."  
"You're the ones being disrespectful," I countered.  
"We just don't want you meddling in the editing. That's all!" her colleague insisted.  
My gaze narrowed, realization dawning that this was all about ego. Sensing the tension, Jane stepped closer. "Is everything alright?"  
"Nothing, Ms. Cornell. Just discussing work and getting acquainted with Ms. Mitchell. Though it seems she dislikes us."  
Jane smiled politely. "Well, our meeting is coming up, so be prepared in case Boss Philip asks you anything."    
The fools then returned to their workstations, the woman with the necklace rudely brushing past me.  
"Sorry about their attitude," Jane apologized once they were gone.  
I shrugged. It was clear to me that their kindness towards her stemmed solely from the recognition of Jane as the chairman's daughter, regardless of her lineage. After all, she remained a beneficiary of her father's fortune, a fact that couldn't be overlooked despite its origin.  
Jane leaned in, "Anyway, how are things with you and Brother Philip?"  
"What do you mean?" I asked, typing my long password on my laptop.  
"Will you two get back together? I can tell you still like each other. If not, why did you have an intimate time yesterday at the spa, or salon, and Philip slept over at the villa?"  
I rolled my eyes in exasperation, and Jane caught the same nuance that Jakob did. "Love, reconciling with Philip in that manner is simply not feasible for me. Things have gotten more laid-back between us, and I'm mainly here to focus on my job. Besides, you're aware that what transpired in the past was far from simple."  
A fierce desire to retaliate against Madam Cornell burns within me like an unrelenting fire. The situation will only get worse if Philip is in the picture.  
"Then why do you two still refer to each other as 'my wife' or 'my husband'?" Jane inquired once more.  
"We do?" came my puzzled response.  
She nodded. "Sometimes you forget Philip is your ex-husband. I often hear you say, 'My husband'. The same goes for my brother."  
Hmm... I was surprised to find out they picked up on that. It's Jakob's habit of frequently referring to Philip as 'your husband' that's to blame. That's right! It was all his doing!  
"And let's face it, deep down, you yearn for reconciliation," Jane interjected.  
"But if I'm to pursue genuine happiness, I must choose a different path," I replied softly, almost in a whisper.  
"Someone like Mr. Amir Benner, perhaps? What exactly is the nature of your relationship with him?" Jane inquired.  
Jane doesn't really know my true self. She can't find out either because it's dangerous, especially if Marcus finds me.  
"I want to clarify that there is no romantic involvement between Mr. Amir Benner and myself. Please disregard any claims made by Philip regarding our relationship."   
Jane nodded in understanding, then inquired further, "And what about your relationship with your boss at BM?"   
I replied calmly, "Bronn? He's actually a childhood friend of mine."  
'I'm really sorry for lying, Jane.'  
"Is he courting you?" she asked in a confused tone.  
That's the undeniable truth, and so I nodded in agreement.  
"If so, then Brother Philip has a tough rival," she murmured.  
"Forget about that brute," I casually commented, rolling my eyes.   
Jane chuckled.   
When my six-month contract at Highland Hills concluded, I planned to return to Henderson. However, there was a possibility I would remain in Dubai if the LoveLogic project launched by then, ensuring Madam Cornell lost her position as the chairman's wife.  
My deepest desire was to become a mother and housewife, enjoying a healthy, non-toxic relationship with my husband and in-laws. Bronn was the sole individual capable of providing me with that life because I have a good relationship with him and with his family.   
"Anyway, let's just continue working."  
Just before the meeting commenced, I received a call from the front desk informing me of a visitor waiting in the lobby. To my surprise, it turned out to be Philip's former pregnant secretary.  
'Hmm... this is fun.'  
I really thought she was out of the picture.
###chapter 63: Tangled of Schemes 
**Sarah** 
The secretary who used to work for Philip met me with a defiant look as I approached her in the lobby. Back then, I thought Philip had betrayed me and disrespected our marriage. Now I realize this woman dealt a huge blow to my self-worth. 
However, where was Philip when the secretary was having sex with his uncle or whoever it was? And why did she choose my ex-husband's office for their sordid affair? Why was I so foolish to allow these people to oppress me? 
What was her name again? 
"What do you need from me?" I asked, masking my emotions. 
She raised an eyebrow, poised for confrontation. "Can I talk to you?" 
"What is this about?" I asked, looking innocent like a lost little girl facing the big bad wolf. 
"It's about Boss Philip." 
"The truth is I'm busy, but I'll give you five minutes if it's brief," I said. 
She stared at me intently, likely scrutinizing my reactions. I knew she suspected I would soon be working at Luminary Productions, and I didn't want her interference. It was best to sever any lingering ties with her. 
I invited the woman to LM Garden, the very place where I discovered her affair with Philip's uncle-the true father of her unborn child. I made her sit on the bench while I stood before her, a deliberate stance of authority. 
"Tell me what you want," I demanded, my voice cold and unyielding. 
"I need financial support," she replied.  
"And why is that?" I asked, though I already knew the answer. 
"I-I'm pregnant," she stuttered, her gaze dropping to her round belly. 
"I can see that," I said dryly. Her condition was obvious to anyone with eyes. 
"You must help me," she insisted. 
Feigning surprised, I raised an eyebrow. "Miss, as far as I know, I'm also a woman. Do I look like the one who got you pregnant?" 
Her anger flared, and she stood abruptly. "You know what I mean. Boss Philip refuses to talk to me, and I need financial support for our child!" 
I maintained my composure, though her audacity was beyond belief. If I had heard this before, it might have pierced my heart and left me reeling. 
"You must be aware that Philip and I are divorced. Why are you approaching me?" I asked. 
"Because you must help me! Surely, you received alimony!" 
I had received no alimony, no financial support, no compensation for the heartbreak that Philip had caused. What I had wanted was freedom from our bond, to mourn the loss of my baby without his shadow looming over me. 
I closed my eyes tightly, remembering my child. The pain lingered like a dager in my heart. I truly hadn't moved on yet. 
The woman probably misinterpreted my silence, thinking I was affected by her affair with Philip. 
"I've met entitled people in my life, but I must say, you are the worst," I said, looking at her with venom.  
Her eyes widened in shock. "You-!" 
"Whether I received alimony from Philip or not, why would I help you?" I asked, confusion evident on my face. She was making no sense, almost as if she wanted to bewilder me. 
"Because your husband impregnated me!" she snarled. 
"I did not!" a voice interjected. 
I was startled to see Philip entering the garden area. The secretary stepped back, eyes widening as she saw Philip flanked by five security guards. 
"B-boss..." 
"Get that woman!" Philip ordered. Two guards restrained the pregnant woman by her arms while the others remained alert. 
"Send her to jail for trying to extort money from Sarah!" 
The former secretary panicked. "Ms. Mitchell, believe me. Boss Philip and I had a relationship! You saw it! You saw it that day!" 
I forced myself to remain emotionless, knowing I needed to stay calm for my mental well-being. 
Philip darkened his gaze at the woman. His eyes seemed almost red with anger after her words. Growling, he asked, "What do you mean Sarah saw something? What evidence?" 
"I made sure she saw what we left at your office. You saw it!" the woman insisted. 
It's pointless to revisit the past, whether true or not. The undeniable truth remains: Philip and I are destined to part ways because he doesn't love me. 
"You're stupid!" I told the woman firmly. "Don't you realize this is precisely what Philip's uncle intended? He desired for you to be trapped in this situation. You fell for his manipulation, didn't you?" 
The woman's expression shifted, clearly caught off guard by my insight into her connection with Philip's uncle. 
"Tell me. Who ordered you to ruin my relationship with Philip? Who gave you those orders?" 
"No one!" she replied. "Boss Philip and I have a relationship! Believe me!" Fear flickered in her eyes. 
"I'll offer you a hundred thousand. Is that enough? I want to know the truth!" I said. 
Her eyes flickered at the mention of money, clearly tempted. 
"What about three hundred thousand?" I proposed. "All I require is a name." 
"It's Madam Cornell!" she blurted out, visibly trembling. "S-she's the one!" 
Philip's demeanor stiffened at the revelation. 
"S-she spotted me with the president's uncle in a hotel lobby before you visited the office. She instructed me to fabricate a relationship with Boss Philip to sow discord. Because I was with Boss's political rival, she knew I was a spy within Boss Philip's team. She threatened me, forcing me to comply.  
"With the president engrossed in his own matters that day, I saw an opportunity. Now, I seek only the money! I won't bother you again, but I need it! I don't want to involve your family anymore!" the secretary explained.  
"Give her the money," I instructed Philip, leaving him speechless. 
*** 
**Philip** 
I looked for Sarah because it was almost time for our meeting, but Jane informed me that my ex-wife had a visitor. Curiosity piqued, I went to see who the visitor was. It turned out to be my pregnant former secretary.  
The anger that had consumed me dissolved at the sound of Sarah's final words. My mouth fell open, rendered nearly speechless by the nonsensical nature of her explanation.  
"Why should I be the one footing the bill for $300,000? Weren't you the one who promised her payment?"  
"Firstly, you know I won't pay her the money! Secondly, she was your secretary. Thirdly, Madam Cornell is your mother! And lastly, dealing with this whole situation is your doing!" Sarah retorted. 
Why am I being blamed for this? 
This woman! Her logic seemed to defy all reason. I never imagined being stripped of a $300,000 lighter simply by walking into this garden.  
Defeated, I reached for my phone and dialed Alex, instructing him to settle the secretary's payment and pursue legal action to ensure she never troubled Sarah again. 
Sighing, I whispered to Sarah, "I'm sorry," drawing closer to touch her cheek gently. "I'm sorry for my mother's scheme." 
I closed my eyes tightly, realizing I must finally face my mother, whom I've been trying to avoid for days.
###chapter 64: Mother's Machinations 
**Philip** 

After the meeting, I was taken aback to find my mother waiting for me. I initially thought she was scheming to stir up trouble for Sarah again. However, her words took me by surprise. 
"Son, are you busy? I wanted to invite you to have dinner," Mother stated.  
"I'm always busy, Mother," I muttered as I reviewed one document. "But I'm fine with dinner tonight." 
I had my reasons for wanting to talk to her, so I agreed to accompany her. Some matters needed to be clarified, secrets that had come to light, especially concerning Sarah and her involvement. She needed to know what I had discovered. 
"Don't neglect yourself. You've been so preoccupied that we don't get to talk properly. We don't see each other anymore. You're often on trips, and I have also heard Sarah is staying at Mr. Benner's villa." 
I remained silent in the presence of my mother. At that moment, delving into a conversation was not on my agenda. My focus was tethered to my work, and I had no intention of allowing anything to disturb that precarious balance. 
"Philip, I talked with the Langston couple. They will support you if you challenge your dad for the chairman position." 
I frowned. 
"Mom, maybe you understand that it's only been a year since I took over as president, which almost wouldn't happen if Uncle hadn't cheated in his job." 
"Philip, I'm doing this for your good!" she exclaimed. 
It seemed my mother probably thought she could still manipulate me like a schoolboy. My mood soured. The notion of enduring dinner and remaining in Mom's company until then was utterly intolerable; I'd rather exchange bickering with Sarah than subject myself to another moment with Mother. So, I enlisted Alex's help to secure a restaurant reservation. 
Across from Luminary Productions, we saw Jane and Sarah eating simple sandwiches at the convenience store. I met Sarah's eyes, but her gaze was locked on my mother, who squinted in their direction. 
Mom silently warred against Sarah, still seeing her as the vulnerable woman I'd married. But my Sarah had changed drastically in a year, which confused me, as I thought I'd hate that change. 
Megan's voice interrupted as Mom's car rumbled to a stop by the wide exit door. 
"Madam Cornell!" Megan called out, catching both my and my mother's attention. 
Mom's face lit up momentarily before she expressed concern, "Oh, dear! I heard your villa burned down. How's the investigation going?" 
Megan glanced in my direction before replying, "The investigation is ongoing. I'm thankful to Philip for graciously accommodating me at Serenity Pines Estate for the time being." She then turned to my mother with a warm smile.  
Mother muttered, "Just let me know if you need anything." 
I yearned for my mother to exhibit such kindness in Sarah's company. Yet, in light of her actions towards Sarah, it felt like a distant dream beyond the realm of possibility. 
With a heavy heart, I stole another glance at the convenience store, finding Sarah's gaze unyielding. 
"Madam Cornell, hearing about my helper's passing was truly heartbreaking," Megan replied softly. 
"Since you're staying with Philip, why not join us for dinner?" my mother insisted, placing a comforting hand on Megan's shoulder. 
"Mom, I'd prefer it if it were just the two of us for dinner tonight," I interjected. 
"Oh, Philip! Megan has been through so much already. She needs our support. Despite everything, she still attended your meeting and helped with your project," my mother urged. 
I hesitated, torn between wanting a private conversation with my mother and recognizing her point. The nurse's revelation about Megan visiting Sarah in the hospital last year added to my uncertainty. 
Megan's eyes pleaded with me, silently begging my understanding. "Please, Philip. I don't have anyone to share a meal with tonight, and knowing you're not there would only add to my sadness." 
"Don't worry about him, Megan. Come join us for dinner," my mother insisted. 
"Fine! Let's go," I agreed, trying to appear indifferent. 
"Really? Can I? Thank you, Philip and Madam Cornell! Your presence makes me feel like I have my mom back," Megan said, her voice catching with emotion. 
I led them to the van, where they could chat during the ride. And when I glanced back at Sarah, her chilling gesture-her thumb drawn across her throat-indicating a clear warning: 'You're dead!' 
This woman! What fresh hell has she conjured this time? What have I committed? I reached for my phone and fired off a message: See you later, babe! 
She had the nerve to ignore it.  
At the restaurant, I swirled my wine glass absentmindedly as Mom and Megan engaged in conversation. The atmosphere felt dull but suffocating, and an overwhelming urge to escape washed over me with each passing word. 
"Philip, seriously, when are you going to marry Megan? You're both available now. She's just waiting for you," Mom pressed.  
Crimson bloomed across Megan's cheeks in a shameful blush. 
"Mom, maybe you forgot, but Megan left and found someone else. We're not together anymore," I interjected casually. 
Megan nearly choked. "I thought you'd moved on from that, Philip." 
"And what of Sarah? Did she not betray you in equal measure by taking another lover?" Mom's relentless interrogation persisted. 
Suddenly, a voice from behind caught us off guard. "Tsk, tsk, Madam Cornell, I didn't expect you to discuss me when I'm not present. But please, don't compare me with Megan." 
I turned around to find Sarah standing there, a hint of mischief in her eyes. Jane trailed behind her, my sister's expression a silent declaration of innocence as if to say, 'I'm just along for the ride.' 
"Why are you two here?!" Megan snapped.  
"Jane and I were craving steak! But even from blocks away, the reek of, ahem, strong old folks, collagen-starved hags assaulted our nostrils. And then I heard my name being talked about. I figured it was this lovely bunch who love talking shit!" Sarah explained with a smirk. 
"You-! Philip, please ask that woman to leave," my mother demanded. 
"Madam, getting angrier won't smooth out those wrinkles. Relax, take it easy" Sarah retorted. "By the way, what's on the menu? I'm famished after that meeting." She turned to me expectantly. 
Wait, hadn't I seen her munching on a sandwich earlier? 
"I'm craving these scallops!" Sarah declared, popping one into her mouth without hesitation. 
"You really lack manners! Philip, do something!" My mother's voice rose, drawing attention from nearby diners. She was making a scene. 
"Or I shall simply take my leave of this terrible place!" My mother threatened. 
Sarah just smirked, seemingly unfazed by my mother's theatrics. At that moment, I had an overwhelming urge to seize those mocking lips with my own and put the insolent woman in her place. I shook my head to dispel the thought. 
"Philip, Sarah's behavior spoils our meal," Megan chimed in. 
"Whaaat? What have I done now? Megan, you've accused me several times already," Sarah shot back. 
My mother stood abruptly, tossing the napkin onto the table. "I've lost my appetite!" With that, she grabbed her purse and glanced at me. "If they want to stay, let's find another place!" 
She noticed my lack of movement. Would I be a neglectful son if I didn't escort her? 
"Madam Cornell," Sarah called out loudly, raising my wineglass mockingly as Mother began her dramatic exit. 
My mother turned to listen as Sarah continued speaking.  
"Philip's former secretary paid me a visit earlier, just so you're aware, and your name came up," Sarah said. 
My mother gritted her teeth, her gaze darkening as it fixed on me. "I'm taking action for your sake, Philip! That includes removing that woman from your life." 
I rose from my chair, unable to endure the weight in my chest any longer, the relentless question echoing unanswered within me. "What about the removal of my child, Mother? Is that for my sake or yours, because you favor Megan for me? Well, I refuse to entertain the notion any longer!" I snapped. 
Megan and my mother gasped in disbelief. I raised my voice, the frustration boiling over. "Did you ever stop to consider if I wanted any of the things you've done, Mother?" 
Mother's jaw clenched, her hands knotting into claws. "That woman is bad for you!" 
"You're acting out of self-interest, Madam! Karma's a bitch!" Sarah declared, a sly smile tugging at the corners of her lips. 
Mother could do nothing more than turn on her heel and storm from the restaurant. 
I couldn't shake the nagging feeling if I were truly safeguarding Sarah or if her facade merely blinded me. She carries herself with such poise, but perhaps it's all an illusion.
###chapter 65: Mending Fences 
**Sarah** 

My intuition proved accurate regarding Madam Cornell's behavior. She only displayed courage when she believed I wouldn't challenge her actions. However, upon realizing my willingness to confront her, she couldn't stand it and left. Her anger towards me intensified because she could no longer control Philip. 
I will uncover Madam Cornell's weakness. 
Megan remained seated, jaw clenched, struggling to regain her composure. Nevertheless, she tried to recover. 
"Philip, you don't truly love Sarah. Do you think if your baby with her were alive, you would have a happy life? Do you really believe it would help your position as the prospective president while she's pregnant? Your mother was right! One thing is certain about your relationship with Sarah while I was gone - you don't respect or love her. You despise her!" Megan declared, her voice steady but filled with contempt. She stood up, casting a furious glance in my direction. 
She was right. It was this realization that prompted me to seek a separation from Philip upon discovering my pregnancy. Without a second thought, I hurled the wine in Megan's direction, prompting a sharp gasp from her. 
"Ahhh! You-!" Her voice trembled with rage, her eyes welling with tears as the surrounding diners cast curious glances our way. 
Trying to suppress the tears that wanted to escape from my eyes, I said, "Maybe you're right, but that doesn't mean you have the right to take away my child's life from me."  
I matched Megan's anger. 
"I am the only one Philip truly loves!" she asserted before storming off to follow Madam Cornell. 
Philip's furrowed brows conveyed his disapproval, yet he remained silent. My chest constricted again; a familiar sensation accompanied by dizziness. 
"Sarah, are you alright?" Jane asked with concern. 
I focused on her wavering figure. "Let's head home," I managed, having lost my appetite. 
"Uhm," Jane faltered, her gaze shifting nervously to Philip, whose expression darkened further. My ex-husband couldn't refute Megan's words because she spoke a painful truth. 
"Aren't we going to finish the food?" Jane grimaced. 
"Would you like to stay?" I inquired. After Alex informed me that Philip and his mother were here, I invited Jane to follow the mother and son. Together, we rode in Philip's car, trailing Madam Cornell's van. 
Philip gave Jane a look, silently asking her to stay, likely thinking I would stay if she did. Jane sat and started serving herself food. 
"Th-they smell delicious!" she said, spooning food into her mouth. 
Turning to Philip, I directed, "You take Jane to the villa. I'm not feeling well." 
With determined strides, I marched towards the restaurant's exit. The threat of fainting loomed over me like a dark cloud, and I was no longer in the mood to face Philip.  
I heard him tell Jane, "Stay here for a while. I'll talk to her." 
"O-okay..." Jane replied. 
Before I could hail a taxi, Philip intercepted me, his grip firm on my arm as he whisked me into his waiting car. He instructed his bodyguard, "Take care of Jane for now. Take her to the villa when I signal you." 
My brow furrowed in silent protest, yet I lacked the energy to contest Philip's actions. Leaning back in the car seat, I closed my eyes, seeking refuge in the silence as Philip navigated through traffic with a sense of urgency. 
As we halted at the villa's entrance, Philip's words pierced the air. "Don't trust Megan's words." 
"That's the thing, I do trust her." I countered firmly, though frustration gnawed at my insides. Despite my resolve, I entered the villa, my mood heavy with discontent. Was it too much to ask for peace? 
Philip trailed behind me as we stepped into the opulent living room, his voice hesitant. "Sarah-" 
I interrupted, unwilling to entertain any more falsehoods. "Philip, Megan was right! Last year, when I was pregnant, the baby wasn't your priority-I wasn't your priority! If we could rewind to that moment, what action would you take? Will that change how you treat me? Will you finally love me?" 
His lips quivered, the weight of his guilt evident in his struggle to speak. It was as if he was wrestling with his conscience, searching for words to bridge the chasm between us. 
"No!" Tears brimmed in my eyes, the ache in my heart echoing in every syllable. "No, Philip! Because deep down, you suspected I was carrying another man's child! You thought I was sleeping with Amir! So don't lie to me!" 
"Sarah," his voice softened, tinged with remorse. "What can I do? I already regret it, don't I? I'll do anything for your forgiveness..." 
"But it's still not enough, Philip. My heart remains wounded, even now. Life is unfair, don't you think? Why am I the only one in pain? Why am I the only one grieving? Do you understand why I always wear black? I still mourn the loss of my child. The pain you caused me just won't let go..." Tears streamed down my face as the wounded words poured out, my voice thick with hurt and accusation. 
Philip drew nearer, enfolding me in his embrace, his heartbeat steady against my ear. "Sarah, I'm hurting too. Please, believe me... But what can I do? The investigations have revealed something different now." 
His touch on my back was soothing, easing the tension in my body, if only momentarily. Questions swirled in my mind. 'Philip, what does your apology really mean? What's the point if we can't find it ourselves to forgive each other? There may come a time when one of us will fail again, and we'll be back to where we started. We're like oil and water-never truly blending.' 
As I met his desperate gaze, his lips met mine. It was a gesture of understanding as if he could sense the depth of my pain. At that moment, all I craved was his touch, his warmth to envelop me, to escape the harsh reality momentarily. 
Our kiss deepened, a silent agreement passing between us. He lifted me effortlessly, carrying me towards the bedroom. With each step, the ache in my chest seemed to dissipate, replaced by the intimacy we shared. 
'Philip, what's the point of this? I'm not ready if your only intention is to hurt me again.' 
But in that fleeting moment, with the promise of a second chance, I chose to let go of my fears and allow my emotions to guide me. 
*** 
At the restaurant, Jane sat, growing increasingly impatient as she awaited Philip's message, as instructed by the guards. Three hours had passed, and she was still there, garnering curious glances from the servers as diners trickled out one by one. 
"Are you absolutely certain Brother Philip instructed me to stay?" Jane inquired, frustration evident in her tone. 
The guard scratched his head. "That's what the boss said. He'll signal once things are sorted with Madam Sarah, and then we'll escort you to the villa." 
Jane felt exasperated. How much longer would she have to wait? 
"I've had enough!" She rose from her seat, ready to leave, but was halted by the manager. 
"Excuse me, ma'am. Where do you think you're going?" the restaurant manager asked. 
"Um, I'm heading home," Jane replied, bewildered by the interruption. 
"This table hasn't settled its bill. You'll need to pay before you leave." 
Jane's jaw dropped in disbelief, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "W-what do you mean? Madam Cornell or my brother hasn't settled the bill yet?" 
"Exactly that." The restaurant manager replied. 
Jane fought back tears at the sudden predicament.  
'How did this become my responsibility?' she lamented silently. She had only accompanied Sarah for company, yet now she found herself left behind to foot the bill after her family had departed one by one. 
"Ugh, that couple! They always give me a headache! Seriously! I should've just gone home and called it a night!" 
She retrieved her credit card and handed it over to the manager. 
Those two troublemakers were probably already fast asleep!
###chapter 66: Unchosen Duty 
**Sarah** 

Heat exploded across my body, coursing down my chest to pool between my thighs. My pulse thundered wildly, my legs shaking as they squeezed together with an achy need for Philip. 
"What do you want me to do, Sarah?" Philip gently laid me on the bed before towering over me. His fingers threaded through my hair, holding me with a tender yet firm grip, as if he was determined to remain entwined with me, no matter my protests. 
Under different circumstances, I might have wanted him to leave me alone, but now I was wet, burning, craving him desperately. 
My heart yearned for his love, even if it seemed impossible. 
His mouth crashed onto mine with searing passion. My legs snaked around his firm backside as I responded fervently to his damning kisses. After I nearly lost my breath from the intensity, his mouth trailed down to devour the sensitive skin of my neck. I could feel the throbbing need in my core pulsating with each passing moment, my body curling with pleasure against the soft bed. 
"Damn! What are you doing to me, Sarah?" Philip groaned, breathing in my scent deeply. 
I wondered the same question.  
He ground his body against mine, ensuring I could feel his own aching need. "Feel that? This isn't a lie, babe. I ache for you. My cock throbs for you." 
I descended into delirium, my eyes fluttering closed as I slowly drew in ragged breaths, savoring the exquisite feeling despite the barrier of our clothes. 
He flipped me onto the bed, then murmured huskily, "I must take you." 
My core shuddered at his promising words. Two strong palms caressed my legs, trailing upwards with deliberate slowness. His fingers teasingly hooked into my garter belt before rolling my panties down my thighs. 
"Do you think we should skip right to the main course?" he muttered. 
His hand roamed over my butt, firmly kneading my firm cheeks. "Don't respond. This wasn't lying." 
My eyes widened as his fingers traced along my slippery, intimate flesh. 
"Philip!" 
I let out a gasp as he sank his teeth into my buttocks. His powerful hands gripped me, lewdly spreading me open as I felt his hot breath against my skin. 
My face contorted in pleasure, eyes rolling back as his mouth descended between my thighs, covering me with his warmth. His tongue moved slowly, deliberately, through my most intimate lips, eliciting a squeal into the sheets and curling my toes in sheer delight. 
"God!" 
I cried out again as his tongue pushed inside, delving deeply as if he were devouring my very soul. Wave after wave of pure bliss washed over me. My fingers clutched the bed linens as I gasped for air, completely lost in the pleasure. 
His tongue moved lower, swirling around my aching, needy clit. He wrapped his lips around the throbbing nub, sucking on it until my legs shook. My eyes squeezed shut, my brow furrowing as I moaned into delirium. 
The heat between my legs grew more intense, throbbing with an insistent need. His tongue dragged across my pulsing clit, making my vision blur and my senses reel. 
Gradually, his tongue descended, then retreated, going even further. His hands gripped tighter, widening my wetness as his tongue delved deeper into exploration. The sensation was so incredibly intense that I felt an urge to scream with pleasure. 
"You belong to me, Sarah. No matter how many times you deny it, no matter how your heart struggles to forgive, deep down, you know you're mine." 
Belonging to someone is one thing, but resenting the circumstances is another-and that is our tragedy. 
I soon heard the distinct sound of his zipper and belt, hurriedly removed as if time were of the essence. He paid no heed to whether his top remained on or not. 
My anticipation surged as I realized he was on the verge of taking me at any moment. In a heartbeat, the slick heat of my pussy met the immense, swollen head of his cock, aligning perfectly with my entrance. 
"Shiit!" I gasped, my voice muffled by the sheets as if seeking solace in their embrace against the overwhelming intensity of Philip's thrusts. 
Philip relentlessly drove me towards unparalleled ecstasy as I moaned loudly. His hand tangled in my hair, strands dampened with tiny beads of sweat trailing down my neck.  
As he relentlessly plunged into me, his pulsating shaft teased every nerve ending, his fervent gasps harmonizing with my fervent moans. I clenched around him, enveloping him in a vice grip as he delved deeper, every inch forging a connection that transcended mere physicality. 
Moments passed before I felt the warm rush of his release, his essence mingling with mine in a primal dance of passion. The sensation left me breathless, questioning the inexplicable allure of his touch as he remained within me, our bodies still intertwined. 
God, why did it feel so good?  
Philip's tender kisses trailed along my back, a gentle reassurance of our connection. We shifted positions on the bed, my back still to him. His arm secured my waist while his fingers teased my nipple, igniting a fire that still burned within us both. 
Still hard, he delved into me once more, his body molding against mine as he resumed his rhythmic thrusts. His lips traced along my skin before tilting my chin to meet his gaze. 
His eyes bore into mine as he continued to penetrate deeper. 
"I'm a man, Sarah. No matter what this may be between us, I promise to do everything to ensure our happiness above all else." 
Our lips locked the promise. 
*** 
When morning came, I woke up feeling the aftermath of Philip's relentless demands, my body aching all over.  
"Augh, God!" I groaned, sitting up in bed. Philip's note lay on the bedside table, and I picked it up, bracing myself for its contents. 
'I let you catch some more sleep, babe. Early meeting with Dad. See you soon!' 
How on earth does he still have energy after last night? Regardless, I prepared myself for the day ahead and headed to the office. 
Trey informed me that Philip was with Jane when I sought out my friend. I assumed it was some sort of family affair. 
Arriving at the office well past noon, I was met with a sour mood from the head editor. "Good heavens, our company is outsourcing BM, is it not? Surely, it's customary to arrive early. You've merely begun working here, yet you're already tardy on your second day."  
I winced, knowing he had every right to reprimand me. He did have a point. 
"Did you encounter any troubles with the tool?" I inquired. 
"Not thus far. It's straightforward to navigate. But we still expect your presence in the office should any issues arise," he replied, then added, "Anyhow, my team shall convene for a get-together this afternoon. Please, join us." 
My body still ached, prompting me to decline. "I must apologize. I have numerous tasks that require my attention. As you know, I'm Mr. Jakob's secretary; my focus is elsewhere." 
He frowned, creasing his brow. "But are you not the representative of BM technologies for the tool we're utilizing?" 
"Yes, that's correct," I replied casually. 
"Then you should attend. Our team has already computed the bill; your name's on it." 
Ah, so that explained his insistence; getting me to share the expenses. 
"My primary role here is to ensure that ChronoGrafix integrates smoothly with your operations. I still have obligations outside this project, excluding me from attending." 
With much work looming at LoveLogic, my decision was justified as I neared the design phase of the NPC inspired by Bronn, a task requiring my utmost attention. 
"I'm occupied, so if you could kindly leave me be," I declared firmly before he could continue with his antics. 
As I fixed my laptop and other items, I noticed Jane's somber demeanor; her red eyes betrayed recent tears. 
'Did I miss something?' I pondered internally, feeling a pang of guilt for leaving her after inviting her to follow Madam Cornell the previous night.  
I sent her a chat message instead of approaching her directly. Given my recent arrival at the office, I braced myself for a possible reprimand from the editor. 
***Me:*** *Is everything alright? Sorry for leaving you last night at the restaurant.* 
Jane glanced up, silently gesturing for me to join her outside. Sensing her distress, I followed her to the women's restroom. 
"Are you alright, loves?" I asked. 
Her tears streamed down. "Dad wants me to marry Mr. Olsen, Sarah. And Brother Philip agreed. No one in the family supports me." 
"Awww" I embraced her, offering what comfort I could. 
"My wedding is planned for this weekend; that's why I'm so distraught. I don't know what to do." 
After talking to Jane, I went to my ex-husband's office because I didn't know why Philip supported the marriage. 
"Where is Philip?" I asked Alex, who was guarding the door like a post. 
"Madam Sarah, he's inside speaking with Madam Olsen and Madam Cornell," he replied, almost stuttering. 
"Is the meeting about Jane's wedding?" I probed further. 
Alex met my gaze, uncertain whether to confirm or deny my suspicions.  
Madam Cornell's desire to torment Jane was clear to me. 
The door opened, and three pairs of eyes locked onto mine. Philip's expression betrayed his surprise at my unexpected presence, while Madam Cornell's narrowed eyes hinted at her ulterior motives. However, it was Mrs. Olsen's unexpected presence that truly shocked me. 
Time seemed to stand still as I stood rooted to the spot, grappling with the realization that the woman before me, Mrs. Olsen, bore an uncanny resemblance to someone I never expected to encounter in such a context. 
'Mom?' I froze, feeling ill as I stared at Madam Olsen. A wave of disbelief and nausea washed over me. 
How could this be? My mother had already passed away!
###chapter 67: Financial Fidelity 
**Philip**  
Dawn had scarcely broken when a call from Father roused me. Jane and I were summoned to the mansion, and we couldn't refuse. Reluctantly, I decided to bring my sister home, even though I didn't want to leave Sarah yet. At the Cornell mansion, my father's orders must be followed.  
Our family discussion over breakfast revolved around one pivotal issue: Jane's arranged marriage to the Olsens. In return, they would provide substantial support for our Sci-Fi project. Mom explained that the Olsen Group would invest 1.2 billion dollars into the project.  
Jane felt I didn't care about her, but that couldn't be further from the truth. I asked Mom if I could speak with the Olsens to ensure our agreement was solidified in a contract.  
"Brother Philip, why did you agree?" Jane cried as we drove to the office. "I expected you to fight for me. Now, you're even going to talk to the Olsens to secure my situation with them?"  
"Jane, I'm doing this for you! You know how Dad is; his decisions are final, and I can't change his mind."  
"No! You're doing this for your project, Brother Philip!" Her eyes were filled with tears.  
I frowned. While it was true I would benefit, I would also make sure Jane wasn't at a disadvantage with the Olsens.  
"Jane, you've wanted to leave home, haven't you? I've looked into the man you'll marry. He's a good person." I tried to comfort her, placing a hand on her shoulder, but she shrugged me off, her mind set against it.  
"Not like this, Brother. Do you want my marriage to end up like your relationship with Sarah? I don't know these people! I don't trust your mother, either!"  
Exasperated, I fell silent, brooding until we reached the office.  
At noon, while I was immersed in reviewing documents, Mom arrived with Madam Olsen. It was my first time meeting her, and her resemblance to Sarah struck me. They shared the same gray eyes and the same eyebrow shape. Madam Olsen had been living in Germany for years, which explained why I hadn't met her before.  
"Madam, do you have any distant relatives in Las Vegas?" I blurted out, unable to contain my curiosity. The possibility that she might be related to Sarah was something I couldn't ignore.  
"Philip, you're being rude," my mother said sharply, her eyes narrowing disapprovingly.  
"My apologies, madam," I said, turning to the regal woman across the table. "It's just that you bear an uncanny resemblance to my ex-wife," I apologized to the lady.  
Madam Olsen's expression remained nonchalant. "While my son is busy with his financial business in New York, your mother and I are attending a charity event here in town. This weekend, my family will be coming, and you'll have the chance to meet them. But to get to the point, what exactly do you want for the union? I haven't met Jane, but I've heard a lot about her. She's a scholar in London, young, beautiful, and seemingly perfect for the Olsens."  
She continued talking, echoing the sentiments familiar to families like ours. The painful truth is that being born into a wealthy family comes with strings attached. Mothers like Madam Olsen and my own see it as their duty to position their children advantageously, ensuring the family gains in business or political standing.  
My mother, in particular, is keen on solidifying her status as Madam Cornell. Ordinary people might not understand, but such a title opens many doors. They control the family while their husbands control the business, effectively giving them influence over everything.  
"For Jane, I would ask a yearly allowance of thirty percent from her husband's income," I began carefully. "Additionally, full ownership of David Olsen's property holdings in Germany as well as his commercial buildings in New York. In case of a divorce, Jane shall receive fifty percent of all assets in a settlement," I explained.  
The corners of Madam Olsen's lips turned up slightly. "50% is absurd! I would say 20% is more reasonable."  
The figure was not inconsiderable. 20% of David Olsen's net worth was still significant, so I agreed. Jane has some assets, but they're nothing compared to her future husband's wealth since she just graduated from college.  
"Upon marrying my son, Jane shall take up residence with us in New York. Her primary responsibilities will be tending to the household and caring for my grandchildren." She arched an imperious brow as she declared. "As you know, David has two children from his late wife. Jane will assume the duties of their stepmother and caretaker within our family estate."  
The conversation continued on various topics until my mother and Madam Olsen finally said their goodbyes. As we opened the door to my office, I saw Sarah waiting there, and the stress I'd felt all morning began to lift.  
However, her expression was one of anger.  
***  
**Sarah**  
In the luxurious office suite of my ex-husband, tension crackled like static electricity as Madam Cornell confronted Alex. "What brings her here? You're Philip's assistant, but it seems you were letting anyone in to see him."   
Her tone dripped with disapproval, clearly aimed at scolding Philip's assistant.  
Caught in the tension, I stood frozen, pondering my next move. Madam Olsen fixed her gaze on me, her expression sharp.  
"But frankly, this woman's lack of manners is just unbelievable, Madam Cornell. Who is she?" the woman demanded, her words hitting the air like daggers.  
"I couldn't agree more. Her lack of manners is precisely why I can't stand her," Madam Cornell retorted.  
"Madam, Mother, let's refrain from derogatory remarks about my ex-wife," Philip interjected sternly.  
"Your ex-wife?" Madam Olsen's eyebrow arched. "So she's the one you said resembles me. Good thing I see her personally because she looks nothing like me. I thought Megan Thompson was your ex you were trying to please." Her tone dripped with sarcasm, aimed squarely at me.  
I bristled at her words, my gaze narrowing.  
"Please disregard her, Madam Olsen. She's a woman from the slums! She can't accept that my son divorced her and won't leave him be since she gets no alimony. She's just trying to seduce Philip for money." Madam Cornell declared, turning her attention to me. "Leave at once!"  
Though my heart seethed with an unspoken fury, my words escaped me like sand through clenched fists. I remained wordless, my insides ablaze with a bewildering intensity. Despite Madam Olsen's striking resemblance, my mother had passed away years ago.   
"I'm here to discuss a matter concerning my job with Philip, not to entertain the baseless accusations you've leveled, Madam Cornell," I finally managed to say, extending my hand to Madam Olsen. "I'm Sarah Mitchell, an orphan and Philip's former wife."  
As I said my name, Madam Olsen's eyelids fluttered slightly, just as I had anticipated. A shiver ran through me as I studied her reaction. Madam Olsen's expression hardened, the flicker of recognition swiftly masked. Her gaze dropped to my outstretched hand, lips pressed into a thin line.  
"I've already sanitized my hands," she remarked coolly.  
Madam Cornell's lips curled into a smug smile while Philip's gaze narrowed.  
As Madam Olsen walked away, she tossed a parting remark over her shoulder. "Nice to meet you, though. I hope you're doing well."  
Madam Cornell raised her chin imperiously as she trailed after Madam Olsen toward the elevator. I cast a perplexed glance at the departing figures.  
This couldn't be real. How had things spiraled into this?  
Madam Olsen cast one final glance back at me, her eyes narrowing with a silent warning before disappearing into the elevator.
###chapter 68: Motorcycle Guardian 
**Sarah**  

Philip pulled me into his private office and pressed me against the door, his lips crashing onto mine in a passionate kiss. His hands gripped my shoulders, holding me firmly in place. 
"Philip, hang on!" I protested, but he ignored me. He scooped me up effortlessly, setting me down on his grand table, my legs dangling off the edge. 
"Philip! Stop!" I said, pushing him away and getting off the table. I moved far from his spot. "I didn't come here for you to flirt with me. Tsk!" I hadn't even recovered from Jane asking for my help with her marriage when I was immediately faced with a new challenge from Madam Olsen. And now, here was Philip with his flirtations. 
"Sorry, I just couldn't help myself after seeing you. So, what brings you here?" he asked with a flirtatious tone. 
"I came here about Jane! Is it true that she's set to get married this weekend?" 
Philip sighed wearily. "Yes, the decision was rather sudden." 
"Why did you agree to marry her off to the Olsens? Is Madam Olsen here to discuss their marriage? You know how she treats people; is that the kind of person you want in your family?" I demanded, unable to hide my frustration. 
He raised a hand, trying to calm me. "Sarah, I can't do anything about it. The Olsens are providing significant funds for the project we're working on now. Moreover, Jane stands to gain considerably from the marriage. That's what we discussed this afternoon." 
"And what do the Olsens get in return? Surely, their family wouldn't agree without gaining some benefits from yours," I said, staring intently at Philip. 
"Jane's role would involve caring for David Olsen's two children, who currently reside in New York. Madam Olsen wanted Jane to be her grandchildren's stepmother. But Jane can still manage some of her own affairs even if she's with the Olsens. I'll make sure she can continue her job," he replied. 
Philip's words hit me like a ton of bricks. "So, you're the one who made all these decisions for Jane?" My frustration bubbled up, impossible to conceal. 
I watched as Philip's expression tightened. "I'm just trying to do what's best for my sister," he muttered, his jaw clenched. 
"But you know this isn't what Jane wants! Do you want her to end up like me, leaving everything behind when she gets married? Do you want her stuck in the Olsen household, tending to the children and her husband? And then, you expect everything to be okay because Jane can get financial support if needed?" I couldn't contain my outrage. 
I had misjudged Philip. I thought this insensitive, self-absorbed prick understood my complaints and the anguish I went through in my own disastrous marriage. But he's just as clueless and insensitive as every other man, willing to sacrifice his sister's happiness for money and status. He seemed determined to stick to his agenda. 
Philip attempted to approach me, but I refused to listen.  
"No! This is all about you and your selfish interests!" I spat venomously. With a sharp exhale, I pushed past Philip's office door, the frustration simmering beneath my skin. Returning to my desk, I buried myself in work throughout the day. 
I was too disgusted to even speak with my ex-husband right now. He kept bombarding me with messages, but I couldn't be bothered to read his predictable string of pathetic apologies and feeble excuses-I simply ignored him! 
All I knew was that Philip was bound for Los Angeles tonight.  
After wrapping up work, I swiftly secured a ticket to Dubai, driven by a dual desire: to seek answers and to create some distance from Philip. Amir sought refuge there, escaping the fallout and scrutiny following his tumultuous wedding to Jessica. He needed a break from prying eyes, and I needed to confer with my grandfather. 
Approaching Jane, I handed her the keys to the villa. "Loves, I won't be returning to Amir's villa for the time being. You'll take care of it. I have pressing matters to attend to tonight." 
She furrowed her brow. "Is Brother Philip accompanying you?" 
"No." If only she knew I didn't want to see her brother right now. "It's related to my job. Please don't tell your brother." 
Jane nodded, though still looking perplexed. When I returned to my workstation, I noticed one of the editorial team members eyeing me curiously. 
"Are you going on a trip?" she inquired. 
"Yes. You can send me a message if there are any issues," I replied, brushing off her scrutiny and focusing on my impending departure. 
*** 
As I headed towards the airport, a white van trailed behind me. I made a turn at a corner, and the van seemed to disappear. Maybe I was imagining things. Perhaps that van wasn't really after me. But just as I thought that it reappeared behind me after several turns, matching my speed. 
The tires protested against the asphalt with a piercing screech as I pressed harder on the accelerator, the engine roaring in response. Adrenaline surged through me, mingling with the sweat that trickled down my forehead. 
"Who are these people?" I murmured to myself. 
Wanting to shake off the van, I veered away from the airport's direction. I wouldn't let them catch me if they had ill intentions. 
Suddenly, a massive motorcycle blocked my path, its rider strategically obstructing my way. Panic surged through me as I slammed on the brakes, narrowly avoiding a collision. My eyes widened in horror as the rider brandished a gun aimed in my direction. 
"Shit!" I cursed under my breath, paralyzed with fear as I awaited my fate. But before I could comprehend the situation, the gunman fired, targeting the van behind me. Shock rendered me speechless as I witnessed the van swerve off course, narrowly escaping the bullet's path. 
The gunman, without a word, lowered his weapon and swiftly departed, leaving me bewildered and shaken. Glancing back, I noticed some of the van's occupants disembarking, seizing the opportunity to make my escape.  
As I drove on, the gravity of the situation weighed heavily on my mind. Heart pounding, I struggled to understand the chaos around me. 
'What the heck is going on?' I wondered, struggling to make sense of the bizarre events that had just unfolded.  
Despite feeling paranoid and anxious, I tried to regain my composure, reminding myself I was cutting it close for my trip to Dubai.  
'Who were those people, and why were they after me?'  
While I waited at the boarding area, my pulse quickened as my cellphone rang, revealing Philip's face on the screen.  
"Oh, what does he want now?" I muttered, answering the call with a curt "Hello?" 
"Woman, where are you? Trey said you're missing." Philip's voice bristled with impatience.  
"Philip, you're annoying! I have a trip, alright?" I replied. 
"Where? Are you leaving after abandoning your job at the office? Do you think you can just do anything? Leave whenever you want?" he accused. 
"How about you? Do you think you can meddle in someone else's life? You're stressing me, and that's why I'm taking my leave! Listen, I don't want to disrupt your editorial team. They know what they're doing." I shot back, feeling the weight of his expectations suffocating me.  
Philip's editorial team was just irritated with me and didn't understand my role there. 
"My role is to ensure that Chronografix has no problems and works fine. I have another job." 
"No, because your job is to ensure I'll see you every day, and you leaving town doesn't make sense at all." 
I was left speechless, anger boiling beneath the surface. "You're a pervert! Do you realize how inappropriate you sound?" I snapped, drawing puzzled glances from those nearby. 
Before the situation could escalate further, I abruptly ended the call, opting to avoid a scene. While waiting, my thoughts drifted to the events of the evening. Who was the mysterious individual who came to my rescue on the motorcycle? And who were the occupants of that white van? Is my safety now at risk? 
And then there's Madam Olsen. Is her resemblance to my mother merely coincidental, or is there something more to it?
###chapter 69: Mother
Sarah  

Amir orchestrated the arrangement for Grandpa Mitchell's chauffeur to await my arrival at the bustling Dubai airport, effortlessly sparing me of any travel hassles. From Highland Hills, I had informed my family of my forthcoming visit to the stately mansion. 
Exhaustion enveloped me like a heavy cloak, and the yearning for sleep permeated every fiber of my being. Despite flying business class, I was utterly drained and craving sleep. The flight had been tiring, especially with my mind in such turmoil. 
As I stepped through the mansion's grand entrance, weary from travel, Amir's welcoming presence enveloped me. Despite the late hour, his warm greeting reassured me of being home. Amanda stood beside him, wearing a welcoming smile. 
"Are you alright?" Amir asked worriedly as I got out of the car. 
I wasn't sure if I should talk to him after he told Jessica what happened between me and Marcus. 
"I'm fine. Why do you ask?" 
Amir crossed his arms and voiced his assumption. "This trip came out of nowhere. As far as I know, it's only been a few days since you went to your crazy ex-husband's office. It's not even a week, Sarah. You have a job there. You would only take such a sudden trip if something bad happened." 
"Well, you're right. Where is Grandpa Mitchell?" I asked. Before I delve into the matters clouding my mind with Amir, I need to discuss them when our grandfather is around, especially since it concerns my mother. It's been another day already. 
"He's resting," he replied. 
"Okay. I'm exhausted. Let's talk tomorrow morning," I said. 
Amir nodded understanding and led me to my room, Amanda following with my carry-on bag. 
At the door, Amir pulled me into a hug. "I'm really sorry Honestly, I'm ashamed of myself." 
"Just make sure Jessica won't go crazy sharing those things. I could handle your ex in a way no cosmetic surgery could fix!" 
He pursed his lips. "Get some rest. See you tomorrow, sis." 
Once Amir was gone, Amanda immediately pulled me into a tight embrace. She'd been holding back with him there, and Amir would have given her a hard time about manners. 
"I know we just caught up at Boss Amir's engagement, but I missed you so much. Why couldn't I come with you?" she said. "Anyway, I've already prepared your bed and everything." 
I squeezed her back. The room was neatly arranged, and Amanda had laid out some clothes for me to change into. 
"I'm bringing you this time." 
Her eyes widened. "Really?" 
I gave a solemn nod. I needed Amanda's support whether I liked it or not. Besides, she cooks well and would certainly keep me away from Philip. That's right! 
After freshening up, I collapsed onto the bed, allowing exhaustion to overtake me. 
*** 
I had anticipated an early wake-up, but I was wrong. I ended up waking up almost in the afternoon. Amanda and another helper tended to me, preparing a luxurious bath infused with delightful scents and even indulging me with massages as I soaked. It felt like royalty treatment, making me wish everyone treated me this way without needing words. 
After getting dressed, Amanda guided me to the dining area, where she had prepared a meal fit for a queen. Once I'd savored every bite and felt satisfied, I sought out Grandpa Mitchell and Amir. Fortunately, I found them in the library, where Grandpa greeted me by lowering his glasses, momentarily setting aside the document he had been engrossed in. 
"Wow! I appreciate your remark about morning," Amir said sarcastically. 
"Sorry, I'm just utterly exhausted. I ended up sleeping longer than planned," I apologized, trying to shake off the grogginess. 
"Don't mind him! I'm the one who ordered not to wake you up," Grandpa Mitchell said. 
I approached him and kissed him on the cheek. I frowned when I noticed the documents on his table. 
"Considering you're retired, why are you still dealing with these?" I inquired Grandpa. 
"Who else can I count on for this task? You, who seem to roam everywhere? If you were handling this responsibility, I wouldn't be concerned," my grandfather remarked. Despite being retired, he still invested substantially in various companies worth millions of dollars. His days were consumed by analyzing the market to ensure profitable outcomes. 
"You're aware I prefer not to discuss finances," I reminded him gently. 
He sighed wearily, segueing into a topic that always made me uneasy. "Sarah, this is precisely why I hope you'll consider marrying Bronn. Do you understand?" 
My response was guarded. "Well, we are doing good. We're friends." I muttered, unable to fully conceal my reluctance. 
Amir's gaze lingered on me, a silent acknowledgment passing between us. Despite his awareness of my frequent outings with Philip, out of respect for our grandfather's peace of mind, he refrained from commenting on the matter. 
"So, what's the sudden reason for your visit?" Amir finally broached the topic. 
I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the revelation I would share. "I saw Mother," I revealed. 
Amir's reaction was one of pure shock, his body almost propelling him out of his seat.  "Whaaat?" 
"I saw Mother, Amir, Grandpa," I reiterated, trembling slightly. "I-I thought she was dead? But I saw her at the Luminary Productions office, and her son is about to marry my best friend, Jane." 
Grandpa Mitchell's expression hardened, his eyes narrowing as he processed my words. "That's probably not your mother, Sarah." 
Amir's confusion was palpable. "Hang on! W-what do you mean you saw Mother? Is this some kind of prank? You know very well that she passed away!" he exclaimed. 
"But who else could it be? Who is Madam Olsen, who looks exactly like my mother? Why did she flinch when I introduced myself?" I insisted. 
"Madam Olsen?" Amir repeated, his brow furrowed. 
Grandpa Mitchell cleared his throat, his expression grave. "She's my daughter, but definitely not your mother, Sarah." 
Amir and I exchanged stunned glances, grappling with the revelation. "What do you mean, Grandpa?" 
"She's your mother's twin!" Grandpa Mitchell revealed. The truth hung heavy in the air, leaving us all reeling from Madam Olsen's identity implications. "You have to be careful with that woman. She betrayed me once, even though I'm her father. I wouldn't be surprised if she did the same to you."
###chapter 70: Corrupt Doctor 
**Sarah**  

"Grandpa, what do you mean she's my mother's twin?" Amir asked, clearly surprised by the revelation. The furrowed lines on his brow revealed that he, too, had been utterly unaware our mother had an identical twin sibling. 
Grandpa Mitchell let out a weary sigh before delving into the story. "Back when my business and youth consumed me, I dedicated all my time to work, inadvertently creating a divide between my wife and me. After a misunderstanding, we agreed to separate; your mom stayed with me while Marietta went with her mother. 
"In those days, I maintained a connection with Marietta and continued to support her. My wife remarried, and I thought everything had settled. Little did I realize the simmering jealousy Marietta harbored toward your mom. Despite my efforts, they never seemed to get along. As time passed, both my daughters pursued their education. Your mom excelled, becoming a licensed accountant and eventually an economist like myself, which filled me with pride. 
"However, your mom's achievements seemed only to intensify Marietta's envy. To appease her destructive behavior and prevent further family rifts, I foolishly gave Marietta control over managing my finances, assets, and client networks." 
His expression twisted in self-reproach. "She took ruthless advantage of my trust. Marietta slowly manipulated the situation to steal my business, wealth, and everything I had spent my life building right from under my nose. As her father, I can accept many things, but being betrayed by my own child is a wound that cuts deep." 
A glistening tear formed in my grandpa's eye as his voice grew heavy with pain. "Fast forward again to the most painful part: she's the reason why your mom was kidnapped back then. I never suspected she'd plan to assume your mom's identity after I cut ties with her.  
"Your mom was married, had an intelligent son, and held a high reputation in the finance industry But then Marcus returned your mother..."  
I shuddered involuntarily at the mere mention of that name. 
"The full, ugly truth may never have come to light if not for the events putting young Sarah's safety at grave risk back then and your dear mother's tragic passing in that terrible fire. I'd warned her to keep away from both of you. I want nothing to do with her, especially when it comes to you two." 
My trembling only intensified, and a wave of nausea swept over me as my vision blurred once more. This panic attack overwhelmed me, and a tidal wave of fear, sadness, and anxiety flooded my mind.  
Amir's intense gaze bored straight through me.  
"Sarah!" His voice drew closer, but then the world around me dissolved entirely into black oblivion as I crumpled, slipping into unconsciousness. 
*** 
When I awoke, I was nestled in bed, greeted by watchful eyes. Among them were Amir, Grandpa Mitchell, Amanda, and another household member, along with Dr. Morgan's unexpected presence. 
My gaze sharpened as it landed on him. In a low, accusing tone, I demanded, "What brings you here?" 
He took a cautious step back. "It appears Ms. Mitchell woke up feeling unwell," the doctor replied, attempting to maintain composure. 
Amir interjected to try to explain the situation. "Sarah, Dr. Morgan is your physician, isn't he?  I have a scheduled consultation with him this afternoon to discuss some matters, and he just happened to arrive at the mansion when you fainted."  
I clenched my jaw, directing a fierce stare at the doctor. "Ha! Does Amir know what unspeakable things you did to me?" 
This caught the attention of my grandfather. With a concerned brow furrow, he questioned, "What did he do?" 
"Ms. Mitchell, I'm not sure what you're insinuating!" the doctor hastily replied. "I think Ms. Mitchell may still be experiencing the aftereffects of her panic attack." 
I couldn't help but let out a mocking chuckle; a smirk tugged at the corner of my lips. 
"What did he do to you, Sarah?" Amir asked, visibly unsettled by my demeanor. 
"He's trying to kill me by giving me medicine for psychosis! I found out those kinds of medications could potentially weaken my heart over time. So, for months, as I became increasingly dependent on the drugs he prescribed, I experienced worsening symptoms-running out of breath easily, constant anxiety, and inability to get restful sleep. I thought I was developing heart failure! But the truth is, he's been systematically trying to poison me and make me think I was dying!" 
"What?" My grandfather's voice boomed with fury, his eyes ablaze with anger. 
"Mr. Benner, please, don't believe her words. Ms. Mitchell is experiencing hallucinations! You're aware of her history of mental health struggles. She had a panic attack earlier. She's simply having another psychotic episode." 
One of my purposes in coming to Dubai was to confront Dr. Morgan. It seemed he doubted my readiness. I stood up and delivered a resounding slap across his face, marking the first time I did for him. 
I grabbed the stack of incriminating documents from the nightstand drawer where I had neatly organized the compilation of evidence last night. They contained Josh's investigations against him, results from my medical tests, and more.  
I thrust the first document at him. "Here are the results of my heart medical test from last year. The initial diagnosis was that I had a weakened heart condition. But this deceitful monster made me believe I only had a year left to live! And I believed him because I trusted you, brother!" 
Amir's expression contorted with rage, and he clenched his fists tightly.  
"This is undoubtedly fabricated!" the doctor retorted, disgustingly persisting in his lies. 
Undeterred, I continued, "Oh! Allow me to clarify the misconception about my cardiac health," as I produced the following prescriptions, listing the medications he had prescribed to me. "He had me take these medicines directly from him!" 
I presented the results I received from the hospital in Highland Hills, dating back to the day I saw him with Madam Cornell, and hurled those reports at the doctor.  
"After requesting the hospital to analyze the medications he prescribed to me over the past year, I uncovered the true contents of those medicines. He gave me medications for psychosis while his report diagnosed me with a weak heart. Everything is detailed in those reports." 
I threw every document until my hands were empty. "And to top it off, I discovered you embezzled money from people by doing this! I am not your first victim, you evil monster!" 
Amir's hands gripped the doctor's collar tightly, his voice booming with rage. "Why did you do this to Sarah?" 
"Reynolds!" Amir barked, summoning his assistant. Only then did I notice the man standing quietly in the corner of the room. 
"Boss?" 
"Gather all that evidence from Sarah! Ensure this lunatic is stripped of his license and can never practice medicine again!"  
"Mr. Benner, please, you mustn't trust her lies! Ms. Mitchell is nothing but a manipulative, lying bitch! She's twisting the truth!" 
At that moment, I wanted to punch him, but before I could react, Amir struck first-his closed fist connecting with the doctor's cheek.  
"What do you mean Sarah's fooling us? Are you saying my granddaughter is going crazy?" Grandpa Mitchell's gravelly voice rang out. 
"You, old fool! Mind your own business!" The arrogant doctor sneered and retorted audaciously against my grandfather.  
This moron! 
I couldn't believe the idiot's brazen insult of my grandfather. Clearly, he had no clue about Grandpa Mitchell's power and influence, assuming he was simply an older adult based on his casual white t-shirt and shorts. No outsiders knew of our true identities. 
"Guards!" Grandpa Mitchell bellowed, his frail body trembling with an intensity of fury. His eyes blazed with undisguised wrath as he instructed Reynolds. "Inform Director Monroe about this individual. I don't want to see him even as a shadow!" 
Director Monroe held the esteemed position of overseeing the entire medical facility where the disgraced Dr. Morgan practiced his profession. The renowned hospital relied heavily on the generous financial backing provided by my grandfather's vast wealth. Dr. Monroe also served as my grandfather's personal physician. 
I exclaimed, "You're dead!"  
Amir's rage was palpable; his face flushed crimson. "You tried to kill my sister and then insult our grandfather. You're the lowest scum!" 
Dr. Morgan's eyes bulged, suddenly registering who we were. "W-What? You're part of the Benner family? B-But Mr. Benner, this is all a misunderstanding! I thought Ms. Mitchell was your mistress-Jessica Woods and Madam Cornell from Highland Hills, both confirmed it! I was following their instructions! Please spare me!" 
The doctor's world quickly turned upside down as he realized his mistake. 
Amir's punch landed squarely on his face, especially stinging upon learning of his ex-girlfriend's involvement. 
The doctor crawled toward me. "M-Ms. Mitchell, I beg you! I'll do anything you ask; please spare me!" 
I looked at him with utter disgust. "That's the problem! As a Benner, I cautiously extend chances to people!" 
With that, the guards unceremoniously seized the doctor and tossed him out of the mansion. Amir couldn't meet my gaze, overwhelmed with embarrassment. 
"Sarah, it's time to reveal the real you! I don't care if you won't use the Benner name, but I won't tolerate anyone disrespecting you, even under your Mitchell name! Even though I'm old, I'm the one who still has complete control over your mother's legacy, which should be you," Grandpa nearly suffered a heart attack from anger. 
My throat felt tight as I considered his words. "I... I'll think about it." 
"Do it, Sarah! People are bullying you, and I can't bear it anymore!" Amir urged. 
"I'll give you time to think. I'll be the one to train you!" Grandpa declared, ending the conversation. 
As evening fell, I was surprised to see visitors. Yes, visitors! 
Bronn Martin and my brutish ex-husband, Philip Cornell, awaited at the front gate. And I didn't know what to do!
###chapter 71: Clues and Uncertainty 
**Sarah**  

"Miss, are you okay?" Amanda asked, her voice laced with concern as she noticed my silence while we stood together in the garden. The commotion from Dr. Morgan's incident had just subsided. 
I couldn't bring myself to answer her inquiry about my well-being. Reflecting on Grandpa Mitchell's wish for me to join his business, I understood his reasons. However, deep down, I knew his desire was for me to marry Bronn. I looked at the vibrant red flowers, then let my eyes drift to the setting sun, seeking solace in its fading light. 
"I miss my baby" I murmured, the words escaping my lips like a sorrowful gasp.  
My child proves that Philip and I are not meant for each other. "I don't want people's prying eyes. I've made so many wrong decisions in my life. That's why I chose a job where I can conceal myself. But I'm questioning if I'm truly happy. Am I really content with the life I chose? Maybe Dr. Morgan is right; I am losing my grip on reality." 
"Oh, Miss! The feelings you're experiencing are completely normal for a mother who has endured such a profound loss. No doctor can dictate or invalidate the complex emotions you're grappling with. Your feelings are valid," she reassured me. 
"I'm always thankful you're by my side, Amanda. If you weren't here, I don't know what would have happened to me." Tears welled up in my eyes. 
"You know that I love you. I'm not in a position to meddle in your life, and the only thing I can offer is advice. Uh, haven't you thought about starting a new family? I've seen Mr. Bronn Martin a few times, and he seems like a good, honorable man." Her words were tentative as if testing the waters. 
Bronn was the only person I could envision loving me unconditionally, but a nagging doubt lingered-was he my second chance? Months back, I had already decided to give Bronn a chance and open my heart to the possibility of a new love, but Philip's constant presence in my life made it impossible to pursue that path. 
Amanda smiled at me. "Do you know why I love you, Miss Sarah? Because you're a good person." 
Overwhelmed by her kindness, I stepped forward and embraced her. If there's one person in this world who wouldn't hurt me besides Grandpa Mitchell, it's Amanda. 
When I returned to my room, I realized I hadn't checked my phone, which had died after the long trip home. I had already asked my people to charge it. As soon as I powered it on, a flood of unread messages filled the screen-from Philip, Bronn, and Jakob, among others. 
I hadn't even started reading the text messages, my head was begging to ache, especially seeing the many unread messages from Philip. I decided to read Jakob's message first because I had something for him to do. 
***Jakob:*** *We need to discuss what I uncovered. Let's connect on our secure video meeting platform.* 
He meant the encrypted online conferencing link we've been utilizing on our private server to guarantee complete confidentiality and safeguard against potential breaches or eavesdropping threats. As I scrutinized his message, my brows furrowed into a concerned frown. 
***Me:*** *I've just been charged. Connect to the server immediately!* 
I swiftly grabbed my laptop and joined Jakob online. His fatigued countenance emerged on the screen, enveloped by dim surroundings, signaling the early morning hours in Henderson. 
"Oh, damn! I forgot it's early morning there. Haven't you slept yet?" I inquired sympathetically. 
"Someone of interest has returned to their residence." He's talking about me. "I'm conducting investigations on behalf of both Bronn and you simultaneously. How can one possibly sleep under such circumstances?" Jakob grumbled, taking the rim of his coffee mug to his lips, relying on the caffeinated beverage to sustain his wakefulness. 
Curious about his findings, I leaned in. "So, what did you uncover?" 
His gaze remained unwavering, his eyes locking with mine through the digital screen that separated us. "First off, any idea why your ex-husband needs a small army of bodyguards? He's got, what, seven in total?" 
I shrugged. "I never really paid attention to how many bodyguards he had. I just figured it was normal for important people like him to have many of them. You know, like Bronn, Chairman Cornell, my brother, even my grandpa. They all have their own security teams whenever they go out," I said, sounding pretty casual about it. 
"But doesn't it strike you odd that Philip Cornell has so many?" 
Now that he had brought the matter to my attention, I could not help but acknowledge his observation. "Why the sudden interest in his security detail?" 
"Okay, about the investigation. I was unable to locate any surveillance cameras in the vicinity of the location where you claimed the encounter with the motorcyclist occurred. It's almost as if your presence there was anticipated. But, one street camera caught the motorbike. I'll share the footage." 
In just seconds, the face of the person who had boldly threatened me with a gun that scary night in Highland Hills City appeared on my screen, bringing back the frightening memory vividly. 
"Is this the guy who pulled the gun on you?" Jakob asked. 
"That's him." 
"Did you book your ticket at Philip Cornell's office?" 
"You're absolutely right, but I took precautions. A VPN always shields my laptop while I work-wherever possible. Especially at Luminary Productions. I mean, what exactly are we discussing here?" I couldn't stop myself from asking as a creeping sense of anxiety started to spread under my skin. 
"It's still regarding the investigation you tasked me with. Philip didn't go to New York as he claimed. He stayed in Highland Hills and met with someone named Mariano. Mariano is a significant supporter at Luminary Productions, likely a key reason your ex-husband holds the presidency." 
Even when Philip and I were married, I purposefully avoided getting too tangled up in his work matters. All I knew was that he drank a lot, and I thought his breakup with Megan was the cause. 
"Sarah, are you familiar with who Mariano is?" Jakob asked gravely. "He's the person referred to as the godfather of racing." 
My lips quivered. Of course, I was familiar with Mariano. He had once set his sights on me, making unwanted advances. But what most people don't realize, he didn't participate in racing; he simply oversees it, entangled in illicit activities related to the sport. 
"Mariano Luca?" I uttered his name. 
"Exactly. Philip Cornell is currently Mariano's favored 'godson.' Most of your ex-husband's bodyguards, Josh included, are chosen and managed by Mariano. But hardly anyone seems to notice this arrangement. Usually, it's just Mariano's representatives conducting any transactions, but I believe Philip has met with the man himself on occasion." 
"So you're saying Mariano essentially holds Philip's life in his hands?" I asked carefully. 
Jakob gave a solemn nod, pursing his lips.  
"How did you uncover this?" 
"It started with me digging into Josh's past and what he's been up to," Jakob clarified. "That led me to check out the backgrounds of Mr. Philip Cornell's other bodyguards, too, just to ensure you were safe. Then, I found out they're all linked to Mariano. Recall when we questioned Josh's existence under Philip's authority? Turns out, Mariano was the one who put Josh in that position. Mariano knows exactly who Josh is, even if Philip doesn't have a clue." 
I never could have imagined that Philip's life was entangled in such complicated webs. 
Jakob continued, "Now, this is just my own assumption, Sarah. I want to be clear-I lack concrete evidence from the investigation. But I believe the white van tailing you the other night belonged to Mariano's group. And I think it was Philip Cornell himself who saved you from them that night." 
My eyes widened at Jakob's revelation.
###chapter 72: Masks of Deception 
**Sarah**  

I fell silent momentarily, carefully considering the mysterious person on the motorcycle. He was clad in a black leather jacket, which made me doubtful it could be Philip. My former husband would never don such rebellious attire. Philip had also never brandished a gun before.  
The only thing my ex-husband did was perv on me. That mysterious man's behavior is far from Philip's personality. 
However, when I looked more closely at the person's body shape and height, an unsettling thought crept into my mind: it could indeed be Philip. 
"How did you connect or think that person was Philip?" I asked Jakob. 
"Because of this." Jakob showed me surveillance footage of the motorcycle passing through a particular street. "That road leads to Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt's mansion. I also got a clear shot of the motorcycle's plate number, and guess what, the motorcycle is registered to Philip Cornell." 
My lips parted involuntarily in a small grimace of shock. 
"Before you think your rescuer might be Dr. Vanderbilt, remember it's impossible. The doctor is taller than Philip Cornell and has a different body shape. You were at the scene. Can you say that Dr. Vanderbilt was that mysterious man?" 
No! 
To this day, I still don't fully know Philip. "He called me that night with such nonchalance, as if utterly oblivious to my situation. The tone of his voice was so normal, so casual when he inquired about my whereabouts. Are you saying he knew I was at the airport that evening?" 
"Yes, Sarah, because he's Philip Cornell! You were in Highland Hills, and he likely figured out where you were and tracked your movements." 
Not only that, but I even considered letting him stay at Amir's house! Damn it! 
Jakob asked, "You said earlier that you booked a ticket to Dubai at the Cornell office. Did anyone notice you?" 
"I spoke to Jane. I told her I wasn't going to Amir's villa because I had a business trip. I entrusted her with the security keys to the villa. However, when I returned to my workstation, I fear someone may have noticed my intended destination displayed on the computer screen." 
Jakob's face soured. "You didn't lock your computer?" 
"I-I forgot..." 
Jakob could no longer hide his frustration and unleashed a stream of stern warnings. "Sarah, I hate to say this, but if you add Philip to the many people who want to kill you, you're just digging your own grave. Madam Cornell wanted to kill you, and so did those bitches Jessica and Megan. Who else?" 
'Marcus!' I inwardly reminded myself.  
Jakob remained unaware of the situation, and I was reluctant to burden him further. His words struck true, leaving me unable to offer a response. 
"What do you truly desire, Sarah?" Jakob pressed gently. 
"Jake, the truth is, for the past few months, I've been convinced I was battling heart failure. My sole ambition was to find someone who could love me. I wanted to experience the beauty of being loved by a man, something that was cruelly denied to me in the past. With my death looming, I doubted I'd achieve much else. All I wanted was to embrace self-love while helping you fulfill your dreams..." 
My confession caught him off guard. "I told Bronn not to include me in the official list of LoveLogic developers because I want to leave this world quietly when my time comes. I don't want people thinking I'm trying to use my impending death as a marketing ploy for our game application." 
"But then," I continued heavily, "I discovered the truth; I became confused. It was like being violently yanked back to square one! And then Philip reappeared. I find myself wanting to change my perception of him-to understand or maybe even justify to myself why I loved him so deeply before," I confessed to Jakob. 
"Sarah..." Sadness clouded Jakob's expression. "You're only complicating matters. Do you realize that? You know you two can't be together again, right?" 
I nodded solemnly, hot tears pricking my eyes. "I'm painfully aware. With Madam Cornell and Megan in the picture, a future with Philip seems impossible. His whole family dislikes me, and as long as his mother is around, Philip and I can't move forward." 
"From what I've witnessed, Philip Cornell isn't good for you. Haven't you forgotten how much pain and heartbreak he caused you? As your friend, I must remind you-you don't seem to realize he's still treating you like a doormat, just as he did before." Jakob spoke with earnest concern. 
I pursed my lips at his blunt assessment but offered no argument. As much as it stung to admit it, I knew Jakob spoke the truth. 
"He's a manipulative bastard, Sarah! You're not free to do as you please because Philip still has an unhealthy grip on you! Even the bodyguards he assigns to watch over you and supposedly protect you are untrustworthy. Well, I think Trey is different because he's the only one I've seen who has no shadowy connection to Mariano." 
Trey had been there as Philip's bodyguard even before my ill-fated marriage to Philip. 
"Sarah, you need to safeguard your heart. Philip Cornell allowed his ex, Megan, to stay at Serenity Pines Estate. Do you still think they have no inappropriate relationship going on? He subjected you to so much mistreatment in the past! He confined you to Serenity Pines while he did as he pleased. I won't let you return to Luminary Productions for the sake of this project. I'll speak with Bronn." 
I no longer argued with Jakob because he made very rational points that resonated with me. 
Following my conversation with Jakob, I delved into Philip's messages. He was searching for me as if bewildered by my absence. I gathered my thoughts and confronted the full reality of how Philip had coldly betrayed me until the very bitter end. For a few misguided weeks, I had foolishly forgotten my original goal because Philip had been around me, trying to reel me back in no doubt. What an idiot I've been! 
"Miss, it's time for dinner," Amanda roused me from my thoughts. 
I nodded and trailed behind her to the dining area, formulating my plans in my mind. Upon arrival, Grandpa Mitchell and Amir were already seated. 
I drew in a deep, steadying breath, ready to articulate my thoughts and intentions. "I'm accepting your offer, Grandpa," I declared with resolve. "I'm going to take charge of managing my late mother's stocks, funds, and assets that she left to me." 
Grandpa Mitchell nodded in approval while Amir looked directly at me. "Are you absolutely certain about this, Sarah? Remember, you might face opposition from Dad in the business. There are also plenty of others who will sadly underestimate your capabilities just because you're a woman." 
"I'm not worried. Grandpa will support me." 
Grandpa Mitchell smiled proudly at my resolve. 
"Furthermore," I continued, "I intend to strengthen my influence." 
"Oh? How do you plan to do that?" Amir asked, still sounding a bit conscious about what my plans fully entailed. 
"I'll accept Bronn." 
Before they could reply, Grandpa's security guard purposefully entered the dining area. "Excuse me, sir, for interrupting your family time. We have visitors for Ms. Sarah..."   
Both men seated at the table immediately directed their attention towards me. I shrugged, unaware of who the visitors might be.   
"It's President Cornell and Bronn Martin," the guard declared.
###chapter 73: Double Life 
**Philip** 
*\[The other night\]* 

An encrypted message from Mariano blinked on my screen, summoning me to meet at the secluded Neon River location. Despite still fuming from a heated argument with Sarah during our last encounter, I knew better than to defy Mariano's call. I rearranged my entire afternoon schedule to make it happen. 
From Ethan's mansion, I drove to Neon River. Usually, I met with Mariano alone, without bodyguards, to maintain a low profile. Most people in Highland Hills know me, and drawing unwanted attention to Neon River could implicate me in unpleasant speculation. 
Mariano's jet-black Aston Martin emerged from the shadows as I approached in a sleek silhouette. His assistant approached me and demanded, "Give me your keys." 
I didn't get along with this lowlife; he was probably jealous of Mariano's trust in me. 
Initially hesitant to relinquish control of my vehicle, my gaze shifted to Mariano seated inside, casually exhaling plumes of aromatic smoke through the partially open window. His nonchalant indifference to the tense exchange convinced me to comply without protest. I surrendered my keys into the awaiting palm. 
One of the guards opened the door, and I got in next to Mariano. The car reeked of tobacco smoke, but I didn't show any sign of discomfort. I couldn't afford to cough or show weakness in that confined space. 
Mariano has helped me a lot with business. Thanks to his strategies, I was gaining more and more success. The main difference between us was that Mariano also operated illegally, and I was one of his pawns, especially in racing, while all my bonds and stocks in the market were legal. 
I wanted to ask him, 'What is it this time?' but I waited for his instructions instead. I never dared to question any of his actions.  
"Let's go!" he finally uttered, prompting his driver to start the ignition as another associate roared my own vehicle's engine to life.  
My mind was brimming with curiosity about where Mariano and I were headed. His vehicle pulled up beside the port where a large yacht was docked. 
"You'll represent me tonight inside that yacht, Philip," Mariano said. This wasn't an unusual request; I had frequently acted as his emissary for over a year on various matters. 
"What exactly do you need me to do?" I inquired, seeking clarification on the specifics of the task at hand. 
"The person there will show you documents I'll use against one of my business rivals. They'll explain everything to you, and you will obtain my contracts and certificates. Your sole responsibility is to listen attentively and avoid engaging in any discourse. Once you have acquired the documents, return here immediately and share the information they have conveyed." 
Following Mariano's instructions, I got out of the vehicle and approached his assistant to retrieve the key to my motorcycle, which I had previously surrendered. The assistant, seemingly reluctant, regarded me with a hard stare but eventually relinquished the key. 
Two guards followed me inside the yacht. To my surprise, I saw Madam Olsen having dinner, the person Mariano was transacting with. She wiped her mouth, a slight smile playing at the corners of her lips. Remembering Mariano's instruction to remain silent, I kept my questions to myself. 
Madam Olsen handed me the documents and began explaining them. I reviewed them carefully. 
"Looks like the rumors are true. You're Mariano's new favorite," Madam Olsen said, sipping her wine. "Where's he hiding?" 
I ignored her, following Mariano's directive not to engage in conversation. "The documents are complete. Thank you, Madam Olsen." 
I placed the documents in the steel case and nodded at her.  
As I turned to depart, Madam Olsen's next words stopped me in my tracks, reigniting the curiosity that had been simmering beneath the surface. "I have another envelope here, one that pertains to your ex-wife, Sarah." 
She placed the envelope on the table, her long, crimson-tinted fingers tapping impatiently. 
"Madam Olsen, did you investigate my wife?" I couldn't help but ask, triggered by her comment. 
One of Mariano's guards immediately issued a stern warning, "President Cornell, remember, no talking!" 
"I've just performed a simple task, President Cornell. Inside this envelope lies the repository of all your wife's secrets," urged Madam Olsen. Her words hung heavy in the air, instantly capturing my curiosity like a moth to a flame. What could she possibly know about Sarah that I didn't? 
"I'm already aware of the situation regarding Sarah. How can I be certain the documents you'll present aren't fabricated?" I questioned. 
Madam Cornell nodded in agreement. "Indeed." 
"I've already conducted my investigation into Sarah. I have resources similar to yours, Madam Olsen. Therefore, I no longer need your assistance. Thank you." With a firm turn, I withdrew from her presence, unwilling to waste more time. 
Yet, Madam Olsen persisted, evidently intent on testing my patience. "Really? Have you also investigated why you've been utterly unable to uncover any trace of Sarah's real identity due to her immense technological prowess?" 
"What do you mean by that?" I inquired, arching an eyebrow. 
"President Cornell!" The guard barked out a warning, his voice raised in alarm. 
"I'll offer you a single clue, and that's all... Sarah Mitchell is a top-tier graduate of the prestigious Crestwood University. She's a highly skilled and exceptionally talented computer software engineer-devastatingly good at covering her tracks. That is precisely why you've found unearthing any evidence of her existence impossible. She has mastered the art of ensuring no trace is left behind." Madam Olsen divulged, her revelation hitting me like a bolt from the blue. 
"She makes certain she leaves no trail because of her expertise. Any online information will be seamlessly deleted, and any investigation stymied by her skills. But here's the real revelation, President Cornell-she accomplished all these activities right beneath your nose at the Serenity Pines Estate for the past three years!" 
What? Sarah accomplished all that? 
"Madam Olsen, are you insinuating that Sarah carried out all you've disclosed at Serenity Pines Estate without my knowledge?" I exclaimed incredulously. 
"Yes, President Cornell, because, quite simply, you never paid any mind to Sarah in the past." 
My eyes flickered, my fist involuntarily clenched, acknowledging the veracity of her statement. 
Madam Olsen kept going, keeping me hooked with her insights into Sarah. "And guess what? She even got someone to sneak into your villa while you two were apart. She made sure the computer she used left no tracks. Maybe I've said too much already. You'll see all the proof in this file, President Cornell. Now, it's my turn-I want to know who Mariano is." 
With a surging sense of urgency, as if my very life hinged upon it, I snatched the envelope from the table. Madam Olsen's eyes widened in shock at my abrupt action, but I did not heed her startled expression. 
"President Cornell!" Madam Olsen shouted angrily, her voice reverberating across the deck. Ignoring her loud reaction, I quickly moved towards the exit of the yacht, taking long steps until I reached the shiny Aston Martin parked nearby. 
I handed the requested documents to Mariano's assistant, retaining possession of the other mysterious envelope.  
The assistant's gaze hardened as he scrutinized the additional envelope. "What are you concealing? You're in serious trouble, President Cornell!" 
"These documents are mine!" I bellowed in defiance. 
A voice boomed from the yacht's loudspeaker, unmistakably Madam Olsen's. "Mariano, President Cornell has just committed theft. He seized a document that was not part of our agreement." 
Clearly displeased with my insolent response, the assistant spoke urgently into the microphone clipped to his neckline. "Attention, everyone! By direct order of the boss: Execute Sarah Mitchell!" 
Fuck!  
Shock rippled through the surroundings as it became apparent that the order stemmed from the assistant himself, not Mariano. Reacting instinctively, I seized the moment and struck the assistant with a forceful punch. I snatched his firearm before leaping onto my waiting motorcycle and peeling away at maximum speed. 
"Fuck, fuck, fuck!" I cursed repeatedly, panic gripping me as the gravity of this escalating situation became evident. This catastrophic turn was undoubtedly my own damn fault! Damn it all! 
Turning to Trey for information on Sarah's whereabouts, I discovered they could not locate my ex-wife. Thankfully, she used my car, allowing me to track her via GPS. 
In a final attempt to shield others from the chaotic whirlwind that had enveloped my existence, I opted to keep my darker side hidden. Yet, my assumption proved to be misguided.
###chapter 74: Uncovering Identity 
**Philip** 

The GPS guided me to Sarah's current location. A knot of dread formed in my gut as I twisted the throttle, pushing my motorcycle to dangerous speeds through the city streets. I had to reach her before Mariano's team. The sleek white van stayed behind, mimicking my vehicle's movements like a sinister shadow. 
Shit! 
Determined to catch up with Sarah's vehicle, I took a shortcut through a narrow alleyway. My motorcycle's tires screeched loudly as I abruptly stopped in the middle of the road, following my instincts while fear coursed through my veins. I anxiously waited for Sarah's approaching vehicle, and despite wearing my helmet, I could distinctly see her eyes widen in surprise as she rolled to a stop mere feet away from me, our vehicles separated by a hairbreadth. 
The driver's side window shattered in a spray of deadly glass shards. After making sure the bullet hit the driver, I got back on the motorcycle and sped off again before Sarah could recognize me. At least the van would no longer be able to follow her! 
My jaw clenched until it ached. Mariano promised he wouldn't involve Sarah! Sarah shouldn't have any idea about my chaotic life! 
But I knew the fault ultimately lay with me and the choices I'd made, the devil's bargain I'd struck more than a year ago. 
I headed straight to Ethan's sprawling mansion on the outskirts of town. I went to the living room after parking the motorbike in his secluded basement garage. There he was, sitting cross-legged, engrossed in Netflix's Bridgerton series! 
Shaking, I tried to calm myself, tossing my helmet onto the wide couch alongside the envelope holding secrets. 
"Damn it!" I cursed! 
"What's wrong with you, bro? Are you alright?" Ethan asked. 
"Hang on! I have to call Sarah!" I called Sarah using my usual tone to make sure she was alright. I also wanted to know if she recognized me. It seemed she didn't notice anything unusual. She hid the incident well, too! 
After a brief conversation, that woman hung up on me! Damn it! 
"What the fuck is going on?" Ethan asked, coming closer to me. "You suddenly appeared here like you just crawled out of a warzone." 
That's when Mariano called me! The phone rang, so I answered it first, disregarding Ethan's question. 
"Mariano, you promised me you wouldn't touch my ex-wife!" I shouted; my anger palpable in the trembling of my voice. "That asshole assistant of yours is really aggravating me!" 
"That's why he's dead, Philip!" Mariano's tone was firm, causing my eyes to widen. His dissatisfaction with tonight's outcome was palpable. The one who ended up dead could have easily been me. "But let's be clear, you didn't exactly follow orders either. You allowed your emotions to cloud your judgment and acted rashly!" 
Ethan shot me a puzzled glance from where he stood. 
Chest heaving, I roared back, "This is about my ex-wife! I did what needed to be done!"  
"You're belittling Sarah..." Mariano huffed, his tone shifting. "That's the issue, Philip. Your decisions are driven by emotion." 
"I didn't spill the truth to Madam Olsen if that's what you're insinuating!" I reasoned.  
"Is that why you snatched the document containing the investigation on Sarah Mitchell from Madam Olsen?" Mariano's question hung in the air. "Philip, do you know why I chose you for my operation?" 
"What are you getting at?" 
"Because Sarah is under TerraTraxx's protection. She's Blaze Belle! I can't manipulate her because she doesn't need me! There's a formidable barrier shielding and safeguarding her, and that includes you!" 
I squeezed my eyes shut. Mariano's revelation hinted at Sarah being a skilled racer who seldom participated in tournaments, a suspicion I had previously entertained but failed to explore further. I'm such a blind idiot! 
"Now, I want you to encourage your ex-wife to enter the upcoming race," Mariano commanded. "But you must also ensure she doesn't win the competition. That's your penance for your transgressions tonight." 
Mariano abruptly ended the call, and a surge of irritation coursed through me. He intended to rope Sarah into his schemes, ensuring a hefty profit from my race. 
"Damn it!" I cursed. 
"What's going on?" Ethan queried, clearly displeased by my restless behavior. 
"It's about Sarah!" I responded. 
"No wonder you're acting like a madman who's had his manhood rudely severed!" 
With quivering hands, I hastily retrieved the envelope containing Sarah's files from beside my helmet and tore it open. 
Ethan and I spent the entire night scrutinizing the documents: a photocopy of Sarah's birth certificate, diploma, academic commendations, medical reports from Dubai and Highland Hills, her ties to the Benners, and her relationship with Bronn Martin. There was even a copy of her professional licenses for sanctioned races and events. She possessed a firearm license and certification of a black belt in judo. She had accomplished all of these remarkable achievements before we had even married! 
"Damn it!" I exclaimed. My mind was a whirlpool of confusion and disbelief as I tried to make sense of the information laid out before me, feeling like everything I thought I knew was just a fabricated illusion. 
"She's like a member of the CIA who hid her identity too well from you," Ethan said, his brow furrowed with concern. "Do you have any idea about the details in these reports?" 
I shook my head. "No! None of this makes any sense! All I know is someone wants to kill Sarah, which is why she's been studying all these things! But they're likely not real, right? She's been staying home for three damn years like a dumb, clueless housewife!" 
Ethan crossed his arms, his expression equally perplexed. "Are you absolutely certain? Have you monitored her every move at Serenity Pines for the past three years to make such definitive statements?" 
I pondered Sarah's personality carefully. She was always so gentle, so damn demure-the picture of simplicity. She couldn't even hold my gaze in the past, like a fragile, submissive wife! 
I don't even know what to think! 
Ethan interjected, "What if Sarah married you to hide her true purpose? It's clearly stated in this report that she's marrying Bronn Martin! What if Sarah is using you?" 
I hated that Ethan was stating the obvious! 
"I got jealous of Amir Benner, only to find out that Sarah is actually a member of the Benner family?"  
"Exactly!" Ethan nodded. "That's why I said she's like a CIA operative! We might be facing the surprising truth that Sarah is part of a secret spy group, and she's been looking into you because of your relationship with Mariano!" 
Shit! It's too absurd! I married Sarah long before Mariano's group even existed. 
My head was spinning, trying to make sense of it all. "I must talk to Sarah!" 
"Do you know where to find her?" Ethan inquired. 
That night, I discovered that Sarah had flown to Dubai. Nevertheless, I still bombarded her with messages, keeping up the charade of the annoying husband-though inside, wanting to strangle someone, anyone! Instead, I impulsively bought an Airbus H175 helicopter and 10 hectares of land in the remote northern region out of sheer frustration and desperation!  
I'll use them in business ventures, ensuring they don't go to waste. 
Then, as if the universe were taunting me further, I encountered Bronn Martin at the Dubai airport.  
"President Cornell, what a surprise to see you here! Why didn't you come with me to the Benner mansion? I know you came all this way for Sarah." 
I gave Bronn a sharp look but stayed silent and followed him. I didn't let my emotions show on the outside! Yet inwardly, I felt utterly stupid and played for a fool. 
When I finally arrived at the opulent Benner mansion and laid eyes on Sarah, that's when my ex-wife slapped me squarely across the face with the brutal, unvarnished truth!
###chapter 75: Naïve 
**Sarah** 

I was momentarily stunned into silence by the announcement of my unexpected visitors: Amir, Grandpa Mitchell, and a few helpers in the dining area were all staring at me. Seeing Philip's face was the last thing I wanted at that moment.  
He had lied to me and hurt me deeply! My friend Jakob warned me about him; letting Philip back into my life would only worsen things. He wasn't one to grant second chances at love, either. 
"What is that moron doing here?" Amir's accusatory tone cut through the air, aimed squarely at me. I grasped that he meant Philip. 
As much as I inwardly wondered the same thing, I replied, "I don't know." 
A troubling suspicion surfaced: could Philip have stumbled upon hints about my true identity and was now feigning ignorance, using it as a tactic to win me over again? 
Grandpa Mitchell's eyes narrowed in disapproval. "Ha! So your wretched ex-husband dares to come all the way here uninvited... You know better than to entertain his foolishness, Sarah. I expected resilience and wisdom from you as a Mitchell!" 
Grandpa Mitchell and Amir rose from their seats, determined to confront my two visitors loitering outside the mansion's entrance. 
I took a moment to sort through my thoughts, realizing how foolishly I'd behaved. I'd let Philip mistreat me in the past, and it looked like I was about to fall into the same trap again. I wasted my time with Philip, enabling his behavior as he continued to act without restraint.  
But no more! No more games, Sarah. 
Steeling my resolve, I went outside the mansion and saw Bronn, who greeted me with a wide, warm smile while Philip's jaw clenched tensely as our eyes met. 
"Sarah!" Bronn approached, planting a kiss on my cheek. 
"Why are you here?" I inquired of him. 
"I have a meeting with your grandfather," he replied. 
Suppressing the discomfort in my chest, I nodded. 
"Is this your ex-husband, Sarah?" Grandpa Mitchell directed his question at me before turning to Philip. "After you mistreated and disrespected my granddaughter like a ragdoll for three long years, why have you stupidly come here now, boy?" 
Unfazed by my grandfather's barb, Philip composed himself. "I've come to speak with your granddaughter, Sir." 
"Weren't the past few months of conversation sufficient? Reconciliation with my granddaughter seems unlikely. She's marrying Bronn Martin!" Grandpa Mitchell declared. 
Bronn stayed silent, his discomfort palpable, while Philip's eyes narrowed in response to Grandpa Mitchell's words. 
Undeterred, Grandpa Mitchell pressed on, "Do you believe you lack resources, young man? My Sarah deserves better than an incompetent person like yourself!"  
My grandfather's words resonated with truth. I gave Philip more time to seek redemption and mend things between us, even just a little. But deep down, my heart knew that he couldn't let go of his overbearing, manipulative mother. It proved Philip and I just weren't meant to be. Too much had happened, and it was too late to fix things between us. 
"Grandpa, please allow me a private conversation with my ex-husband. It's uncomfortable for Bronn," I requested. 
My grandfather let out a loud huff of displeasure, his brow furrowing, but he ultimately respected my wishes. Bronn flashed me a reassuring smile before gently guiding my grandfather by the elbow and leading him inside the opulent mansion. 
A palpable tension hung between Philip and me, but I refused to avert my gaze. I met his accusing eyes head-on. 
"So, this is the real you, is it? You've been lying to me this whole fucking time!" Philip's fist clenched in response to my grandfather's insult. 
His anger stoked mine. How dare he blame me when all I did was protect myself out of love? 
"What else have you kept from me? Besides completing your coursework online at Crestwood University? You're Blaze Belle, the Benner princess, and you're marrying Bronn Martin?!" His questions came rapid-fire, his voice escalating. 
"Why? Did discovering the truth about my background and family name severely bruise your ego? Is that it?" I retaliated. 
Philip's voice had an unmistakable tone of pain and anguish as he continued his tirade. 
"This is just great! My father used me as a pawn in business for years. I grew weary of seeking his approval, knowing deep down he'd never accept me into Luminary Productions because I am my mother's son. And my mother was no better-she manipulated me constantly, pushing me to do this, do that, micromanaging every aspect of my life until it practically drove me insane! But what could I do? She's my own mother! 
"You, Sarah, were the only person I believed was genuine in my life. And now I discover that it was all built on falsehoods? You played the role of a gentle, submissive wife so convincingly! Why did you play me for a fool and deceive me like this, Sarah?" 
Tears streamed down my cheeks, though I clenched my jaw in determination. "You have no right to interrogate me, Philip Cornell. Answer me this: did you ever love or love me now?" 
It was the second time I had asked Philip that question. For weeks, I had hoped that I would somehow find a place in his heart amidst our fleeting moments of happiness. 
His eyes narrowed, his anger palpable, the sense of betrayal emanating from him. "No, Sarah! I could never love a woman who only loves herself! Whatever existed between us was nothing more than lust!" 
His cruel words felt like a dagger plunging directly into my chest.  
"Why did I even bother to ask? You didn't love me then, so why would I think that would change now? Your family betrayed me when I was lying in that hospital, devastated and feeling like a lost soul... But you'll never understand that feeling because your privileged life continues" 
As angry tears poured down my face, I realized the harsh truth. 
"While you ascended to the presidency of Luminary Productions, I was left here, adrift, foundering without any direction or purpose! You betrayed me and abandoned me, Philip, when you chose to turn a blind eye to your mother's doing!" 
For weeks, I had clung to the naïve, faint hope that Philip would eventually come around and do the right thing for me and our unborn child, who was so cruelly taken from me! But it seemed impossible because he never truly loved me from the start. 
Philip stared back at me with that distant, empty expression in his eyes, a look I had become familiar with during our doomed marriage. 
*** 
**Philip**  

"Is this Philip Cornell? What on earth are you doing here in our mansion?" Amir's words shot out like a bullet. 
My gaze hardened at his accusation. "I need to speak with Sarah." 
"Sarah doesn't want anything to do with you anymore! She just confessed that she'll be accepting Bronn Martin's proposal because you've proven yourself to be nothing but a worthless piece of shit!" 
An angry fire burned within me, and I clenched my fists, wanting nothing more than to knock that sneer off Amir's face. But I knew better than to stoke the flames.  
Sarah is marrying Bronn Martin!  
"Do you think I'm unaware of your connection with Mariano? I haven't told Sarah about the deceitful games you've been playing, but you persist in dragging her into your mess! My sister has already sacrificed so much for you! Just leave her be!" With that final snarled command, Amir turned and stormed away. 
When I caught sight of their Grandpa Mitchell, his disdainful expression cut deep. I knew I had many mistakes and failures in my past, but they seemed to relish tearing me down further. 
This is unbearable! Their humiliation knows no bounds! I realize I am unworthy of Sarah. I've caused her nothing but pain. 
When she asked me if I loved her, the question confused me, leaving me flustered and uncertain of how to respond. What did "love" even mean if she's not happy? 
I vow to change, but I can only feel her anguish. I failed to shield Sarah because I recklessly made a pact with the devil. Letting her go, as much as it shattered my own heart into pieces, seemed the only choice I had left...
###chapter 76: Fragile Hope 
Sarah 

My bedroom remained cloaked in shadows, the darkness enveloping me like a comforting embrace as I sought solace within its confines-with only a faint light shining in from outside. I came here briefly to release the tears I've been holding back.  
Philip's words kept replaying in my mind: he never loved me, not in the past, not now. The realization cut deeper than any blade, even though a part of me already knew the truth.  
Yet I felt his heartbreak, which only added to my confusion. 
I felt so foolish! 
It felt like a second stabbing as if the initial wound had been reopened and salt poured mercilessly into the raw, exposed flesh. I couldn't breathe, my chest tightened, and my vision blurred from the pain.  
Nevertheless, I had to pull myself together, return to my original plans, and ensure Madam Cornell suffered! 
"Miss, are you alright?" Amanda asked worriedly as darkness engulfed me again. 
"I'm fine..." It's expected to be hurt again, right? This is my fault. I let myself fall into the trap a second time. But now that I know the truth, that there's no truth to the one-year extension in my life, I had a more precise and extended plan to bring down Madam Cornell and Megan. Their downfall would be my ultimate redemption. 
I took a deep breath to calm myself. 
"Mr. Bronn Martin wants to see you," Amanda muttered. 
I stood up from my seat by the window. "Please prepare my bath. I'll meet with Bronn briefly." 
I promised to give Bronn Martin some time to get to know him. Now is that opportunity. 
After making sure there were no traces of tears in my eyes, I faced Bronn, who was waiting for me in the garden area. He sat casually, his bodyguard nearby. The sky held a faint light from the moon, casting an ethereal glow over the surroundings, while small fluorescent lights were scattered around the garden area, guiding my path. 
"Hi," I greeted him with a smile. 
"Your grandfather was right. The mansion is indeed promising during the night," he commented. 
Bronn discreetly signaled to his burly bodyguard to step back, allowing us to have a private conversation. 
"Are you okay? Sorry for bringing President Cornell along earlier. Given how strict the village is, he might not be allowed in. At least the security outside already knows my plate number as a regular visitor to your mansion." 
"It's fine," I replied casually. It was also good for Philip to see what I have. I continued to explain my plan to him. "Anyway, thanks for waiting for me. I also wanted to talk to you about the representative of BM Technologies at Luminary Production" 
"Jakob already informed me that we must replace you in that role. From that alone, I figured things didn't go well between you and President Cornell Uh, sorry for being nosy," he apologized. 
I offered a faint smile, bracing myself for the inevitable question. "Bronn, please don't take this the wrong way, but why exactly do you want to marry me?" 
The query clearly caught him off guard. He hadn't anticipated such a direct inquiry. Nevertheless, he answered honestly. "Because you are Sarah Benner. You wouldn't think I want to marry you because I love you, right? I'd be an ass to lie, Sarah I'm doing this out of a sense of responsibility. Back then, I never allowed myself the opportunity to get to know you better truly, but you're a woman now, Sarah." 
Bronn was right. It would be naïve, even arrogant, of me to assume he had spontaneously developed romantic feelings, especially considering our limited interactions in the past. He's not much older than Philip, so it wouldn't be surprising if he thought I was too young before. I only saw him visiting the mansion to meet with Grandpa Mitchell to discuss some matters. He exuded an aura of maturity while I was still a carefree student in my final year of high school. 
Maintaining steady eye contact, I proposed, "Then let's give each other a chance, Bronn. I ended things with Philip today because I wanted to explore the possibility of a romance with you. D-do you find me stupid or impulsive for making that decision?" 
"I will refrain from prying into what transpired between you and him. He's part of your past and no longer relevant at this point. I appreciate your honesty, and you can expect the same from me. It's a fair arrangement for both of us." 
That was when I realized I knew very little about Bronn's romantic history. In fact, I could not recall a single instance where he had even casually mentioned being in a relationship or dating someone seriously. His personal life in that regard was a complete mystery to me. 
Our discussion shifted to LoveLogic and the person they would assign for ChronoGrafix in Luminary Production. 
"Jakob will search for the most qualified candidates. Luminary should understand if we pull you from the project since you weren't part of the original contract. Any decisions surrounding the project ultimately lie between myself and President Cornell," Bronn explained. 
"Thanks for your help!" 
"Think nothing of it, Sarah!" 
"Anyway, I'll be busy in the coming days. Just let me know if you encounter any issues with Luminary Production. As for the non-player character in LoveLogic-your character-I'll handle the design for now, but I might find someone else to take over soon." 
Our conversation continued smoothly for the next few hours until he said goodbye. 
Before I went to sleep, I received a call from Jane. It was decided-she was set to marry Mr. Olsens, who has two bratty children, and I couldn't do anything about it since I was just a friend and an observer. The marriage agreement was a matter between their families. 
During the following days at the mansion, I focused on gathering information about financial strategies. My grandfather then revealed the substantial profits and incentives I had accumulated from various companies. 
As he guided me through the bank account statements, I was overcome with disbelief at the staggering figure displayed-several billion dollars. 
"Grandpa, w-why do I have so much money?" I asked. 
"Because a considerable portion originated from the stocks and shares bequeathed to you by your mother upon her passing. Those assets remain under your name to this day," he clarified. 
"But you were the one who arranged and took care of it... I-I don't know if I can accept it... How about you or Amir?" 
"Don't worry about your brother. Amir is doing well in your dad's company." Grandpa Mitchell reassured me with a dismissive gesture. 
With the significant funds from my inheritance, I realized I had more than enough money to support the ambitious LoveLogic project fully. 
"Now, don't let me down, Sarah. You'll be representing yourself from now on." 
I nodded.  
While Grandpa Mitchell continued discussing some matters with me, my phone rang. Upon glimpsing the screen, I noted that the incoming call originated from an unfamiliar number, prompting me to ignore it and swiftly switch the device to silent mode. After my session with Grandpa Mitchell, I saw three more missed calls from the same number. There was also a message. 
***Anonymous number:*** *Madam Sarah, this is Trey. I apologize for disturbing you with my calls. I watched over Miss Jane here at Mr. Benner's mansion. But I regret to inform you that we have been compelled to send Miss Jane to the hospital because we found her with cuts on her wrists. It appears she has made an attempt to take her own life tragically, Madam Sarah...* 
I trembled uncontrollably as the weight of those words sank in. Hastily, I checked the calendar to confirm the date. Tomorrow was supposed to be the day of Jane's wedding to the Olsens. It became clear that the thought of being forced into a loveless marriage had driven her to the absolutely unthinkable as her only perceived way out. 
Without a moment's delay, I began packing my belongings and told Grandpa Mitchell I needed to return to Highland Hills immediately.
###chapter 77: Clashing Tongues 
**Sarah** 

The chill of the early morning air greeted us as we pulled into Highland Hills. True to my word, I had brought Amanda along and another helper named Pepper to handle my increasingly demanding workload.  
Amir's villa was locked up tight, but he had spare keys as the owner. Once inside, I instructed Amanda and Pepper to take some time to rest and recover from our long journey. Amir had cut short his vacation because Assistant Reynolds had an accident, and he was now in the process of finding someone new to fill that role.  
Amir frowned as he accompanied me toward the guest room I had temporarily provided for my friend Jane to use. 
"Did you let your friend stay here?" Amir remarked, his tone making it clear he was not pleased about this. 
"Yes," I replied. 
"It looks like they cleaned the villa. I have to ensure nothing's missing and they didn't tamper with the security system." 
I rolled my eyes at him. "I trust those people, Amir! I added a security system here in the villa if that's what you think." 
"You touched my security setup? Without clearing it with me first?" He couldn't believe it, his eyes widening. 
Putting on an innocent look, I avoided direct eye contact as I responded, "Come on! I didn't mess with the original villa security measures. I enhanced them a bit further." 
"Yeah, right! Your gestures say you're lying! Anyway, I'll come with you to the hospital," he commented. 
I shrugged. I knew Amir wanted to see for himself if it was confirmed that our mom had an identical twin. After all, he had known our mother far better than I had. 
Amir continued, "Do you have any further updates about your friend's condition?" 
"I texted Trey. He's the one who called me and the person assigned to guard Jane at the hospital, making sure no media can get through. The latest update is that my friend regained consciousness, but they couldn't communicate with her properly. Chairman Cornell is on a trip from China, and I'm still determining his comment about Jane's action.  
"I'm sure the outcome won't be good, especially with some people already gossiping about what happened. I told Jakob to ensure that no news about Jane gets published online. He's still on guard." 
Amir just shook his head. "You keep getting in trouble!" 
After quickly changing into more casual clothes, we headed out. The driver took us straight to the General Hospital, and light was starting to appear on the eastern horizon as we arrived. 
In a few moments, we reached the end of the hallway where Jane's ward was. Even from the hallway, it was clear that chaos reigned, with numerous security personnel guarding her room.  
"I think the Olsen family has arrived. Chairman Cornell may also be present," I remarked to Amir, surveying the commotion. 
"Madam Sarah!" a familiar voice called out as we approached the hallway's corner.  
I was surprised to see Josh and immediately recalled that he was Megan's ex. Swiftly composing myself, I acted with casual nonchalance, well aware that he must not know of my knowledge regarding his true identity. 
"Josh, what is happening? I just got back from a business trip. Trey informed me about Jane. But what precisely is unfolding in my friend's ward? Why are there so many people present?" 
"Madam Sarah, first of all, Boss Philip instructed me to watch for your arrival. He also ordered Trey to message you." 
My lips tightened as I realized why I hadn't heard from Philip. Usually, he would constantly call and message me. My throat tightened as my eyes narrowed. 
"What is happening?" I demanded. 
"Mr. Olsen arrived with his mother to discuss their agreed-upon contract. Currently, Miss Jane remains unresponsive and has not spoken a word. That's all I know," Josh explained. 
I reached out and grasped Josh's hand, pleading, "Can you please ensure Jane overcomes whatever depression she's facing right now?" 
Josh nodded. 
"Well, well... aren't these Ms. Mitchell and Mr. Benner?" I hadn't even noticed that Madam Olsen had already approached us, together with several individuals. 
"I'll go ahead, Mother! I have a meeting to attend!" declared the man with an imposing, bulky physique. This was undoubtedly the man Jane had been set to marry. 
After Grandpa Mitchell revealed this woman's real, unpleasant side-the reason Marcus was in our lives-it made sense that I didn't think highly of her. 
"I would have liked to say, 'It's nice seeing you, Madam Olsen,' but such words would go against my true feelings, and it's simply wrong to tell lies," I said. 
"So, is that why you choose to hide like your true nature?" she retorted with a disdainful sneer. 
I responded with sharply biting words, my voice edging like a blade, "That's better than betraying one's flesh and blood, stealing wealth from one's father. The most despicable, immoral act is stealing someone else's identity."  I smiled blandly, taunting her. 
Amir chimed in, "It's fortunate that people's characters can't be photocopied. The Benners see right through you because your bad behavior stinks. Shall we start calling you Aunt Marietta?" 
"Calling her 'Madam Olsen' is sufficient," I corrected Amir. "Since Grandpa already forgets her, we don't want to foster any false sense of familiarity. We'll treat her like the stranger she is to Grandpa Mitchell." 
I could tell my comment stung her deeply. From the story Grandpa Mitchell shared, it was clear this woman was envious of our kind-hearted mother, whom Grandpa looked after. Madam Olsen visibly tensed, her jaw tightening with teeth grinding together. 
In a casual tone, she said, "You're such a bitch, Ms. Mitchell. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised why your in-laws despise you..." She paused, feigning an oops moment. "Oh, but I forgot, even your husband doesn't love you. Not even your dad can stand you." 
If Madam Olsen had uttered those words to me before, those scathing words would have sliced my heart deeply, but I've already shed tears twice. At this point, I've come to accept the harsh reality. Indulging in self-pity gained me nothing. 
I chose to stay silent, refusing to grant her the satisfaction of a response as she strode past me, purposefully knocking into my shoulder with hers. Amir shook his head. 
Before I could muster any further reaction, Madam Cornell strode down the hallway, followed by Philip, who cast me a deep, penetrating glance, and Chairman Cornell himself. 
My heart felt awful at the sight of him, but I pushed away any feelings I had for him, putting on a blank face to shield myself. 
"And you came here just to spread gossip! You're the vile one who encouraged Jane to do this unthinkable thing! You're a murderer!" accused Philip's mother. 
"Mother!" Philip admonished her. 
"Madam Cornell, what an... interesting choice of words," I responded, trying to stay calm and not fall into her trap. "So bold that your tongue seems to have turned black from your audacity!" I raised an eyebrow, curious. "Aren't you even a bit disturbed by how quickly you jumped to calling me a killer?" 
She clenched her teeth before turning to Amir. "Mr. Benner, that woman is despicable! She's manipulating men like you. She's doing to you what she did to my son!" 
Amir swiftly addressed the accusation directed at my ex-father-in-law. "Chairman Cornell, it appears your wife may have misplaced her manners back at your mansion. She chose an ill-suited moment in this very hospital corridor, with countless strangers walking around and unwittingly bearing witness." 
His words stung the Chairman, a man known for fiercely guarding his impeccable reputation above all else. Chairman Cornell's eyes narrowed into slits as he shot his wife a withering glare-an unmistakable warning. 
Madam Cornell visibly recoiled. 
"Indeed, President Cornell, I respectfully suggest you consider relocating your mother, perhaps to a destination as distant as the moon. She seems to speak nonsense that no reasonable man could ever hope to comprehend." 
"This bitch!" Madam Cornell erupted, her face contorted with rage, but her husband swiftly raised his hand and delivered a resounding slap across her cheek.  
"I warned you to cease!" 
Philip's fist tightened as if this behavior were routine for his father. 
With a huff, Chairman Cornell stormed away. 
"Honey, wait..." Madam Cornell's voice rang out plaintively, and tears streamed down her reddened cheeks. Philip's jaw clenched tightly as he followed his parents. 
Philip's actions leave me utterly stunned. But there is a better moment for inquiries. 
'There's no time for emotions, Sarah'  
Turning to Josh, I refocused. "I need your help locating a certain Dr. Smith, an OB-GYN working at this hospital last year." 
"Hmm...I believe Boss Philip is also searching for that woman," Josh responded thoughtfully. 
"Philip?" I repeated, puzzled. I had no idea what machinations my ex-husband could have in mind concerning this Dr. Smith. A slight feeling of worry crept over me. "Can you try obtaining a photo of Dr. Smith for me?" 
"I'll do my best." 
"Thank you." 
Having accomplished his purpose here, Amir also took his leave, though he left one of his trusted guards behind to stay with me. As I stepped into Jane's ward, that's when I learned the full extent of everything that had transpired
###chapter 78: Tangled Webs 
**Sarah** 

When I entered the hospital ward, Jane was leaning against the upright bed, quietly sobbing. 
"Jane!" I called out, my voice tinged with worry. 
"S-Sarah" She looked up and saw me, a glimmer of relief in her eyes. I approached the side of her bed so she could hug me properly. She clung to me tightly, crying softly like a child. 
"Why did you do that, Jane? Why did you try to cut your wrist?" I couldn't help but ask. 
She answered in a frail voice with only the two of us in the room. "It's a ploy, Sarah I made sure I wouldn't die." 
"What?" Confusion furrowed my brow as I studied the bandage on her hand, noticing the cut was far from her wrist. "What the hell, Jane! What you did was incredibly dangerous!" 
She continued weeping as she told her story. "I know! But what can I do? I can no longer take it! I have to ensure I won't marry Mr. Olsen!" 
"Does anyone know?" 
Shaking her head, she replied, "If you're wondering if Brother Philip knows, I only told you Oh Sarah, if you could have seen how terrified I was when Dad arrived earlier! He wanted to beat me, but Brother Philip shielded me from his rage..." Her tears streaked down her pale cheeks. 
It was good that Philip could protect her, even as my heart clenched just at the mere thought of him.  
"But why are you still crying?" 
Jane went on, "I never imagined that the Olsens and my family had already made a contract behind my back. The Olsens are major financial backers of Philip's SciFi project, and they threatened to withdraw a huge amount of money if I didn't marry into the Olsen family." 
My eyes widened in horror as she continued her explanation. 
"I pleaded with Brother Philip last night not to give me to the Olsens. Earlier, after he realized how far I was willing to go to escape the marriage, he agreed to shoulder the damages Madam Olsen demanded It's millions of dollars, Sarah, and my brother agreed to bankrupt himself to ensure that my marriage to them wouldn't go through." 
Finally, Philip did what he had to do! 
"But that's not the end of it, Sarah... My dad decided to remove me from the project entirely! He's also cutting off my allowance and revoking all my cards. That's my punishment for what I did. I-it's fine. That's why I'm jobless right now and penniless..." she sobbed. 
I felt at a loss, unsure what to say. Chairman Cornell's punishment was reasonable, given Jane's rash actions. Suddenly, Remembering a potential lifeline, I realized I needed LoveLogic's assistance. 
"That's right! You've got a job, Jane. You're familiar with my ties to BM Technologies. Jakob, a friend and collaborator-he's looking for people to help us design a non-player character. Basically, an AI that can serve as a technically 'imaginary boyfriend' for the user." 
I proceeded to explain the concept of LoveLogic to her, the virtual romance companion that could provide emotional support and intimacy tailored to the individual. As I spoke, I could see Jane's tentative spark of interest. 
Little did I know, this would soon become a pressing issue in our friendship 
*** 
I had a couple of business meetings scheduled at Aspire Financial Group, a prominent financial services company headquartered in Highland Hills. Therefore, I had to remain in town while Amir returned to his job, and he kindly arranged for an assistant for me. 
While Jane and I waited for Bronn at the hotel restaurant, I sent Jakob a message: I have a task for you. 
Jakob's response came swiftly, laden with sarcasm: Oh, God! I thought I was done being your slave. What is it this time?  
This brute! 
I chuckled at his dramatics before typing: Come on! Please investigate Emily Carter for me. She's the assistant working at Aspire Financial Group. 
I wanted to ensure that the assistant Amir gave me wasn't as difficult as some of the women around me. I'm not looking for another Madam Cornell, Megan, or Jessica Woods... Please, not again! 
Jakob immediately replied: Are you sure about the name? 
I confirmed: That's the name Amir gave me.  
With no immediate follow-up from Jakob, I decided to let the matter be for the moment. Just in time, Bronn arrived. 
"Sarah!" Bronn greeted as he approached. 
"Oh, hi! Thank you!" I stood and gave him a friendly peck on the cheek, accepting the bouquet he offered. "By the way, this is Jane Cornell. She's now part of Jakob's team. They haven't crossed paths since Jakob was still busy in Henderson, though they've had brief interactions in the past since we all came from Crestwood." 
Jane's cheeks visibly reddened a bit as she made eye contact with the tall, handsome Bronn. 
"Jane will be the one designing your non-player character for the LoveLogic, which is why I arranged this meeting today," I explained. 
"I see" Bronn seemed distracted, prompting my inquiry. 
"Is everything alright?" I asked, concerned. 
"Nothing! I'm sorry, some other matters weighing on my mind," he reassured me, though his distraction was palpable. 
From how he seemed, I figured he was probably dealing with some tough business stuff. But I didn't ask more since giving business advice wasn't my thing. 
While they chatted about design ideas, Jane snapped pictures of Bronn with her camera. I politely left to use the restroom while they were busy. 
As I washed my hands, the restroom door suddenly swung open, revealing Philip standing there, his eyes holding an intensity I couldn't ignore. Before I could react, he swiftly locked the door behind him and closed the distance between us. In one fluid motion, he pulled me into a forceful embrace, holding me tightly against him as his lips crashed onto mine in a passionate, longing kiss.  
I was stunned, unable to move, though part of me wanted to push him away. There was an aching desire mixed with undeniable pain etched across his expression. 
"Please..." Philip uttered in a hurtful tone after breaking the kiss. "I can't, Sarah..." 
'What does that even mean?' 
Before I could process his words, he had already turned and hastily exited the ladies' room, vanishing from sight as quickly as he had appeared like the bogeyman in a dream. 
My mouth hung open in shock. In those fleeting seconds, I was utterly bewildered, unable to comprehend what had just occurred.

**Bronn** 

Just like all the other powerful men in this ruthless fucking business world, I did whatever was necessary to further my interests and ambitions, carrying the empire initially built by my grandfather. 
My encounter with Sarah dates back to when she was just sixteen. At that time, I saw her as too young for any romantic involvement. It was then that I met Emily Carter, who became my secret mistress for two years. Our relationship was completely hidden from others-Emily was like an intangible dream, unreal and ever-elusive. 
The moment I was on the brink of marrying Sarah four years ago, Emily vanished into the shadows, evaporating like a wisp of smoke in the night. However, Sarah herself tied the knot with Philip Cornell simultaneously. 
I had no clue of Emily's whereabouts after her disappearance, and I convinced myself that letting her go was ultimately for the best. 
During my recent encounter with Sarah, she proposed an embrace of honesty between us. We agreed to give our relationship a chance, a decision I deemed the most sensible. Yet, just before meeting Sarah at a hotel in Highland Hills, a message from Jakob interrupted. 
***Jakob:*** *Brother, I found Emily! But now things are tricky. Emily Carter works at Aspire Financial Group, and she's assigned as Sarah's personal assistant.* 
The news sent shivers down my spine. After four years without so much as a whisper about this woman, Emily resurfaced under Sarah's wing. Another message arrived from Jakob. 
***Jakob:*** *Sarah tasked me with investigating Emily's background. What am I supposed to tell her?* 
I felt utterly lost and confused. What should I tell Sarah first? Should I confess my family connection to Jakob, which explains how I know her whereabouts? Or should I come clean about the deeply personal secret of my past passionate affair with her future assistant, Emily? 
Emily was a relationship I had desperately tried to convince myself was firmly in the past, or so I had thought
###chapter 79: Unrelenting Burden 
**Philip**  

As I sat on the hotel's third floor, engaged in a meeting and enjoying a cup of coffee, my attention was drawn to Sarah and Jane, visible through the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. Positioned in the open-air restaurant nestled within the garden below, I had a clear line of sight of my ex-wife. 
Moments later, Bronn Martin appeared, clutching a bouquet. Witnessing Sarah accept the floral gesture with evident delight, I couldn't help but clench my jaw. 
"President Cornell?" The private investigator I had hired pulled me from my reverie. 
"Boss?" echoed Alex, detecting my distraction. 
Snapping back to attention, I turned to face them. "My apologies. What were you saying?" 
Clearing his throat, the investigator continued, "Here are the files you requested. According to my sources, Madam Cornell and Dr. Smith have known each other for over two decades. They hail from the same hometown." 
I reached out and accepted the thick envelope containing the compiled information. 
"And where is Dr. Smith now?" I inquired. 
"All the information regarding Dr. Smith is enclosed in that file: her educational background, family details, properties, and her current whereabouts, President Cornell," the investigator explained. 
"Thank you!"  
"But, President Cornell, I must caution you. There may be details in the report that you find displeasing," he warned. 
"I can handle it," I assured him. 
What else could be more upsetting than knowing they were involved in Sarah's miscarriage? 
As the investigator departed, I could not muster the will to review the files. My thoughts were consumed by Sarah, who lingered downstairs. I couldn't shake the ache in my heart. I felt Alex's sympathetic gaze, silently recognizing the pain I was going through as he also looked in her direction. 
"Boss, why are you letting Madam Sarah's distress escalate? Have you decided to let her be with Mr. Martin?" Alex inquired. 
"Sarah is not going to marry Bronn Martin," I stated plainly. I knew Alex wouldn't fully grasp my intentions. However, deep within me, I solemnly vowed that Sarah would never, under any circumstances, be with that man.  
I felt a profound sense of vulnerability, which is why I'm allowing her to slip away. The weight of my inadequacy burdens me. I yearned to be a man of greater wealth and strength, to protect her from harm. 
My mother's actions had put Sarah in grave danger. During my trip to Dubai, I uncovered her sinister plot involving a doctor swiftly escorted out of Mr. Mitchell's mansion by security.  
The weight of guilt was suffocating. Everything Sarah had experienced, every ounce of pain inflicted upon her, ultimately traced back to my own failings.  
Discovering Sarah's true identity as a Benner had initially stung, but it paled compared to the horrors she had faced. I knew she would continue to suffer, which is why I had to deceive Mother into believing I had severed ties with Sarah. 
Lost in my thoughts, I was jolted back to reality when Sarah excused herself from Bronn and Jane. I followed her to the ladies' room, overwhelmed by a sudden surge of emotion. I could no longer restrain myself!  
I had to kiss her caress her feel her! 
That kiss ignited a fire within me, momentarily easing the burden of my worries.  
As I reviewed the files the investigator prepared, it hit me hard: he was right!  
The awful things my mother did were laid out in front of me, and it was too much to handle. Every piece of information about the evil deeds my mother had committed was nauseating. 
*** 
**Sarah**  

The afternoon, just after my meeting with Bronn, I made my way to Aspire Financial Group, an exclusive association of wealthy financial investors.  Even from the opulent marble lobby, the lavish interior decor caught my eye immediately. Security was extremely tight, requiring identification before accessing the elevators.  
I walked up to the rounded front desk made of polished mahogany, where a smartly dressed man and two neatly groomed women were stationed.  
"Hi, I'm Sarah Mitchell. I'm here for a meeting-" 
Before I could finish, a familiar voice cut in. "Well, well Isn't this the bitch Sarah Mitchell?" 
Madam Cornell obviously just concluded some meeting of her own and wasted no time launching accusations.  
"Trying to seduce another wealthy man with your sleazy tricks?" she loudly accused, clearly trying to make a scene. 
Ignoring her, I persisted with the receptionist. "As I was saying-" 
"Don't believe a word she says. This shameless gold-digger is simply here to entrap and seduce wealthy men, just like all those other escort girls," Madam Cornell cut me once more. 
It seemed the staff was swayed by Madam Cornell's words. It's unfortunate, but Philip's mother was right that there have been incidents of escorts and sugar babies managing to slip through security to prowl for billionaire prey here. 
"Miss, I'm here on business, with a meeting in five minutes. Could you please call my assistant-" 
Madam Cornell laughed. "Tsk tsk tsk... Nice try, Sarah," pulling out her fancy checkbook and pen. With a smirk, she wrote out a check for $5, waving it at me. "Here's your taxi fare. This place isn't for the likes of you Shooo!" She flicked her crimson-lacquered nails in a dismissive shoo-ing motion.  
I struggled to maintain my composure, but her provocation was testing my limits. If only murder were legal, I would have been tempted to throttle her.  
The receptionist intervened, maintaining professionalism. "Ma'am, who are you scheduled to meet with?" 
Ignoring Madam Cornell's antics, I affirmed, "I have a meeting with Mr. Johnson, the association's president." 
The receptionist typed into her computer and then looked up at me. "So you're part of the afternoon executive meeting in the Manhattan Boardroom?" she clarified. 
"That's right!" 
"Isn't it standard procedure for investors to carry identification?" the receptionist said sternly, giving me a questioning look as to why I did not have my ID ready. 
"That's precisely why I'm reaching out to you for assistance." Frustration tinged my voice. "My meeting starts in five minutes, and I should already be inside. I assume my assistant has taken care of my security IDs. However, it's my first day, and I only know her name. I was instructed to contact her, but unfortunately, I do not yet have her phone number." 
"Sarah, that's quite a story you've got there! Maybe those drugs you took are still messing with your head," Madam Cornell said, looking at the receptionist. "I think she's trying to pull a scam." 
I gritted my teeth hard as Madam Cornell's words brought back painful memories of how unfairly she and the doctor treated me. Philip's mother was purposely trying to anger me, pushing me to my limit.  If she kept it up, I might end up in jail for murder. 
"One more word, woman! And you won't be welcome in Highland Hills any longer!" I warned, narrowing my eyes at Madam Cornell before redirecting my attention to the receptionist. "Call my assistant now, or I'll ensure you're escorted out of this town just like she will be!" 
To my dismay, things went really bad. The three receptionists deemed my behavior unhinged and threatening. They promptly called building security, who firmly escorted me out! 
Madam Cornell shook her head, strolling smugly over to her expensive luxury car. 
"Ugh!" 
"Madam Sarah!" My two bodyguards, who had remained stationed in our vehicle as they were prohibited from entering, rushed over upon witnessing the incident play out. "What happened?" 
"Call your boss Amir immediately, and instruct him to contact Emily Carter to bring my security ID down here!" 
Consumed by utter annoyance, I impulsively called Philip's number. "Could you please send your mother away... anywhere? To the moon or wherever! Because if she keeps this up, I'll end up in jail for murdering her!" 
"I miss you..." were the gentle words Philip uttered, calming the storm of frustration inside me. I fell silent, feeling embarrassed by my outburst, my cheeks turning red. 
I hastily ended the call. I should not have called him. Damn it! 
Shortly after, Emily, a tall, elegant woman adorned in a figure-hugging pencil skirt, emerged from the building, but she's not alone... The president also came down, likely getting scolded by my grandfather.
###chapter 80: Rocky Start 
**Sarah**  

"Hi, Ms. Mitchell!" the woman greeted me, her voice tinged with relief and a hint of embarrassment. She was a brunette with intelligent hazel eyes, probably older than me by a couple of years, dressed in a crisp navy blazer and matching pencil skirt. "I'm really sorry. Here's your identification," she added, handing me the sleek, laminated card. 
"Thank God! You're here!" I approached her and introduced myself. "I'm Sarah Mitchell. Just call me Sarah." 
" Emily!" We shook hands. I should have waited for you in the lobby to prevent any problems. I'm genuinely sorry for the inconvenience." 
We entered the building together. The three receptionists stood at their posts, avoiding eye contact with Mr. Johnson. The president glanced at me while the three widened their eyes, clearly terrified. 
"President Johnson," I said with a frown as I approached. 
"Ms. Mitchell!" 
"President Johnson, I believe it's time to reconsider your staffing choices in this lobby," I stated. 
"M-Ms. Mitchell! Please!" the woman who had me escorted out pleaded "I-I'm renting a space, and I can't afford to lose my job. I have a family to support. Please find it in your heart to forgive me! I need this job desperately." 
I grimaced, feeling my resolve waver, and then exhaled. "Fine! Write me an apology letter on five sheets of paper-handwritten. I want it on my desk after my meeting!" 
I followed Mr. Johnson to the elevator, with Emily close behind. Inside, the older man apologized again. 
"The truth is, I don't give my staff second chances. In my experience, mistakes in business can be costly. I don't tolerate them. I'm surprised you're more lenient than me. Don't let this happen in business, Sarah," he advised. 
"It's also my fault for letting my annoyance get the best of me. Madam Cornell is my ex-monster-in-law, and she pushed all my buttons earlier. I didn't keep my cool, and I'm partly to blame. The staff were doing their job. Security is tight, and without my ID, I must have seemed like a crazed intruder!" 
Mr. Johnson laughed. Emily, however, remained serious, her eyes darting between us with keen interest. 
"It seems you have a deep relationship with Madam Cornell," he commented. 
Very deep, I thought, but I kept that to myself. 
"If you don't mind me inquiring, what brings Madam Cornell here? Is she part of your organization?" I asked. 
"No, she's not. She's close to one of the investors here, if you know what I mean," he said with a meaningful smile. I couldn't ask more because the elevator opened, and he exited first. 
Hmmm does this mean Madam Cornell is cheating? 
*** 
"Good afternoon! I'm Sarah Mitchell, the newest member of the group and probably the youngest," I announced, introducing myself to everyone at the meeting. 
"How old are you, Miss Mitchell?" One man leaned forward. 
"I'm turning twenty-three," I replied. 
A ripple of murmurs circulated the room.  
"So young"  
"Inexperienced"  
"Her family must be..." 
But in this world, age isn't what matters-money is. They won't get anything from me because I will manage all my investments. 
However, I wasn't naïve. My youth and perceived vulnerability made me a prime target. By the end of the day, I had no less than five suitors! Various sons of various magnates were introduced to me.  
I shook my head in disbelief. This was precisely why I guarded my true identity; people's true colors always come out. 
Despite this, I developed a good relationship with Emily over the next few hours. 
Later, as I reviewed a three-month financial report from a particular company, Emily exclaimed beside me, "Miss, y-you are that 'Miss Benner'?" she stammered, her fingers trembling slightly as they gripped the paper I had just signed. 
"Yes. Is there a problem?" I asked. 
She swallowed before answering, "N-No, nothing at all." 
I ignored her and went back to my work. 
The next day, I was busy when Emily handed me the schedule for several meetings I needed to attend the following week.  
Soon after, she cleared her throat. "M-Ms. Mitchell, I-I'm resigning as your assistant." 
My eyes widened in surprise. "What do you mean? And Emily, didn't I tell you to call me Sarah?" 
I was more than flustered; I was downright confused.  In the demanding world of corporate assistants, Emily was a gem. I hadn't noticed any issues with her. In fact, she worked well. How could my assistant be resigning on my second day on the job? 
"Do I have bad breath?" I asked. 
She was speechless. "N-No, Sarah." 
"Oh! Is it because I gave you too much workload? I'm really sorry; I'm still figuring things out. I've been focused on decision-making and didn't notice some things." I sighed, slumping back in my leather chair.  
"That's not the reason... I... I didn't know you were Mr. Benner's sister," she briefly explained. 
Her words hit me like a slap. I stared at her, my mind racing. It wasn't surprising since hardly anyone knew I was Amir's sister after our father removed me from our family tree.  
"Did you have a relationship with Amir?" I asked. 
She turned pale and trembled. Hmmm... my suspicion seems correct. 
I smiled widely. Maybe she's just too embarrassed to admit it to me. If anything, I preferred Emily as Amir's love interest than Jessica Woods with that woman's overly enhanced cheeks. 
"Look," I continued, "I'll give you a substantial bonus if you stay and keep up the great work." A few thousand dollars was a small price for peace of mind and a trustworthy assistant. 
I could tell she was uncomfortable. "Uhm..." 
"Please take some time to consider it. I'm willing to let you use my car as well." It was a reasonable offer, especially considering how much I needed her help.  
After a moment of silence, she finally relented, "Fine... I'll think about it!"  
"Thank you!" I replied gratefully. 
As I thought about things, my mind wandered to Jane, who was happily working on her project. Designing characters for an app can be challenging, but it's also rewarding. 
Upon returning to Amir's villa, I met an unexpected visitor-Josh. I recalled assigning him a task, but his sour expression caught me off guard. What could be bothering him? 
"After scouring several hospitals and contacting acquaintances of Dr. Smith, I managed to obtain her picture," Josh informed me. "But it seems Boss Philip is already on the case." 
"Where's Philip, anyway? I haven't sensed his presence for days-not that I'm actively seeking him out." My voice trailed off, and I was aware of how my words might sound. 
"He's taken Madam Cornell on vacation to the same island where Dr. Smith is currently located. I believe he intends to confront the two ladies personally," Josh explained. 
"I still need Dr. Smith's picture," I insisted, eager to find out the doctor's whereabouts. 
"Why?" Josh exploded, his composure finally shattering. "So, you can monitor his every move? Or maybe you want to dig into his background, uncover every little secret!" His voice rose with each question. "What the fuck, Sarah?!" 
Josh erupted, startling me. His lack of formality, addressing me without my title, made it feel like a stern rebuke from a teacher to a student. 
The guards, always watchful, quickly turned towards us. To them, Josh was an unknown individual, possibly a danger to my safety. 
"What's the matter?" I queried. "Why the sudden anger?" 
"What did you do with my photo?! The one you snapped at the bar out of nowhere? What did you discover?!" His eyes blazed with anger, but what struck me even more was the hurt etched across his face. His lower lip quivered like he was on the verge of tears. 
"At first, it seemed like just a casual request. But now... now I understand. It's the same reason you want Dr. Smith's picture, isn't it? What did you discover about me?!" Despite his towering frame and the raw emotion emanating from him, I didn't feel physically threatened  
I don't have a choice but to tell him the truth.
###chapter 81: Past Painted Black 
Sarah   
"Let's go inside," I urged Josh.  
Josh's jaw clenched, the muscles tightening under his tanned skin. His eyes, usually a warm hazel, now darkened with a mix of anger, frustration, and something deeper and more complex. Despite his agitation, I didn't feel threatened. There was an odd sense of safety in his presence, contradicting how he appeared. After a moment's hesitation, he unclenched his hands and followed me in. 
"Everything alright, Sarah?" Jane asked. "Hi, Josh!"  
I guided him through the spacious living room to the dining area. I placed the water before him, hoping the cool drink would help calm his nerves. He needed to relax.  
"Talk!" he demanded.  
"Ms. Sarah, is everything okay here?" the guard asked, still uneasy with Josh after seeing him shout at me earlier.  
"No problem at all. Please wait outside. We need to discuss something privately," I requested of the guard, assuring him I was safe.    
The man complied. "I'll be just outside."  
I looked back at Josh, who was also looking at me. I spoke in a slow, lower voice, "I'm sorry I had to understand why you're hiding your identity. With so many people wanting me dead, I can't afford to be careless."  
"So, what did you discover about me?" His tone was still sharp.  
"Not everything, trust me I-I learned your real name is Daniel Caldwell, and you're the man Megan ran away with."  
His face soured. He squinted at me. "And knowing my connection to her doesn't frighten you?"  
I countered with a question, holding his gaze. "Should I be afraid of you? Josh, if it weren't for you, I might still be wallowing in despair over a nonexistent illness! You helped me see the truth. Honestly, I haven't been able to think clearly. I thought I was dying, and that belief tainted every decision I made."  
"Then why did you investigate me?" His hand slammed down on the table.   
"Like I said, I have to be careful"  
"But I warned you it's better that you don't know anything!"  
"Well, that's what made me curious. Why did you say that? It's like waving a red flag in front of a bull. You had to know I'd be curious" I pouted, turning the blame back on him.  
He looked incredulous. "You're unbelievable!"  
"I'm sorry I just wanted to know what you're doing in Philip's group. Why did you become my ex-husband's subordinate? Or is it because of Megan?"  
He clenched his jaw. "I don't have a choice, Sarah! That's all you need to know. I've told you, it's dangerous. The less you know, the safer you are."  
"I-is it because of Mariano?" I stammered.  
Josh's mouth hung open in disbelief. Clearly, he hadn't expected me to be so informed. "You are the most moronic woman I've ever met, really!"  
"Ouch!" I winced, "Your words hurt me!"  
He shook his head. "Since you seem to know so much already, I'll fill in the gaps... Mariano was the one who helped me after Megan left me with nothing... I told you about my mother's struggle with schizophrenia-she's the reason I became a doctor...   
"But I intentionally omitted details about my mother from the hospital where I'm employed as a resident. I had hoped... I had hoped to keep that aspect of my life separate from my professional duties."  
Josh's gaze darkened, clouded by profound sadness.  
"Megan played the role of the dutiful daughter-in-law, caring for my mother while I saved lives at the hospital. Eighteen months ago, my mother... she passed away." He paused, swallowing hard against the lump in his throat.  
"Sarah, Megan inherited everything-my family's legacy, properties, and money all vanished in the blink of an eye."  
A chill crept up my spine.  
"At first, I was too numb to comprehend what was happening. I thought, foolishly, that maybe it was some terrible mistake. But no, it was all part of her plan. She had manipulated my vulnerable mother, God knows how! She reported me to the hospital board, claiming I was unfit to practice because of a 'hereditary predisposition' to mental illness. When they found traces of antidepressants in my system-prescribed to help me cope with losing my mother-they painted me as unstable, a risk to patients."  
I was horrified!  
"My family's wealth, my hard-earned reputation, my license to practice-my very identity as a doctor. I was left with nothing! I didn't know where to turn, how to begin again."  
I couldn't utter a word.  
"That's when Mariano stepped in, wanting someone to keep an eye on your husband, and he thought I was the perfect pawn because of my history with Megan. But honestly, I want to strangle that woman with my bare hands! She's living off my money, Sarah! The money she's using to live in luxury all came from various people! She did all of this to be with Philip Cornell."  
"She's not just creepy," I said, my voice shaking with disgust. "She's a monster."  
Josh fell silent, his eyes ablaze with fury.  
"Why didn't you report Megan?"  
"I tried, Sarah! But what my mother signed was legally binding. She truly transferred everything to Megan. The humiliation I endured has kept me from returning to my profession. Moreover, I'm entangled with Mariano like some obedient dog. Right now, my sole desire is to inflict upon Megan the same pain she inflicted upon me-to strip her of everything she took, to drive her to madness!"  
Now that I think about it, I never delved into Megan's background. I knew her before I married Philip, but I've never met her parents, and I'm unaware of her origins. All I know is that she's a socialite, and her parents are supposedly on a cruise.   
Have the Cornells ever met Megan's parents? Is any of it even true?  
Josh's eyes narrowed. "Megan's current objective is to win Philip over, which is why she's lurking at Serenity Pines Estate, waiting to pounce."  
"As for Dr. Smith, you mentioned Philip took Madam Cornell to the island? Are they with Megan?"  
"No, unfortunately. The witch is at Serenity Pines Estate. Regarding your ex's whereabouts, I've only heard he's 'distracting' his mother."  
'Distracting? How?' I wanted to inquire, but Josh continued regardless.  
"My colleague mentioned your ex-husband meeting with an investigator recently"  
I struggled to piece together Philip's actions, the puzzle incomplete until Jane burst into the dining area, her face drained of color.  
Simultaneously, my phone buzzed insistently on the table, Jakob's name flashing on the screen.  
"S-Sarah!" Jane exclaimed, holding her laptop with tears streaming down her face. "You need to see this!"  
"What is it?"  
"An anonymous blogger exposed Madam Cornell! The article is spreading like wildfire across social media and news feeds."  
I was torn between reading the article Jane mentioned, or answering Jakob's call. Perhaps that's why he's reaching out, so I chose to answer his call, placing the phone to my ear.  
"Jake?"  
"Your ex-husband just exposed his mother while she's vacationing on a tropical island. I doubt she's aware of what's unfolding at Highland Hills."  
"What?" It finally clicked. "You mean..."  
"Yes," Jakob confirmed. "Philip is the anonymous blogger, Sarah!"  
The revelation hit me like a physical blow. I never imagined Philip would expose his mother in such a manner, especially considering the risk to Luminary Productions. Wasn't that the reason why I felt unsupported?  
"Do you know why this has garnered so much attention?" Jakob queried. "Sarah, you're not her first victim. Madam Cornell has been playing this game for decades. Every mistress of Chairman Cornell, every potential threat to Philip's inheritance-she's eliminated them all-including those unborn babies!"  
His words echoed in my head as the room began to spin. What a wicked woman! My breathing grew labored, and my vision blurred.   
That woman, that monster, had been willing to destroy anyone to ensure Philip's place.   
Amidst the chaos, I heard the cries of a baby. The phone slipped from my grasp as darkness encroached on my gaze.   
 "Sarah!"
###chapter 82: Price of Power 
**Philip**  

Sitting beside a mahogany-framed square window, I gazed out at the vast expanse of the Caribbean Sea. The water, a mesmerizing blend of azure and turquoise, stretched to the horizon, its gentle waves kissing the pristine white sands of St. Barts. This tranquil paradise starkly contrasted with the tumultuous thoughts swirling in my mind. 
I kept asking myself if what I was about to do was right. Would I be cast as the black sheep, the ungrateful son who turned against his mother? But then I remembered how she always tried to control things, didn't seem to care about anyone's feelings, and only cared about being powerful. It felt like I was just a pawn to my parents. 
After finalizing my thoughts, I exhaled heavily and reviewed the long article again. Then, I picked up the phone and called Bronn. He answered immediately. 
"President Cornell, what a surprise!" 
I got straight to the point. "I heard you were looking for investors for your LoveLogic game app. I'd like to get involved." 
Jane introduced me to Sarah and Jakob's project. She mentioned they were in the final stages of coding while my sister was crafting a unique non-player character-a virtual boyfriend designed to captivate users. 
"Hmmm..." I knew he was likely speculating that my interest stemmed from my complicated relationship with Sarah. I also kept an eye on the stock market, and BM Technologies performed well. 
"Yes, I am seeking investors," Bronn confirmed. "My contract with Luminary and some other security software projects coincided, and that's where some of BM's investors' funds went. Launching an app requires a lot of money." 
I agreed, nodding, though he couldn't see me.  
"Since you're expressing interest, President Cornell, why don't we have you join as a non-player character?" he suggested. 
"How does it work?" I asked. I've tried investing in game apps in the past, but LoveLogic is new ground for me-it's a dating app that mixes real life with make-believe. 
"You'll earn a percentage whenever a player purchases your character as their virtual boyfriend. Since the app uses your appearance as a reference, players get a realistic vision of the character. And if it goes well, we might even get some big-name stars on board." 
I winced, feeling uneasy. "Isn't that... creepy?" 
The thought of people idolizing a digital me feels uncomfortably invasive. 
Bronn chuckled. "You wouldn't understand this generation, President Cornell. Believe it or not, many people create imaginary characters because, let's face it, real people are exhausting." 
Bronn explained more details, and we reached an agreement. I invested in Sarah's project, trusting her entirely with my money. 
I placed a sell order in the stock market for my shares in Luminary Production. I immediately sold half because the company was doing well. Then, I called Megan's phone. 
"Philip?" Megan answered 
"I'm just checking in to see if you're doing okay," I said. Five guards kept a close eye on her, ensuring she remained composed. With Sarah nearby, battling her own panic attack-a situation I had inadvertently triggered-I didn't want to exacerbate her distress. 
"I'm alright, thanks for asking," Megan replied. 
"Megan, I've been thinking. Don't you think it's time to move out of Serenity Pines?" I interjected before she could protest. 
"What? Philip-" 
I cut her off, my tone firm but not unkind. "It's not good that Jane is living with Sarah, and rumors about our relationship are spreading. You've been staying at my place for weeks, and it's not helping the situation. That's all I wanted to say. Thanks!" Before she could respond, I ended the call, knowing it was the right decision. 
As uncertainty clouded my thoughts, Trey, accompanied me on this trip, told me, "Boss, the doctor is already at the restaurant." 
I looked at my laptop screen, where the 'publish' button sat innocently, waiting for my command. With a firm click, I released the article into the online world and then closed my laptop with a gentle thud. The article is set to spread quickly, thanks to a big group of internet users known for causing chaos. Surprisingly, they're everywhere online, always ready to make any scandal even bigger. 
"Here's Madam Cornell's cellphone," Trey handed me my mother's white device. 
I nodded, immediately switching to airplane mode to ensure no unwanted calls would reach her. With her penchant for solitude, she wouldn't notice its absence amidst her card games with the maids. 
"Mom, it's dinner time," I announced as I descended the stairs. 
We went to the island's premier restaurant, where the doctor was a regular patron. The woman's smile faltered upon spotting us. 
"Dr. Smith! What a surprise to see you here," my mother remarked, her tone dripping with sarcasm. 
I feigned surprise, my brows furrowing. "You know each other, Mom?" 
"Of course," my mother replied, her lips curling slightly. 
Despite her composed demeanor, I sensed Dr. Smith's unease. "What brings you here?" she inquired. 
"Just vacationing. And you?" my mother countered nonchalantly. 
I watched Dr. Smith closely. A glance she shot my way said it all. She wasn't worried about my mom-she was concerned about me. 
I discreetly signaled Trey, who promptly alerted the nearby police. They had the warrant I'd secured based on the mountain of evidence I'd painstakingly gathered over the past weeks. 
The international police have already issued 'Red Notices' to alert authorities in Saint Barthélemy, and I am working with them closely. 
A group of local police burst into the restaurant. "Dr. Elaine Smith," the lead officer announced, you are under arrest for the grievous offense of performing illegal abortions." They recited Miranda rights before handcuffing the unprepared Dr. Smith. 
"What's going on?" she exclaimed. "It's Madam Cornell! She's the one! Let me go!" 
"How dare you!" Mother snarled. "Don't you dare entangle me in your sordid affairs! You're the one in handcuffs, not me!" 
"No, you have to believe me! Your mother orchestrated everything! I was merely following her directives! President Cornell, believe me!" the doctor insisted as she was escorted outside to the waiting patrol car, her voice fading away. 
I maintained a façade of detachment, but what truly unsettled me was Mother's utter absence of remorse. She even had the audacity to complain, grumbling about the unfairness of being "pulled into that wretched woman's fabrications." 
"It's time we returned home, Mother," I suggested. "It's time to cut short this vacation." 
"Even better! That woman! She's giving me a headache!" Mother exclaimed. 
We boarded the private jet back to Highland Hills. As my mother searched for her phone, I had no intention of returning it to her just yet; I planned to do so once we reached Highland Hills. 
Upon landing, Trey warned the helpers not to say anything to my mother. Initially confused, they understood when we were accosted by a group of reporters at the airport. My mother clearly hadn't anticipated their presence. 
"Madam Cornell!" one reporter yelled, shoving a microphone toward her. "There's this anonymous blog stirring up trouble with some juicy accusations. What's your take on it?" 
Another, from a national network, chimed in, "Did you really go as far as blackmail and shady stuff like that to keep your spot as Chairman Cornell's better half?" 
"President Cornell," a seasoned investigative journalist asked, her eyes boring into mine, "any theories on who might be behind this exposé?" 
The barrage of questions unsettled my mother. 
"Philip, don't listen to them. I-I'm innocent!" she stammered, visibly shaken. 
Our security detail formed a human barrier, guiding us through the sea of flashing cameras and shouted questions. Mother seemed oblivious to the severity of the situation. The punishment awaiting her at home would undoubtedly be severe, especially with my father's wrath, particularly now with Luminary in jeopardy. 
I had made millions by selling stocks before this scandal hit. However, for my parents and family, the losses were substantial 
That evening, shrouded in darkness, a fleet of police cars rolled up our expansive driveway to invite my mother for investigation. However, they were left empty-handed as my mother had fled the town
###chapter 83: Family Peril 
 **Sarah**   
The darkness enveloped me, and I didn't know how long I was unconscious. When I finally woke up, I found myself in my bedroom. The first thing I saw was Josh, concentrating as he checked my pulse. Around him were worried faces: Amanda and Pepper, looking tense; and Jane, with tear-streaked cheeks. Even the usually stoic guards looked uneasy.  
"Are you alright, Sarah?" Jane asked with concern.  
"Ms. Sarah, you finally regained consciousness!" Amanda exclaimed.   
"We were all so worried," Pepper muttered.   
I tried to sit up, but my body felt heavy, and my mind was still spinning from the panic attack that had knocked me out.  
"Yeah I'm sorry for worrying you..." I murmured.  
"Mr. Benner called your phone while you were unconscious," she said, glancing nervously between me and the others. "We didn't answer, so we wouldn't say anything that might worry him," Jane informed me.  
Jane had some idea about my true relationship with the Benners, especially since Amanda and Pepper were present.  
"Thanks, Jane. That was very thoughtful of you. I'll call Amir later after I've calmed down."  
Josh stood up from his position by the bedside. "It seems the news affected you," he said, sounding all professional yet caring.  "It's important to keep your stress under control. Doing things like exercising, meditating, or even talking to someone could make your panic attacks happen less often and be less intense."  
"Good grief, Josh! You sound more like a doctor than a security staff!" Jane interjected.  
Josh simply raised an eyebrow, not bothering to say anything in return. "Anyway, it's late. I need to get back to Serenity Pines. Your guard has been giving me the eye for a while now."  
I glanced at the guard standing by the door. "Thanks, Josh!"  
The guard escorted him out. I held Jane's hand and asked, "Are you alright?" noticing the tear stains on her eyes.  
With the news that many had been victimized by Madam Cornell, it was a miracle and fortunate that Jane survived.  
"Oh, Sarah! I was so terrified earlier. Do you think Madam Cornell did those awful things? Do you think she's trying to prevent my dad's mistresses from having another heir?"  
A wave of sorrow washed over me. The memories of what I went through with my ex-mother-in-law came back suddenly, bringing back the pain and feeling of being betrayed. It made me realize that the accusations against Madam Cornell were probably true.   
I also couldn't believe that the scandal about the Cornells would come from Philip. I chose to keep that a secret from Jane.  
"Whether it's true or not, you are safe, Jane. Besides, this is the time for Madam Cornell to pay for her sins," I said, giving her a faint smile.  
"My nanny once told me that my mother was Dad's favorite mistress. That's all I know. I was only three when I was brought to Cornell Mansion because my mother passed away. I can't confirm the truth of those rumors, but I'm grateful that Dad and Brother Philip both favor me."  
I doubt my ex-mother-in-law will ever regain her status as Madam Cornell. The scandals in the Cornell family have been relentless: first Jane's cancellation of the Olsen marriage, then Madam Cornell's scandal. It's evident that the chairman is displeased with the current state of affairs.  
"You should call your father to check on him. It might be a good time to gain his favor," I suggested to my friend.  
"I'll do that. Let me know if you need anything, even the slightest thing, call me from the other room. okay?" she replied.  
"I love you, loves!"  
After Jane left, Amanda and Pepper followed suit, ensuring I didn't require their assistance for the day.  
Glancing at my phone, I noticed a few messages waiting for me.  
***Jakob:*** *Are you okay, Sarah?*  
I decided to respond. He was the last person I spoke to before blacking out.  
I tapped out a quick reply: I'm doing fine. Thanks, Jakob!  
Next came a message from Amir: *The Luminary Production is in serious trouble. Their stock value is plummeting. Your ex-in-laws are going to suffer significant losses.*  
This made me wonder about Philip's strategy in handling the situation.  
Bronn's message came next: *I'm heading back to Dubai for a business trip. Let's try to meet up if your schedule permits.*  
Since Bronn and I already had plans, I agreed to meet him. It's comforting to have someone to share my time and thoughts with.  
The most surprising message was from Emily, my assistant. I had asked her to think again about quitting suddenly, feeling she might be acting on emotions rather than careful thought.  
***Emily:*** *Sarah, I've decided to stay.*  
The reasons she quit and then decided to stay puzzled me. But whatever it was, it made me happy. In the snake pit of high society, a trustworthy ally like Emily was worth more than gold.  
I can only pray that my intuition doesn't fail me!  
***  
Throughout the night, a cascade of events unfolded, with the scandal surrounding the Cornells reaching a crescendo. Luminary's respected PR had been trying hard to manage the situation, but it seemed like their efforts weren't working. People's opinions may be beyond their control.  
"The helper I spoke with last night informed me that Madam Cornell has gone missing. Allegedly, the police investigator visited the mansion to summon her due to implications made by Dr. Smith, who was apprehended in Saint Barthélemy. What's perplexing is that Brother Philip and his mother were also present there," Jane relayed. 
I listened in silence, a mixture of melancholy and inquiry weighing heavy in my chest. It seemed Philip had indeed taken matters into his own hands, demonstrating to his mother how he ensnared the doctor.  
"In other news, it seems Megan is on the lookout for a new residence. Brother Philip seems to be questioning her tenure at Serenity Pines Estate," Jane continued.   
I pretended not to care, but the hurt in my eyes gave me away. It felt like looking in a mirror and seeing the broken pieces of my hopes staring back at me.  
"Sarah, why can't you find it in yourself to forgive Brother Philip? Is it because you suspect he's involved with Megan? Is that why you two had that terrible falling out?" Jane probed gently.  
"Absolutely not. Megan has nothing to do with this. Nothing at all," I replied.  
The truth caught in my throat, begging to be spoken. Philip doesn't love me. He never did. But I choked back the words, feeling their bitterness. Saying them out loud would only reopen a wound that was still raw.  
Later that day, a special invitation landed in my hands-a platinum ticket from Eternal Elegance, signed by Azuré. It gave me the chance to see her new collection before anyone else. Perfect timing, too. Rumor had it Azuré was in town, causing quite a stir among the socialites.  
As our vehicle drifted past Serenity Pines Estate, my attention was drawn to a reserved young woman standing outside, her demeanor suggesting she was in her late teens.  
'Who is she?' I pondered silently.  
'Or could she be... Philip's mistress?'
###chapter 84: Ticket Trouble 
**Sarah**   
My expression darkened as the vehicle passed the woman outside Serenity Pines, my mind preoccupied with the urge to splurge. It had been too long since I treated myself, and with upcoming business engagements and travel plans, I knew I needed to indulge. Before long, we reached Eternal Elegance's boutique.  
In the grand lobby, we were met with a scene straight out of a magazine. Socialites filled the space, lounging on luxurious couches and carefully flipping through glossy brochures. The air was rich with the scent of pricey perfumes and the soft murmurs of the well-to-do. Amidst them, I spotted Rebecca with Megan.  
"Goodness gracious!" Jane muttered as she caught sight of the evil duo. "Four o'clock..." she murmured.  
As the two approached us, Rebecca's disdain was palpable. "Well, well Can you believe it, Megan? They let trash in here now," she sneered, a smirk playing on her lips.  
"Really? Funny you mention that, considering you're the one I see," Jane retorted.   
Rebecca gritted her teeth.   
"What?" Jane's petite frame straightened, glaring at her cousin.  
"Listen up, Jane," Rebecca spat, her tone dripping with malice. "Your dad cut you off. You're broke. You can't even afford a tissue here, let alone anything else!"  
"Oh, is that so?" Jane scoffed, brandishing her black card from Chanel purse. "It looks like you're misinformed, dear cousin. My brother lent me his black card. So, I can buy whatever I want!"  
Rebecca's eyes narrowed.   
"And aren't your family facing financial ruin?" Megan chimed in, "And yet, you're here splurging while Luminary Productions is facing a lot of things. How... irresponsible!"  
"That's none of your concern, Megan," I interjected, drawing her attention.  
She turned to me; her tone accusatory. "And you, just because you're warming Mr. Benner's bed doesn't mean you can afford even a single piece in this place!"  
Jane bristled, ready to correct her misconception about my relationship with Amir, but I held her back.   
"I suppose it's a unique experience when a scum won't stop chattering," I remarked casually, noting the hushed murmurs that encircled us.  
"What?!" Megan snapped. My words hit her hard, and for a moment, I thought she might attack me, forgetting all about manners.  
"Megan, let's not forget, you reside in Serenity Pines Estate-my private villa. So, I suppose it's worth pondering who the true scum and squatter might be, isn't it?"  
"You, absolute bitch!" she spat, her lips twisted in a fake smile, but her teeth ground together.  
"Come on, Megan. Let's not waste another moment with these classless women," Rebecca declared, ushering her friend away from us.  
Jane continued her attempts to intimidate her cousin, but I shook my head in response.   
Emerging from the most secure area of the boutique, the staff delivered an announcement: "Good afternoon, esteemed ladies! I'm pleased to announce that Miss Azuré is now ready to welcome her most exclusive clients. If you're lucky enough to have a platinum ticket, please come forward."  
The jeweler, situated on the second floor, boasted tighter security measures.  
"Let's go!" I urged Jane, making our way towards the assistant.  
I sensed stares from the other ladies, filled with envy, resentment, and reluctant admiration. They knew Jane well as a member of the Cornell Family. To them, Jane's presence was expected, as if it were her natural place.  
Rebecca intercepted us, followed closely by Megan. "And just where do you think you're going?" she demanded.  
Ignoring their intrusion, I handed the assistant the long, thick, platinum ticket. "Here."  
Megan's eyes grew wide, but it was Rebecca who lost it.  
"T-this... it can't be!" she stammered, her face twisting in an unattractive way. "That woman! She... she must have taken that ticket from me! It's mine, I tell you!" Rebecca accused vehemently.  
I stared at her, momentarily stunned by the sheer audacity of her accusation. This woman was ultimately out of control.  
The commotion drew the attention of every woman in the boutique and shifted their attention towards us.  
"Is it true, Miss?" the staff inquired, flanked by two security guards. "Miss Azuré said only two platinum tickets were distributed here at Highland Hills."  
"See!" Rebecca declared, her chin sticking out boldly. "I'm one of them! Azuré herself gave me a platinum ticket, and now it's missing!"  
The assistant turned to me, seeking clarification. "Tell me your name, miss?"  
"I'm Sarah Mitchell."  
"That's right! She's an orphan and doesn't even have the means to buy your cheapest jewelry here. Having a platinum ticket is impossible for her, don't you think?" Megan interjected.  
"That's right! If she could steal a ticket, who's to say she won't take the jewelry upstairs? She's crazy! Give me back that ticket now, you lunatic!" Rebecca exclaimed, causing a stir among the onlookers, who began murmuring amongst themselves.  
Megan stepped forward to support her friend Rebecca and addressed the assistant. "We're not backing down! Do you know what you're doing? Letting in a thief, stealing a platinum ticket? Is that how little you care about your job at Eternal Elegance?"  
The assistant whispered to the guard beside her, who promptly went inside.  
My lips twitch upward in amusement.   
Jane scoffed, "Miss Assistant, you can't seriously believe these two? They've been annoying us since we arrived. They might be the ones who took our stuff!"  
Rebecca raised an eyebrow. "I am Rebecca Cornell! A socialite in this town! Who else would Azuré give a platinum ticket to?"  
I chuckled and asked, "Are you sure, Rebecca?"  
"Absolutely! I'd stake my name on it! You stole that ticket from me!" she insisted.  
"Rebecca, the Cornell family is already mired in scandal. Do you really want to add to your disgrace?" I countered.  
"Both of you, stop! You're not just keeping Azuré waiting. You're wasting other customers' time!" an irate woman snapped.  
Everyone chimed in, agreeing with her.  
"Accusing me of stealing what is rightfully mine is unforgivable!" I declared, producing the envelope that accompanied my platinum ticket. Before I could continue, a woman in her fifties emerged from the dark glass door.  
"What's going on here?" It was Azuré.  
The assistant, looking slightly embarrassed, stepped forward. "Ma'am, I apologize for the disturbance. Miss Rebecca Cornell is accusing this lady of stealing a platinum ticket."  
Azuré raised an eyebrow. Rebecca trembled but tried to remain composed. "Miss Azuré, how lovely to see you! I'm Rebecca Cornell, the rightful owner of that platinum ticket."  
"I do recall giving a platinum ticket to another Cornell" Azuré smiled slightly before turning to me. "Miss Sarah. I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems some people will go to any extreme..."  
A murmur rippled through the crowd. "Did you hear that?"   
"Azuré knows Sarah Mitchell personally," a bystander whispered.  
Rebecca's face paled, her designer makeup failing to hide her shock. Her voice trembled. "Y-you... you know that orphan? This is impossible!"  
"What's truly impossible is your audacity to accuse me of theft!" I retorted. "That platinum ticket came to me this afternoon with this envelope." I waved the rectangle envelope right in her face. "Oops, it says, 'Invitation to Miss Sarah Mitchell.' Are you Sarah Mitchell?"  
Rebecca's carefully painted lips parted in shock. People were whispering, and some people shook their heads, feeling sorry or showing disapproval.  
I added, "Of course, you don't know the name on the platinum ticket because you never actually had one."  
Panic flashed in Rebecca's eyes. Her eyes darted around, searching for a way out. Then, like someone drowning, she grabbed onto a quick excuse.   
"No! I'm sorry. I was just surprised to see the platinum ticket with Sarah. Miss Azuré, I'm really sorry. I am the other person you gave a platinum ticket to. I am a Cornell. I-I just thought the one given to Sarah was actually mine."  
"You don't know what you're talking about, do you?" Azuré's usually warm gaze now looked icy, sounding disappointed and scornful.  
Rebecca trembled as she tried to hold back tears. She looked to Megan for support, but her friend had stepped back, avoiding eye contact.  
Azuré continued, "I don't give platinum tickets to just anyone."  
A cruel but brilliant idea sparked in my mind. "Miss Azuré, if you don't mind, could I also bring Miss Rebecca Cornell inside? As a former relative, I feel I should extend some courtesy. Maybe she's interested in a specific item and worries someone with a platinum ticket might buy it before she can."  
"Of course, Ms. Mitchell. You're kind. Not everyone would be so forgiving after a mix-up like that," the jeweler commented.  
"Thank us later, bitch!" Jane snapped, rolling her eyes at Rebecca.  
"How about you, Megan? Wanna join?" I asked.  
These women must see what I have! I plan to buy something other than a simple piece of jewelry. They must know how crazy rich I am.  
But I didn't expect Philip to ruin my plan.
###chapter 85: Shiny Splurge 
**Sarah**  

An elegant boutique on the upper floor greeted us warmly. Pausing to soak in the ambiance, I admired the rich burgundy velvet walls that served as a luxurious backdrop to the gleaming glass display cases showcasing glittering jewelry.  
 While Megan and Rebecca browsed the items, I observed the vigilant security and attentive staff at each stand. 
"Come here, Ms. Sarah," Azuré, the jewelry shop owner, called to me. She led me to a single, elegant red couch and offered me some champagne. 
"Sarah, what do you think about these cufflinks?" Jane asked as she approached, accompanied by a staff member who was protecting the cufflink. "Do you think they'd suit Brother Philip?" 
I picked up the expensive item and examined it closely. I imagined Philip wearing them with his favorite deep navy Armani suit, highlighting his face's aristocratic lines.  
"They would look perfect on Philip." 
"You have a good eye, Miss Cornell. That is the most precious cufflink piece in the house. It's rare because the stones are natural light blue diamonds," Azuré commented. 
I decided to buy it. Even if I couldn't give it to Philip, there was always Bronn or Amir. 
"Azuré, I wanted to-"  
Megan interrupted me. "I want to buy those cufflinks! Please include them in my bill," she said, a smile playing at the corner of her lips. 
Jane looked surprised and annoyed. "Excuse me! Have you no manners? I saw these cufflinks first. Besides, you and Rebecca just tagged along with us!" Jane complained. 
"Come on, Jane. Let's be real! We both know I'll be presenting these to Philip. After all, our relationship is... progressing." Megan insisted. 
Azuré cleared her throat delicately. "Ms. Mitchell, remember that you are still Eternal Elegance's priority. If you wish to buy the cufflink, it will be yours," Azuré assured me as her VIP client. 
"Let Jane have them. She found them first. It's only fair," I replied. 
Megan kept her calm. In my mind, maybe the cufflink wasn't meant for me, so I let it go. 
"I'll take it!" Jane declared with a hint of victory 
"How about this-why don't we let the ladies choose their pieces first? I'm in no hurry. I can make my selection afterward," I suggested. 
Rebecca suppressed a laugh, crossing her arms and smirking at me. "Come on, Sarah. Just admit that you can't afford it. I'm curious how you got that platinum ticket from Ms. Azuré. It's not like you're supposed to be here or anything" 
"Miss Cornell, are you implying that I lack intelligence?" Azuré remarked, narrowing her eyes. 
"N-no... I'm just trying to say" 
This woman still seemed dissatisfied with my possession of the platinum ticket.  
Eventually, they finished making their selections. Rebecca opted for a bracelet and earrings, while Jane chose a bracelet and a delicate necklace for herself, along with the light blue diamond cufflink. Megan selected five sets of diamond jewelry. 
"Now that we've made our selections, it's your turn, Sarah," Megan smirked. 
I shook my head; they genuinely believed I was incapable of purchasing jewelry. 
"Azuré, I have faith in your expertise. As always, I'd like to see your most exceptional pieces." 
The lady beamed and motioned for her assistants to approach me. They presented an array of items: thick diamond-encrusted bracelets, sapphires, green emeralds, and more. The table in front of me was adorned with sparkling jewelry. 
"These are among the rarest pieces in my collection, Ms. Mitchell," Azuré proudly said. 
I nodded. "How about a cufflink? Do you have one priced between fifty and one hundred thousand?" 
The size and type of stone often determine the price of a piece of jewelry, and I anticipated that the size I mentioned would suffice. 
"Certainly," Azuré replied. 
A staff member brought forward a cufflink adorned with a small diamond. Given that my brother doesn't like things that are too flashy, this cufflink would be a good fit for Amir. 
"How much is this?" I inquired. 
But just as Azuré was about to reply, Rebecca interrupted, her tone filled with disdain. "Why, Sarah? Is that all you can afford? Are you settling for the cheapest options now?" 
"Who said I'm only purchasing this? I intend to acquire all the items on the table," I declared, pointing to each piece.  
Their shock was palpable. 
"That's ridiculous!" Rebecca blurted out. "How do you plan to afford all of those? You're nothing but a gold-digger! You're delusional if you think Philip will foot this bill for you!" 
Azuré's voice cut through the tension, "Miss Rebecca Cornell! I've noticed for a while now that you're being disrespectful to my client!" Her tone rose sharply, causing Rebecca to flinch visibly. "I don't think you understand the significance of Ms. Mitchell's platinum ticket. To put it in perspective for you, just last year alone, she invested over thirty million in my collection!" 
"What?" Megan exclaimed. "Thirty million? But how? I mean, look at her dress!" She gestured wildly at my attire. "It's just a simple black dress, not even a recognizable brand!" 
Azuré shook her head in disbelief. "I never thought I'd encounter someone so culturally ignorant in this town." 
Before anyone could respond, Philip's voice boomed across the boutique, "How dare you think you can decide I won't buy these things? Do you see me as some financial imbecile?"  
Each word felt like a slap, making Rebecca visibly shrink. Jane watched the scene unfold, silently observing the drama. 
Rebecca stammered in response, "I-I'm just concerned, Philip. You and Sarah have separated. It's only natural for me to be concerned. I just don't want our family to be publicly discussed." 
Philip's retort was swift and cutting. "I don't need your concern." He reached into his fancy suit jacket and took out a shiny black card. He handed it to Azuré, looking annoyed. "Charge every single item Ms. Mitchell selects to this card. Every. Single. One." 
Rebecca's lip quivered, on the brink of tears. 
"Philip, come on, Rebecca's just looking out for you," Megan interjected, attempting to diffuse the tension. 
Desperate to contribute, I spoke up, "And Philip, this isn't necessary. I can pay! I'll cover everything!" 
The brute ignored my attempt to interject, his attention entirely on Azuré. "Thank you, Azuré, for the platinum ticket. I appreciate the gesture and the exclusivity it represents.." 
The revelation stunned the two women. Rebecca's face drained of color while I raised an eyebrow in curiosity. 
Rebecca's fear was palpable as she turned her gaze towards the jeweler, directing her question to Philip: "Are you the other recipient of a platinum ticket?" 
Azuré's gaze narrowed. "Indeed. You not only insulted my client with your rude actions but also made things worse by trying to lie. You made up a wild story, saying you received the platinum ticket. Did you really think I wouldn't see through your weak excuse? It looks like you underestimated me." 
"Before I even think about trusting you, you need to act with the honesty and decency of Ms. Mitchell. But honestly, I don't think it's worth hoping for. I dislike liars, especially those who insult my intelligence like you just did!" 
At that moment, frustration flooded over me like a tidal wave. Philip had single-handedly derailed my carefully laid plans! 
"Did you hear that?" Rebecca's voice was loud and upset, her face mixed with anger and embarrassment. "Don't even think about comparing me to her! She's nothing but a gold digger!" She squeezed her fists, her nails pressing into her palms. "It's obvious! She only picked those things because Philip is paying for them. She's just taking advantage of him!" 
"Rebecca, do you still not grasp the situation?" I queried, trying to remain composed. "Let me make it crystal clear for you. Whether it's Philip or not, I can afford my own luxuries because I am Sarah Benner!" 
The name dropped like a bombshell in the boutique. Megan and Rebecca's jaws dropped in perfect synchronization, and their eyes widened to comical proportions.  
"W-what?" they gasped in unison. 
"Yes, 'that' Sarah Benner! "And just to put things into perspective, my net worth is approximately triple that of Philip's. So, yes, I'm an orphan, but that doesn't mean I'm without a family or resources." 
I turned to the jeweler. "Miss Azuré, could you do me a favor and let it be known that this lady lacks manners terribly? I have no desire to cross paths with her again, as she's become a source of considerable stress for me! It's their behavior that pushes me to indulge in spending, for heaven's sake!" 
"Ms. Mitchell, please don't worry. I'll personally see to it that Rebecca Cornell is blacklisted." She snapped her fingers, and two sharp-looking security guards appeared. "Gentlemen, escort these women out!" 
Rebecca's social standing would undoubtedly take a hit! In this high society and luxury retail world, your reputation means everything. Once people heard about this, more stores would stop serving her, kicking her out of the elite circles she desperately clung to. 
Meanwhile, Philip watched quietly as I let Jane handle the jewelry. I quickly made up an excuse about a meeting to avoid his attention.  
Later that night, I went to Las Vegas to meet Bronn, accompanied by Emily...
###chapter 86: Entangled Affair 
**Sarah**  

Bronn and Jakob welcomed us at the airport. BM Technologies is located in a nearby metropolitan area. The presentation and launch of LoveLogic are set to take place in a hotel-casino, and Bronn has invited numerous personalities. Amanda accompanied me on the trip while Pepper was left in Jane's care at Amir's villa in Highland Hills. 
This is part of a long list of business trips my assistant and I will attend.  
As we walked, Jakob explained, "The launch date for LoveLogic has been pushed up. It's a strategic move. It's better to introduce it to the market now than to face potential accusations of plagiarism later. Bronn says we've got significant backing-venture firms, and angel investors. They pulled strings to get us a prime slot at the launch." 
I nodded, understanding the pressure. Me and Jakob have been working round the clock. 
"We've wrapped up five phases, laying a strong foundation that should captivate players for a few months. However, there's no time to pause. As they delve into these phases, we'll be hard at work coding new scenarios, crafting even more realistic characters, and bolstering our security measures. We'll unveil our special characters to our VIP players in two months." 
"And that, my friend, is why we're in this neon-lit, casino-studded town!" Jakob said, smiling broadly. 
I shook my head. That's when I noticed that Emily and Bronn, who were following us, were both quiet. Amanda was ahead, talking to the hotel staff. 
'Hmmm What's up with those two?' 
"Hey!" I called to Jakob, not wanting to be overheard. "You didn't answer my question about Emily" 
Jakob draped his arm over my shoulder, effectively shielding our conversation. "Uh, you're safe with her, don't worry!" 
"It's not just that She quit as my assistant, then changed her mind. Does she resent me? Did I push too hard?" 
I also wondered if she knew my true identity. 
"Sarah, you also have to trust your instincts. Do you think Emily is dangerous?" my friend asked curiously. 
I glanced at Emily, observing her closely. She seemed tense but not hostile. When our eyes briefly met, I noticed fatigue and maybe a bit of worry but no sign of ill intent. "No," I concluded. "I don't think she's dangerous." 
"Then that's all that matters. You have to get to know her personally. Not every puzzle needs solving, and not everyone needs investigating. Sometimes, the best information comes from just talking to someone," Jakob reasoned. 
He's got a point! As time passes, I'll become even more acquainted with my assistant. I merely shrugged. What matters most is that I have yet to encounter any issues with her thus far.  
We stepped into the luxurious suite, the door swinging open to reveal a space that was less a hotel room and more a high-end apartment, complete with three bedrooms. Amanda would occupy one of them. 
"Your security team is booked in the adjacent room, so there shouldn't be any personal space concerns, but they'll still be close if needed," Bronn informed me. 
"How about Emily?" I inquired. "I don't mind if she stays here in my suite." My eyes drifted to the third bedroom. 
"Don't worry about your assistant. I've also booked a separate room for her," Bronn assured. "Is that arrangement acceptable to you?" 
"No problem at all. That's thoughtful of you, Bronn! Thanks for sorting that out, too!" I smiled and expressed gratitude. 
It's a relief that Emily will have her own space. I realized I hadn't even asked if she had a spouse or family waiting for her back home.  
"Enjoy your evening, Sarah!" Emily's voice cut through my thoughts.  
"Thank you, dear! If you need anything, drop me a message. And please keep your phone on, if it's alright, so I can reach you easily if needed," I requested. 
She nodded understandingly. "Of course!" 
Per our agreement, Bronn escorted Emily to her room while Jakob and I settled in to discuss LoveLogic and our presentation to the investors. 
After two hours of planning, Jakob stood up from the comfy chair, stretching his long limbs. It was already nine o'clock. "I'm famished," he said. "Let's grab a late dinner or maybe even hit a party! My treat. Meet me at Prime Steakhouse in a bit." 
I agreed, but then I remembered. "Oh, and make sure to dress up. They're strict about the dress code there." 
His expression soured. "Should I change our plans to room service instead?" 
"Oh, come on! You hardly ever get dressed up!" 
"Fine!" Jakob grumbled as he left the suite, despite being the one who suggested going out.  
This rascal! 
I sent Bronn and Emily messages, inviting them to join us for the late dinner. I felt a little guilty as I texted Emily. I forgot to check if she had eaten already. Jakob and I were so focused on our work that it slipped my mind to ask. She might have already drifted off to sleep. 
Neither of them replied, so I assumed they were resting. 
Before heading out, I knocked on Amanda's door to inform her of my activity. She responded from within, sounding sleepy, but expressed her preference to catch some rest. 
Guided by a stoic guard, I weaved through the maze-like halls of the lavish estate, heading for Prime Steakhouse. 
I sent a quick message to Jakob: I'll wait for you at Prime Steakhouse. I'm starving!  
Jakob's reply came soon after: I'll be there shortly. I'm not accustomed to dressing up. I'm cleaning up my thick layer of dirt. 
What an idiot! 
As I strode through a corridor, I caught sight of Emily exiting a room. Ah, so her quarters are close to mine. She looked stunning in her blush chiffon dress, as though she had plans for the evening. 
"Emily!" I called out, but she had already disappeared around the corner.  
Perhaps she had already seen my message. In the hallway, she was with Bronn. They were having a heated argument, standing close with tense bodies and faces almost touching. They were so focused on their argument that they didn't see me or the other guests quickly moving by, stealing glances at them. 
The dimly lit hallway and my black attire allowed me to observe without being noticed. A few other people milled about, but my attention was solely on them, and this is where I gleaned all I needed to know. 
Bronn stood in Emily's way, blocking her path.  
"Why did you leave, Emily?" he demanded, his voice filled with both pain and rage. It was a tone I'd never heard from him before, so full of emotion and vulnerability. Did they know each other outside of work? 
"Let me go, Mr. Martin!" Emily's tone was firm, and her frustration was evident. I contemplated intervening, but curiosity kept me rooted in place. 
"Answer me, damn it!" Bronn persisted. The calm mask he usually wore disappeared, showing a man deeply troubled by unanswered questions. 
"You want an answer? Because you're marrying Ms. Benner! I left because it was the right thing to do! What did you expect? That I'd stay, be your mistress? Be your special someone on the side? Your comfort in bed?" Her voice trembled at the end. "I have rules, Bronn. I do what's right, even if it hurts me. So don't you dare question my choices!" 
I felt as though I had walked right into the middle of a soap opera. The scene playing out in front of me was filled with such intense emotions and personal turmoil that I couldn't help but feel like I was intruding on something private.  
"Then why come back? You were gone. I Why return and stir everything up again?" Bronn retorted, frustration evident in his voice. 
Unable to stay silent, I interjected, catching both of their attention. "You know what I hate?" I muttered, seizing the moment.  
Emily couldn't meet my gaze while Bronn released his grip on her. 
"Men who ask dumb questions when the answers are staring them right in the face! Now, you better start talking. What the hell is going on here?" I directed my question at Bronn, convinced he held the key to the truth.
###chapter 87: Betrayal's Bitter Dawn 
**Sarah**  

From what I heard, Bronn and Emily had a past relationship, but she left. They met again just recently. 
I had always wondered about Bronn's romantic history; now, it all makes sense. The truth came out like a bittersweet story: he and Emily had shared an intimate relationship. 
"Let's discuss this privately," Bronn suggested. 
I followed Bronn's suggestion, and he invited us to a restaurant, bringing Emily along. I could feel Emily trembling slightly like a leaf in the wind, though she showed no emotion. Perhaps she was trying to be brave about the situation. 
We sat at a table inside the restaurant. Emily sat beside me but still couldn't look at me. 
"Speak!" I demanded of Bronn. 
Bronn glanced at Emily, silently asking if he could talk about their past together. "I'm not sure what you heard, but it's true. I had a relationship with Emily before." 
Should I be angry about that? No. 
Emily followed Bronn's statement. "I was Mr. Martin's mistress for two years. I ended the relationship four years ago when I heard about your marriage." 
My mouth dropped at this revelation. That was when the Benners disowned me, and my wedding with Bronn didn't happen because I was in love with Philip. My lips formed a straight line. 
I hadn't respected or seriously considered marrying Bronn back then. So, should I be upset that they were together? No. 
"I married another man, so why did you leave?" I asked. 
Emily opened her mouth, looking confused. "I-I didn't know you married another man." 
I pieced the scenarios together, which led me to say the following words. "You thought I was still going to marry Bronn. And when you found out I'm Sarah Benner, you filed your resignation. Is that the reason?" 
Emily slowly nodded, her head dipping as if to say yes. She was guilty, showing the pain of a woman who had loved deeply but had to leave because of it. Four years ago, she walked away from Bronn with her heart bleeding, believing he was marrying another woman. 
"But what I don't get," I said, "is why you changed your mind again..." 
Is Emily seeking revenge, viewing me as the one who destroyed her dreams? Or is her return linked to Bronn, an irresistible force she can't escape? Questions flooded my mind, multiplying like echoes in a cave. 
"I... I'd rather speak with you privately, Sarah. I can only say that Bronn and I are not involved romantically at this moment. I'm aware of the rumors circulating about Mr. Martin's romantic interests, and I've heard about your intentions to proceed with the wedding..." 
I turned my gaze towards Bronn, who was sitting across from me. His face wore a mask of stoic indifference. Earlier, I overheard him questioning Emily's presence as if she were the one who got away. 
"Could we step outside for a moment? I need to talk to you," I asked Bronn, rising from my seat and making my way to the garden, an elegantly landscaped extension of the high-end restaurant, 
Perhaps that's why I couldn't muster genuine feelings of love or romance for him, even though we were engaged before, and our trial dates. 
I crossed my arms, the chill of the night air seeping in. Standing in the center of the garden, despite the relative seclusion, I could still hear the distant hum of the hotel and the party. 
I felt Bronn's presence behind me and turned to find him bathed in the gentle light of the garden, which softened his chiseled features. 
"This isn't right, Bronn. I mean, you and I... A romantic relationship between us is just not feasible," I immediately led. 
"But why? I'm not involved with Emily anymore," he interjected, his tone tinged with uncertainty. 
"Then answer me this: you knew we were destined for marriage, yet Emily existed. I know it was more like a business deal than anything else, but still, it meant something. I didn't expect you to be faithful or to love me, not really. But why did you have someone else? What do I even call her? A side chick? A girlfriend? And why Emily? Why not anyone?" My tone wasn't accusing, just curious about the man I was supposed to marry. 
"I don't know, Sarah... Because I'm a man? That's a pathetic excuse, I know Look, you were only sixteen when Emily and I started. I called her a 'mistress' because our families expected us to marry. I supported her financially-her school fees, apartment, designer clothes, everything..." he explained. 
"So, you were basically paying Emily to be your mistress until I turned eighteen?" I clarified. 
"That's correct," he confirmed, his voice barely audible. 
Having a mistress is utterly disgusting, yet it's an unfortunate reality. Many businessmen engage in extramarital affairs. My father is no exception; he has had mistresses. Even Chairman Cornell. This is precisely why I once suspected Philip of cheating with his secretary. 
"But you fell in love with Emily" I was certain of that.  
I witnessed the way Bronn gazed at Emily earlier, a look that spoke of deep affection and longing. It was undeniable; it was clear they had a special connection like they were in their own little world. Seeing that made me realize I didn't have a chance with Bronn. 
Steeling myself, I confronted him directly, "Bronn, I came from a failed marriage. What I desperately want now is a lovely family, a man who would love me romantically and unconditionally, without reservation. We're good friends, but can you honestly picture yourself being romantically involved with me?" I asked, already knowing the answer. 
His lips trembled as he struggled to respond. "I-I'm sorry" 
"You see? I understand that pursuing you would only lead to heartache, Bronn." It was a difficult realization to grasp, but I had to acknowledge it: my hopes of love with him were nothing more than an impossible dream. 
It seemed I had to come to terms with the fact that Bronn and I would never be more than friends. As I was processing this, my phone rang, displaying Jakob's name. I spotted him inside the restaurant, apparently searching for me. 
"I need to take this call; we're not done yet," I informed Bronn sternly before answering.  
Without exchanging pleasantries, I addressed Jakob, "Come out here. We're in the garden area." 
"Understood, boss!" Jakob replied, chuckling before I hung up. 
A restaurant server guided Jakob outside. He immediately saw that Bronn and I were having a serious talk. 
"You smell human!" I blurted out, unable to contain my surprise at his decidedly business casual attire, just as he had promised. 
Disregarding my comment, Jakob remarked, "I saw Emily inside She's been drinking wine." 
"Yes! She's with us Now, tell me the truth! Did you conspire with Bronn and not tell me about Emily's background?" I felt a sense of betrayal. I had never imagined Jakob would choose loyalty to Bronn over me. 
"Uh" Jakob hesitated, scratching his head as he searched for an explanation. 
It was then that Bronn dropped a bombshell, "Jakob is my brother... He's the only person who knows Emily because... we're brothers." 
"What?" I gasped, my eyes widening in utter disbelief and confusion. "What the hell, Jakob?! The room whenever we had video chats, was it a rented room? Or a place in your mansion in Henderson?" 
The truth hit me hard. I had never visited Jakob in his supposed apartment in Henderson. All I remembered was him talking about having a roommate and a small bed. But he'd been using my car, or my Netflix account, always dressed casually. Nothing hinted that he was Bronn's brother, the millionaire behind the tech giant BM Technology.  
I had met Bronn's grandfather previously and interacted with his parents on a few occasions, but I had never crossed paths with Jakob. 
Jakob raised both his hands, seemingly understanding what was going through my mind. 
"Listen, doll. I-I can explain Please, you've got to understand; you hid who you really are from me too!" 
I felt as if my own secrecy had rebounded on me like I was being punished. 
"The two of you! I don't want to talk to you for the time being!" I told them firmly. 
Leaving the restaurant alone, my bodyguard followed me until I found myself in a bar, drowning my thoughts in alcohol. 
It felt like everyone in my life was playing a role, including myself, the biggest pretender of all. Damn it! 
As I drank, I couldn't shake off the question: should I try to make new friends or accept being alone? I felt like I let down those I cared about, and they let me down, too. My disappointment outweighed my anger.  
Jakob knew everything about me, but I never thought he'd hurt me like this. But then, who was I to demand answers from him? 
The hours trickled by, and I lost all sense of time and awareness. Drinking wasn't my usual pastime. 
In a twist of ironic fate, when I woke up the following morning, I found myself confronted with the startling realization that I had remarried my 'first' husband overnight! 
I woke up to the sight of perhaps the largest engagement ring I'd ever seen on my finger and our marriage license innocently lying on the bed. 
'What the hell just happened, Sarah!'  
I don't want to drink margaritas anymore.
###chapter 88: Intoxicated 
**Philip**  

"Philip, did you know Sarah is Miss Benner? She's a liar! How can she pretend to be someone else? Do you believe her words?" Megan said in an accusatory tone, waiting for me outside Azuré's boutique. "It's impossible for Sarah to live away from the Benners. She probably just said that to embarrass Rebecca and get your attention!" 
I forcefully pulled Megan away from the staring onlookers, dragging her so quickly toward her car that her heels clacked on the pavement. I ignored her comments about Sarah because I already knew the truth. 
"Megan, go home! Do you want me to remind you of the huge amount of money you lost in Luminary Productions?" 
"So why are you spending on Sarah's luxuries?" she said, her eyes full of barely hidden envy. 
"I'm a car racer. My life doesn't revolve solely around Luminary Productions. But that is not your concern! The police investigators are now looking for my mother. Do you have any idea where she might be?" My voice became accusing. After all, my mother and Megan used to be close. 
Megan swallowed hard. "Philip, of course not! Do you think I would hide Madam Cornell? Besides, you can't possibly believe that ridiculous accusation Dr. Smith made against your mother!" 
She reached out and trailed a fingertip down my chest in a blatant attempt at seduction. "If I did know something about your mother's location, would you agree to make me your wife?" 
I grabbed her hands firmly, preventing her from continuing the unwanted caress, raising the corner of my lips. "Megan, I know what you're doing. Listen closely; I know everything, including your involvement in Sarah's abortion. Now, I'll be the one proposing to you-I want your message soon, telling me my mother's whereabouts!" 
My eyes narrowed dangerously. "Please leave my Serenity Pines estate immediately, or I will have to call the police and report you for trespassing!" 
I turned and walked away quickly, tugging at my expensive coat. Megan stayed still, looking shocked, as she watched me leave. 
As I entered the stylish sedan waiting at the curb, my assistant Alex leaned over to pass me his iPad. 
"Boss, we have already announced that we will remove Ms. Rebecca from Luminary Productions. The chairman also called multiple times, asking for your presence." 
"Tell him I'm far too occupied with the Sci-Fi production team to be disturbed," I said, though we both knew it was a lie. 
"Understood!" Alex replied. 
My father hasn't changed one bit over the years; he'll blame me whenever something goes wrong in the company. Though his strategy now is different, he'll say it's my job as president to protect Luminary Productions. The company is still doing well, and my dad is doing everything he can to save it. But I no longer care. My stocks in different companies are doing well. 
*** 
Bronn invited me to attend the LoveLogic presentation for investors. I discreetly followed Sarah to the hotel, arriving after her group. Trey and Josh were my companions for this trip. 
"Find out where Sarah is," I instructed Josh, knowing his connections with Sarah. 
Shortly after, Trey delivered the update. "Boss, Josh just called in. He located Madam Sarah at the hotel bar. According to his report, she appears severely intoxicated," Trey relayed with a concerned furrow in his brow. 
"What?" My expression tightened. Wrapping up my tasks, I made my way to the bar where Sarah was. 
"Where is she?" I demanded, my eyes scanning the dimly lit room.  
They pointed to a barstool where Sarah was sitting, looking tired, and talking loudly with two showgirls wearing very revealing outfits that sparkled in the light. 
"Damn it! Why are you allowing Sarah to converse with strippers?" I rebuked Josh and Sarah's original bodyguard, who appeared concerned. 
"President Cornell, initially, I was monitoring the situation from a distance. However, when those two women approached Ms. Sarah, I stepped in. But Ms. Sarah got upset and sprayed pepper spray right in my face when I tried to separate them and stop her from drinking more." 
He paused, wiping his still-watering eyes. "I had to stay calm to avoid making a big scene, even though it hurt like crazy. I wanted to take her away forcefully, but I was worried I might accidentally hurt her since she was so drunk. Luckily, Josh showed up and took over so I could wash out my eyes. I guess Ms. Sarah's drunk because she didn't even recognize me." 
"Take him to the hotel clinic," I directed Josh with a sour expression. 
As I approached Sarah, I heard her speaking loudly and unclearly to the showgirls, venting her frustrations. 
"Do you know? Men are foolish! They're so foolish, they forget they'll inevitably hurt me!" Sarah exclaimed. 
One of the women, speaking in a Spanish-English accent, said, "I agree. You're beautiful; don't let men fool you... in our line of work, you'll rake in substantial earnings. Men will worship you like Aphrodite!" 
"Really?" Sarah responded, evidently intrigued. 
Frustration welled within me as Sarah seemed oblivious to the lure of the strippers. 
Another woman with the same accent elaborated, "Indeed! My husband, bless his soul, is weirdo, and has a small dick! In our job, sex is different. You'll feel different kinds of dick-small dick, big dick, ordinary dick, a dick that didn't sleep, a macho dick-every kind!" 
I was utterly dumbfounded. I never imagined women discussing such intimate matters so openly, and what on earth did she mean by "dick that didn't sleep"?  
With her unfocused gaze, Sarah pondered aloud, and it was amusing and perplexing how she managed to mimic the accent. 
"But I don't like dick! My husband-no dick!" she exclaimed, her words slurred. 
"That will be a big problem!" one of the showgirls exclaimed dramatically. 
"Exactly!" Sarah affirmed, downing her drink in one gulp. 
While I stood nearby, I felt extremely uncomfortable being talked about. I couldn't stay silent any longer, so I approached them. 
"Babe, it's time to stop drinking. Let's go," I urged, trying to intervene. 
"Hold on! Are you her husband?" a woman interjected, blocking Sarah from me. Her ample boobs bounced as she did so, and I felt too embarrassed to approach.  
"Yes, now get the fuck out of my way!" I snarled; my patience already thin due to Sarah's drunken state. 
But the women persisted, "No way! There are scary men lurking all over Vegas! Prove to us you're her husband! We won't just hand over this cute little lady to any random guy!" 
The other chimed in, "Maybe you're just using those handsome looks and charming ways to try and get this woman into your bed tonight!" 
"Didn't I tell you girls he's an idiot!" 
"So is he really your husband with 'no dick'?" The first asked with raised eyebrows. 
Sarah squinted at me for a long moment, her mind clearly struggling to process, before giving an absentminded nod. "Yeah That's right!" 
I gritted my teeth, struggling to keep my cool. It would take all my self-control to stay calm. 
One daring showgirl leaned in to pat my arm with a sympathetic look. "Hey, it's no biggie if your wife can't feel you down there, bro. The performance is what matters. You just gotta put in the effort to make sure she's still enjoying those special intimate moments..." 
"That's right," the other lady agreed. "Don't rely on that pretty face of yours-we ladies need a lot more than just looks to get there. Perform well on the bed; women will not cum just by looking at the face" 
Completely frustrated, I quickly took out my wallet and handed some money to the showgirl, hoping to stop the embarrassing conversation. 
"Here, take this for watching out my wife." 
To my surprise, Sarah embraced the two women gratefully, declaring her love for them amidst tears. 
"I love you girls!" 
I was left utterly speechless and exasperated! It was painfully obvious just how severely intoxicated she had become.
###chapter 89: Sudden Vow 
**Philip**  
"Come on now, let's get you back to your suite," I murmured, putting my arm around Sarah's waist to help her walk steadily.  
She sobbed uncontrollably, her cries deep and raw, as if she were saying a painful goodbye to her best friends. As I guided her unsteady steps out of the dimly lit bar, my heart ached with remorse at the sight of her suffering.  
"Shh, don't cry, babe... your pretty eyes will go red and puffy."  
"It's your fault! You hurt me. Why can't you love me? Why does no one like me?" She cried like a baby while we were in the hallway. Guests and hotel staff looked concerned.  
"I'm sorry, babe Come on I'll take you to your bed," I told her.  
"No, Philip! Why does everyone hurt me?" I could hear the pain in her voice. Even in her drunken state, she was carrying the weight of the pain I caused her.  
"Listen, babe Lying to you that night was the dumbest mistake of my life. But I was weak I did what I thought I had to. My mother keeps bothering you, and I couldn't take it anymore. I keep giving you heartache."  
She continued crying like a child. As I held her trembling body in my arms, I was struck by her fragrance, her warmth, her very essence-everything I had so foolishly thrown away. I couldn't believe how blind and idiotic I had been not to realize how precious she was until it was too late.  
Why did I let Sarah leave? Why did I ruin the life we could have had?  
I loved this woman with every fiber of my being... but my actions had taken away my right to tell her. I decided to become a better person, to earn wealth, power, and status-to be someone worthy of her love.  
"Philip hurt me so much in the past..." she whimpered brokenly, her tears dampening the fabric of my shirt as she clung to me. "He hurt me. No one has ever hurt me the way he did."  
I closed my eyes, feeling sorry, and hugged her tighter. Then, I gently kissed her on the forehead. "You will never be hurt because of me again, babe That's a promise!"  
A group of people dashed down the hallway, led by a stunning woman in a beautiful white dress. She was followed by a group of bridesmaids dressed in stylish black outfits. It seemed weddings were a frequent affair in this town.  
"Come on, guys! We're dreadfully late!" the woman, presumably the bride, exclaimed as she hurried past us.  
The woman at the back, who looked like she was in her early thirties, fixed us with a disapproving glare. "Hey, why are you still here? Hurry up! You have to follow the bride!" she scolded firmly.  
I contemplated correcting her, but Sarah darted forward. Her cheeks flushed with drunken glee as she trailed after the noisy wedding party.  
"Sarah, stop!" I called out in alarm. I worried she might stumble or worse.  
"No! I want to witness the wedding! Come on, let's go!" she insisted.  
Glancing at my watch, I remembered she had a presentation the following afternoon. Resigned, I tagged along, unwilling to see her disappointment.  
We were directed into a waiting limousine outside the hotel. Unsure whether to board, I paused, uncertain if it was wise, but Sarah rushed in before I could say anything. I couldn't leave her alone, so I reluctantly followed her into the fancy interior, bending down as I squeezed in.  
"Boss!" Trey called out, left behind in the commotion. "Damn it!"  
I surveyed the strangers in the limousine, all dressed in black. Then I looked at Sarah and myself. Our attire matched theirs perfectly.  
Damn! There seemed to be a misunderstanding. But I was too embarrassed to say anything, too ashamed to admit it now.  
"Hey, are you friends of the bride or the groom?" a woman asked, sensing we were the odd ones out.  
Sarah erupted into laughter. "Neither! We don't even know the bride or groom!"  
The occupants of the limousine exchanged glances before bursting into laughter themselves.  
"I never knew you could crack such hilarious jokes!" remarked one man.  
Embarrassed, My face burned, and I wished I could vanish into the comfortable leather seats. But when my gaze landed on Sarah, witnessing the shameless delight sparkling in her gray orbs, I couldn't help but shake my head with a resigned chuckle.  
I chuckled and surrendered to the group's infectious joy. They were super excited, singing loudly, dancing freely, and just having a wild time.  
Before we knew it, the car stopped outside Lovers' Haven Wedding Chapel. We were ushered inside and greeted by several couples waiting to exchange vows. It felt like everyone around us had caught the wedding bug, and many were eager to make their commitment official.  
I quickly informed Trey of our unexpected detour.  
As the ceremony unfolded, Sarah suddenly felt compelled to join the couples at the altar. She confidently approached the officiant or a minister of some sort.  
"Sir! You need to marry me to my husband right this instant!" Sarah insisted to the confused man, "This guy right here, he's my incredibly handsome husband! Please, you have to let us renew our vows right now!" Her words poured out rapidly, fueled by her drunken excitement.  
I shot an apologetic glance at the officiant.  
"Please don't listen to my wife, sir. She's quite intoxicated at the moment," I explained, gently pulling Sarah away. Though inwardly frustrated by her actions, I kept my cool outwardly. "Sarah, you're not thinking clearly"  
I winced, feeling acutely uncomfortable as I realized that every person in the chapel had turned their attention toward us.  
"I knew it! You don't love me!" Sarah cried out, her distress escalating.  
"Babe, please, let's calm down," I urged, sure she'd regret this outburst once she sobered up.  
The officiant took pity on the distressed woman. "Since you're already married, having another ceremony won't be a big deal," he reassured me kindly.  
This is one of those events where I struggle to define our 'situationship'. 
Encouragement came from others in attendance. "Come on, you're in Vegas! It would be a wonderfully memorable experience for a married couple!"  
I made one last weak attempt to object, reaching for any excuse I could find. "W-we don't even have rings," I blurted out, hoping it would suffice.  
But Sarah's heartbroken sobs continued to flow, drawing more unwanted attention.  
"Listen, just go ahead with it! Renewing your vows with your wife won't hurt. She's convinced you don't love her anymore, poor thing," the officiant urged, echoing the sentiments of the onlookers.  
"That's right!" More whispers of agreement backed up his position.  
I leaned in towards the officiant, whispering, "Is there any way we can do this unofficially? Just have a wedding ceremony?"  
I didn't want Sarah to get emotional, nor did I want anyone to suspect anything fishy.  
"Absolutely!" The officiant's grin stretched from ear to ear.  
The wedding proceeded, fulfilling the attendees' expectations. Sarah's face lit up with joy, and she clapped excitedly after it concluded. Her behavior seemed strange, almost overly enthusiastic. What could be prompting this unusual display?  
As Trey picked us up, my bodyguard was accompanied by Jakob, each in separate cars.  
"Sarah, I was really worried, looking everywhere for you! I checked into your suite, but you weren't there. Thankfully, I bumped into President Cornell's bodyguard. Why didn't you pick up your phone?" Jakob scolded.  
"Do not raise your voice at my wife," I interjected sternly  
"My apologies, President Cornell..." he muttered through gritted teeth.  
Sarah silently slipped into the car, closing her eyes as if wanting to take the world away. "I don't want to talk to you," she declared.  
Jakob clenched his jaw, visibly irritated.  
The officiant chose that moment to approach, eyeing the luxury vehicles idling at the curb. "Mr. Cornell? You haven't settled your bill for my services this evening."  
I inwardly cursed. Of course, the officiant probably pushed that ceremony to get a payment. Exhausted and frustrated, I rubbed my nose, realizing the night wasn't finished yet.  
"I'll handle it so that you can take Sarah back. She looks exhausted," Jakob offered.  
"Thank you," I muttered, realizing too late that I shouldn't have entrusted him.  
Back at the hotel, Sarah suggested hitting the casino. It seemed she had a sudden surge of energy when intoxicated.  
A lot of things happened after that! When morning arrived, I felt a surge of rage towards Jakob for registering our marriage license. How the hell did he pull that off?  
I don't fucking know!
###chapter 90: Sudden Vow 2 
**Sarah** 

When I woke up in my hotel room, my head felt unbearably heavy, like a massive stone weighing it down. I first noticed a large diamond ring on my left hand. Where on earth did I get this extravagant piece of jewelry? 
"Shit!" I murmured, holding my head as if it might explode. 
"Amanda!" I called for my nanny. "Amanda" I repeated, grimacing as a new wave of pain shot through my head. The room spun around me. 
The door burst open with a loud thud, and my faithful attendant Amanda quickly entered. 
"Miss!" She rushed to my side, helping me sit up. 
"God, what happened?" I cried out as the pain became too much to handle. Tears filled my eyes, and I sobbed loudly. 
There was a knock on the door, and my guard stood outside, wearing dark shades. "M-Miss Sarah, President Cornell has arrived." 
"What? He's here?" I couldn't believe Philip was at the hotel. Why was he here? 
"Yes, he brought the doctor who checked on you last night," the guard informed me. 
I blinked. Why can't I remember anything? 
Amanda explained, "They woke me up last night, Miss Sarah. I helped you take a bath and change into fresh clothes. We couldn't stop you from crying." 
"What?" My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. The last thing I remembered was being at the bar, drinking alone. 
"Should I let President Cornell in?" 
What is Philip doing here? That's what I want to know! 
"You need to see the doctor first, Ms. Sarah," Amanda suggested, noticing my confused expression. 
I nodded, massaging my throbbing head. 
Philip and the doctor entered, Philip's eyes locking onto mine with an intense, penetrating gaze. 
"I've called for breakfast to be sent up," Philip said calmly. 
What is happening? 
"Please check my wife" Philip addressed the physician. 
The doctor proceeded to examine me thoroughly-inspecting my eyes, taking my temperature, and having me stick out my tongue. Then he started asking about my symptoms, and I tried my best to answer, even though the pain made me cry even more. 
"I will give you another shot, Ms. Mitchell" 
"What? W-what is that for?" I stammered. 
"Sarah, last night... you were drugged," Philip's voice cut through the room, tinged with concern. "I couldn't stop you last night. You wanted to do so many things, so I called a doctor." 
"What?" My eyes widened. I glanced at the bodyguard by the door. I could feel his nervousness. It was negligence for both of us. 
Philip seemed to anticipate my silent inquiry. "You sprayed pepper spray at your bodyguard, preventing him from approaching you. Two strippers lured you. Jakob reviewed the surveillance footage; those women spiked your drink." 
"How... how could this happen?" I stammered. 
"You're here in the Las Vegas Strip, Ms. Mitchell. Unfortunately, different kinds of dangers are happening. I'm not implying that this is exclusive to our town. Dangers are everywhere, so you should be careful," the doctor cautioned. "This medication will help..." 
As the doctor prepared to administer the medication, he reassured, "President Cornell, I'll return tonight for another IV dose." 
Acknowledging the doctor's departure, my guard ushered him out. Just as I prepared to recline, my hand brushed against an unfamiliar object on the bed.  
"Ahhh! What is this?!" I exclaimed, casting an accusatory glance at Philip. 
"Babe, d-don't freak out..." Philip's voice quivered, his expression betraying his horror. 
He's wrong because it freaked me out even more!  
"What is this, Philip?" I demanded, waving the document. 
"Um... they... they registered our marriage," he confessed, trembling. "I-I'll call Jakob!" 
"Nooooo! You answer me now!" I yelled at him, hurling a pillow that narrowly missed his head. My senses were in overdrive from the adrenaline coursing through me. 
"Okay...Okay..." He held up his hands placatingly. "You need to calm down; getting worked up will only worsen things." He wiped his face with a shaky hand before continuing. "Last night, after I picked you up from the bar, a group ran into the hallway; they invited us to join their party. Then, we watched four wedding ceremonies. Then, after all the weddings happened...you demanded the officiant marry us too!" 
"And you didn't stop me?!" I exclaimed, incredulous. 
"Trust me, babe. I tried to stop you!" he stuttered. You wailed and complained to the officiant. People were looking at us. Then I asked the officiant if it was okay if we could do the ceremony unofficially. Trust me. I believe it was just an unofficial sham." 
Philip seemed increasingly anxious as he attempted to explain, but his words didn't match the proof I held. 
"But this doesn't make sense, Philip! This is definitely an officially registered marriage license!" I thrust the document at him accusingly. He jumped back as if it had burned him. 
"That was my mistake. Jakob was the one who helped register our wedding last night." 
"How did Jakob get involved in this?" I was incredulous, my head pounding, ready to explode. 
I snatched my phone and called Jakob immediately, demanding answers. 
"Hello?" He answered after several rings, his voice still husky with sleep. "Geez, Sarah... not again! Can't a guy get some rest?" 
"Come to my suite right now, Jakob!" I snapped. 
"Fine, fine!" he grumbled. 
Philip stood to the side, staring at me with a serious expression. We were all tense, waiting for Jakob to arrive. Room service and Jakob came together. Still in his pajamas, Jakob brought a glass of juice with him, looking very sleepy. 
"Why was our sham wedding registered last night?" I demanded before he could even settle into a chair. 
"What? Your wedding was supposed to be fake?" Jakob asked, appearing puzzled. 
Philip explained, "Jakob, you told me you would only settle the bill. We had an agreement with the chapel that it's unofficial. I-I just wanted Sarah to stop crying and go through with it for appearances." 
Jakob took a long sip of his juice and said, "I didn't know the full details. I sent you ahead because I thought Sarah was already sleepy. You didn't explicitly tell me to just pay the bill. It was required when the officiant asked for identification to finalize the paperwork. So, I casually provided your IDs, believing you had simply forgotten to give them to the chapel earlier." 
"I only asked you to settle the bill! And how did you even obtain our identification documents?" Philip's voice rose in exasperation. 
"You invested money in LoveLogic, President Cornell. Standard protocol is to keep copies of investors' IDs and passports on file for verification purposes." 
The realization hit me like a truck. "What? You invested in LoveLogic?" Now it made sense why Philip was here. Bronn invited him! "Jakob, what in the world were you thinking?" I exclaimed. 
"Anyway, if you don't need me anymore, I'll eat outside since you woke me up. I'll take this chance to enjoy a delicious meal!" Jakob left the room. 
"Let's all calm down, babe..." Philip muttered. "We can sort this out." 
"No! No one should know we were remarried, Philip! My grandfather and Amir will definitely kill me!" 
Philip fell silent... then he explained why I had a fancy ring on my finger.
###chapter 91: Velvet Agony 
**Sarah** 
I showed the ring to Philip. "And this ring? Hold on, don't tell me you bought this for me?" My eyes widened at the possible scenario playing out in my mind. 
"Uh, you got that ring from one of the players last night at the casino," Philip explained. 
I furrowed my brow, still not understanding what he meant.  
"Sarah, you invited me to the casino after we returned to the hotel. I wanted to call it a night because I felt tired after the incident at the chapel. We came straight here from Highland Hills... I couldn't stop you last night. You were incredibly energetic-like you had downed three energy drinks in a row. 
"I decided I had to keep an eye on you, so I followed you to the casino floor. And that's where you managed to obtain that ring from another gambler who had lost all her money. Sarah, it cost ten million dollars. According to the player you got it from, it came from an auction. A royal family owned it in the past," Philip explained. 
"You mean I got this ten-million-dollar ring overnight?" I couldn't believe it. 
"Not only that. You won twenty million dollars in cash, too." He swallowed hard.  
Looking closely at Philip, I felt a new distance between us. Since the last time we talked in Dubai, our playful banter seemed to disappear. It made me lonely because I had to admit, I missed Philip badly. 
I took off the ring. "Well, I don't think I'll need this jewelry. I'm not comfortable wearing a ring that someone else has used. I will donate this to a children's charity that I support, including the money I won last night." 
"You can do whatever you want; it's your money," he said. 
My head throbbed again. Touching my temple, I asked the question that had been weighing on me. "About the marriage... Why did you do it, Philip? You could have let me cry and be in the chapel even if I went wild there."  
Did this mean Philip was forced to do the wedding ceremony last night? 
"Sarah, I already promised you last night I wouldn't let you cry again..." he replied gently. 
"You did?" I was surprised. "W-we can file another divorce." I looked away. 
Philip clenched his fist. He exhaled slowly, then approached me and sat down on the edge of the bed. 
"What if I don't want to get a divorce?" His voice was soft but insistent. "Babe, I never wanted us to go through with the divorce. I know I messed up signing those papers. I've regretted it since I walked out on you at Serenity Pines." 
"But Philip, you hurt me so deeply back then. This remarriage with you-it terrifies me. I don't want to go through all that pain again" Tears streamed down my face as I sobbed, the fear of repeating past mistakes weighing heavily on my mind. 
Philip took my hand. "Sarah, I'll do everything I can to make it right. I'm not a perfect man by any means. But this second chance will be different because I love you..." His eyes shone with sincerity. 
"But you told me you didn't love me Philip, you don't intentionally hurt the person you claim to love..." I argued. 
He squeezed my hand tighter. "I know, babe I lied. Sarah, I have enemies-powerful enemies. I didn't want to drag you down into the dangers I face every day. I couldn't protect you. You almost died because of me" 
I gasped softly as memories of the incident in Highland Hills came flooding back. 
Philip pressed on. "When I followed you to your mansion in Dubai, Amir spoke to me You showed me your world, and I felt like I lost my mind; I was ashamed of myself. That's when I realized my shortcomings. I was ashamed of how my family treated you I was ashamed because I once accused you of being a gold-digger." 
My lips pressed into a thin line as I listened. 
"That's why I agree with you Let's keep last night's wedding a secret for now. I don't want a repeat of the pain and ugliness from before. So far, the only ones who know about us getting remarried are Jakob, Trey, and the chapel staff. Oh, and possibly those guests in the chapel. Jakob will monitor the internet to ensure nothing gets out about it." 
Philip gently wiped the tears from my cheeks. "Please, Sarah Please stay with me this time. Don't leave..." His voice trembled, a tear forming in his eye. 
"But I'm scared, Philip" 
"I'm scared too As much as I want to stay away from you to keep you safe from my mistakes, I can't I'll protect you no matter what. Even from those who want to harm you." 
I remained silent, needing time to consider Philip's plea. I was overwhelmed with fear. 
Emotionally and physically drained, I lay back on the bed and closed my eyes.  
"I'll wake you up later," Philip murmured. "Bronn has already been informed about the incident at the bar." 
He held my hand as I drifted off, exhaustion finally pulling me into sleep despite my lingering unease. 
*** 
Four hours later, the doctor returned to administer another IV shot. Philip was engrossed in some tasks, and Amanda was busy serving me a plate of food. At that moment, while I picked up my meal, Jakob strode into the suite without any announcement. 
"Why are you here?" I asked icily. 
"Doll, you can't be serious about being mad at me. I'm just here for the meal!" Jakob replied nonchalantly. 
This rascal! This explained why I'd always thought he was penniless! He regularly grabbed food and drinks, assuming he was entitled to complimentary coffee or a meal. When things were free, he was first in line, but if he had to pay, he turned into a tightwad who needed to be pinched for every penny. 
Jakob settled into a chair and began transferring delicious pastries onto his plate. 
"That's mine!" I snapped, snatching the strawberry tart and his entire plate. 
"You're so stingy!" he complained. 
"You won't eat until you explain yourself!" I demanded. 
"Okay... where should I begin?" Jakob said, eyeing the food hungrily. 
"Don't play dumb, Jakob!" I scolded. 
"Alright, alright! So, as you know, Bronn and I are not alike. I'm more of an introverted guy. That's why you and I never really crossed paths before. I avoided family gatherings-I preferred sleeping or zoning out with video games!" 
"You mean lazy activities!" I interjected. 
He shrugged. "During college, we were both into online schooling. To clear things up, I had no idea you were Bronn's ex-fiancée until last year when you returned to Grandpa Mitchell's," he explained. He couldn't resist the temptation of the delicious bread. Grabbing it from the plate, he took a big bite and chewed loudly.  
I let him indulge it.  
"Why didn't you tell me the truth? I thought your family was struggling financially. I thought you were so eager to sell a lot of security software and create LoveLogic because you wanted to follow Bronn's success in business!" I pressed. 
"Look, doll, I did want to follow Bronn! He inherited the family empire from our grandfather. I got into this business because of them," Jakob admitted. 
"And you're not jealous?" I asked Jakob skeptically. 
"Do I need to be jealous? All I know is that I'm enjoying myself!" 
That was one of the reasons why Jakob and I got along so well-we were both pretty carefree people who didn't worry much about the world revolving around us. 
"What about Emily? You hid her identity from me to protect Bronn! I feel betrayed!" I huffed, taking an aggressive bite of the strawberry tart out of frustration. 
"About that... I had no idea at first. When you asked me about Emily, I was surprised by the name." 
I remember Jakob even double-checked the name Amir gave. 
"I told Bronn that I found her that very time when you told me about it." 
"Ohhh. so that is the reason why he's out of character." I met Bronn at the hotel, where I introduced Jane to him, and clearly, he wasn't behaving properly. 
Jakob continued. "Bronn and I agreed that he would be the one to fill you in because I had an idea that you might get hurt. Anyway, there's something about Emily that she keeps secret, and I couldn't tell Bronn because I wanted you to understand the full context of their relationship first." 
"Oh, how wonderful!" I said sarcastically. "So, just because you kept something from Bronn, you think I'd be thrilled?" 
"No! It's not like that; it's just that your situation with the three of you is complicated. But now, I can finally say this won't affect you because you're married again to President Cornell!" 
"And I wanted to hit you because of it!" I gritted my teeth at the memory. 
But when Jakob told me Emily's secret, I was shocked.
###chapter 92: Unspoken Knowledge 
**Sarah** 

Jakob grinned broadly, prompting me to fight the urge to smack my fist into his annoying face. 
"Sarah, I first met you when you married President Cornell years ago. I watched as your life fell apart, seeing you return to Grandpa Mitchell with eyes void of life and then going back to President Cornell again. You told me you couldn't even summon anger toward him. You loved him deeply. Moreover, despite everything, he loved you too." 
Part of me wanted to believe that Philip loved me sincerely. But another part stayed cautious, afraid to risk that level of pain and betrayal again if I turned out to be wrong about his feelings. 
"He wouldn't have let his mother face public scrutiny like that, revealing her crimes and manipulation after all these years, if he didn't still have strong feelings for you deep down," Jakob continued. 
Silence hung between us as we ate pastries. The thought of marriage to Philip again gave me a headache. 
Changing the subject, I asked Jakob, "So, what was the secret you uncovered about Emily?" 
"Emily has a child," he stated matter-of-factly. 
I gasped, my eyes widening in shock. "What?" 
He nodded. "I was surprised too when I found out during my investigation into Emily. I'm not well-versed in female cycles, and how pregnancy happens, but from what I could piece together, there is a high likelihood that Bronn is the father, given their history." 
"So, my suspicions were correct. Emily distanced herself from Bronn because of her feelings for your brother," I murmured. 
Jakob shrugged his shoulders. 
Reflecting on my situation, I once asked Philip about divorce because I wanted to protect our unborn child from growing up in a marriage without love. But in the end, I couldn't shield our baby from the harsh truth of our circumstances. 
"Find Madam Cornell for me, Jakob. Use the facial recognition app or whatever means necessary," I instructed.  
Philip had taken the first step, but Madam Cornell had escaped. I'll make sure I'm the one to track the woman down finally. 
"I wanted to use the LoveLogic app to locate Madam Cornell, but we have no chance if she won't use it. Besides, the app isn't suitable for someone her age," Jakob explained. 
That was when another thought struck me. "That's right!" 
Jakob looked at me with a puzzled expression. "What is it?" 
"I just remembered hearing she might have been involved with one of the executives at Aspire Financial Group," I clarified. "I saw her at their building once, and the president mentioned Madam Cornell often visited a specific executive's office. So, there's a good chance we might see her with this man." 
"Are you going to tell your husband about this?" Jakob asked. 
I shook my head decisively. "No, I'd rather not involve Philip."  
We fell silent again, nibbling on our pastries while Jakob went on discussing possible uses for the LoveLogic app data. 
After a while, my guard approached us. 
"Miss, there's a new visitor for you," he announced. 
In surprise, I saw Emily awkwardly standing in the doorway, peering into the room. I quickly stood up. 
"Oh, Emily! Please, come in! What a terrible boss I'm being! I'm so sorry if I forgot to message you. I just woke up. Have you eaten? Would you like to join the meal?" I asked quickly. 
"It's alright. I've set up the executive room we rented and coordinated with Mr. Martin's assistant since this morning for the presentation. I also heard about the incident last night, so I have an idea of what happened to you. I came here to see if you're alright I'm really sorry about last night." 
"It's fine," I assured her; I had no right to be angry at her either. 
To my surprise, Jakob decided to cut right to the chase, his blunt question catching me completely off guard. "Is Bronn the father of your child?" 
I choked on the water I was about to drink. This rascal! He asked Emily as casually as if he were asking if she'd had lunch! Without thinking, I reached over and smacked him on the head. 
"You're such an idiot! That's probably why you're perpetually single- you're completely incapable of reading situations and understanding women at all!" 
Jakob looked utterly pitiful, rubbing his now sore head. "Ow! I'm so mistreated in our little team here. I do all the work and put in all the effort, and I'm still the one who ends up physically assaulted. It's so unfair!" He shook his head mournfully.  
Looking at Emily, horror was written across her pale face, her eyes widening in sheer panic. She didn't know whether to be angry or terrified at what she had just heard. 
"You... you found out?" she stammered. 
"Emily, please, calm down," I urged, trying to steady her. 
"Shit" She couldn't sit still. "What am I supposed to do? Does Bronn know about this? Please... please don't tell him!" Tears streamed down her pale cheeks, overwhelmed by anxiety. 
It was almost ironic that I, the one urging her to calm down and offering her a seat, was the one suffering panic attacks. Handing her a glass of water, I tried to soothe her, but the fear that we knew her secret continued to haunt her. 
Jakob, the insensitive idiot, unintentionally made things worse. "So, Bronn really is your daughter's father! That's fantastic!" 
I smacked Jakob's head again in frustration. "Damn it, Jakob! You're not helping! Please, leave my suite for now!" 
I felt like an enraged dragon protecting its lair. The clueless fool was utterly stunned by his thoughtless words and my anger. 
"Amanda, bring my gun!" I called Amanda, who was in the adjacent room preparing my things for the afternoon. 
"Geez! Okay, okay, I'm going!" Jakob didn't leave empty-handed, though, grabbing a plate of pastries and a pitcher of orange juice as his parting consolation prize. 
Once Jakob had left, I turned back to Emily.  
"Sarah, please... don't tell Bronn. What if he tries to take my daughter away? I-I can't lose her." 
"Emily, calm down," I said gently, doing my best to reassure her. "You don't need to worry about me. The information didn't come from me, and I'll make sure Jakob doesn't say anything to Bronn either..." 
Emily sobbed quietly. 
"But you need to tell him about your daughter," I insisted. I didn't know if Bronn would accept the truth, but I knew keeping it hidden wasn't the answer. 
"Wh-when I found out you were Miss Benner, I was terrified. There's a slim chance I can keep my daughter a secret if I work closely with Bronn. That's the real reason why I decided to resign at first..." She paused to wipe her tears. 
"But when you offered me those incentives and opportunities for high-paying projects under you, I decided to stay. My family isn't wealthy, Sarah. I have a nanny caring for my little girl, and I desperately need the extra money to provide for her. That's also why you persuaded me so hard not to leave" 
I felt a pang of envy towards Emily. Her situation reminded me sharply of the sacrifices I couldn't make for my own baby. 
"I won't tell anyone your secret, Emily. Don't worry. But now I was hoping you could help me. I want to know which executive Madam Cornell visits and keeps appointments at Aspire..." 
I'll make sure to find Madam Cornell.
###chapter 93: If Only I Could  
**Sarah** 

Jakob and I successfully presented our LoveLogic app to the investors, despite Philip staring directly and intently at me while I was explaining how the app works and the current generation's deep interest in it.  
Philip's gaze made my insides burn with an inexplicable heat as if he wanted to devour me right there. It felt like his very breath was caressing every fiber of my being. However, I mustered the discipline to ignore him for the time being and focus on the task at hand. 
We told the investors that our virtual dating app will have a soft launch in major app stores next week, allowing some users an early try. The full-scale release event is planned for next month. Jakob and I emphasized this timing, which works well since Jane will have completed Bronn's non-player character AI by then. 
After the presentation, Emily approached me looking uneasy.  
In a hushed tone, she asked, "Sarah, can I please return to my home in Highland Hills tonight?" 
Concerned, I replied, "Did something happen?" 
"It's just that... my daughter," she said, looking at me directly. I didn't want to discuss her child there. 
So, I simply said, "I hope everything is alright." 
"She's fine. I'm just homesick." 
I smiled at her. "It's fine, Emily. I'll have my guard take you." 
"No need. I-" 
Bronn approached us, noticing the serious conversation. "Is there a problem?" 
I didn't hesitate to ask for his help. "Can you take Emily to the airport?" It was nine o'clock at night, and I didn't want my assistant to be in any danger. 
"Sarah, I'm fine. I'll just call a taxi to take me to the airport," Emily insisted. I sensed she was tense about my offer, possibly wanting to avoid Bronn. 
Fortunately, Bronn was persistent. "No, I'll take you." 
After they left, Philip appeared by my side. His earlier look still had me flustered, and my heart raced when he asked, "Can I invite you to dinner?"  
I hadn't yet fully recovered from the intense feelings stirred by Philip's earlier gaze. To steady my emotions, I glanced at my friend Jakob, deeply engaged in conversation with another investor across the room. I had planned to invite Jakob to a celebratory dinner to mark our successful pitch.  
"I'll be leaving tonight, Sarah," Philip said, redirecting my attention away from Jakob. 
"Oh! Where are you going?" I asked, turning to him. 
"I have a race to attend in Europe the day after tomorrow. I-I was hoping we could spend some time together before I leave." 
"Can I join?" I surprised myself with my own words. 
Philip's smile slowly disappeared, "No! I-I mean, I know you have a lot to do this week, including the preparation for the LoveLogic app launch." 
He was right, but I sensed another reason. While it had been a while since I last attended a racing event, that alone didn't feel like a sufficient reason to suddenly decide against participating. I needed to inform Amir about potentially joining the race and coordinate with my support team. However, I was eager to try and attend Philip's race as a spectator. 
Linking my arm with Philip's, I silently agreed to his offer and let him lead me wherever he wanted to go. 
We stepped into the elevator car, the tension between us thick despite the presence of Philip's guards Trey and Josh. 
As we walked down the hallway, Jakob called, but I ignored it and sent a message instead: 
***Me:*** *I'm with Philip for dinner. Catch you later!* 
Philip's group stopped in front of a door. He turned to Trey and Josh. "The two of you can rest for now. I'll leave Josh with Sarah. Trey, prepare your things; we'll be leaving tonight." 
I smiled at the guards as the suite door swung open, revealing a surprisingly romantic scene inside. A small table was positioned in the middle of the room, surrounded by the flickering glow of numerous electronic candles, adorned with a tempting array of food. 
"Wow! This is amazing, Philip!" I exclaimed. But when I looked at him, he was staring at me intensely. 
Philip slowly reached out, brushing a stray lock of hair away from my neck before leaning in to inhale deeply along the exposed skin. I felt a shudder run through me at the sensation, my pulse quickening. 
"Philip" 
"I'm sorry I've been missing your scent," he murmured huskily, his lips grazing my shoulder. 
"I've been missing your kisses..." I confessed in a heated whisper before I could stop myself. 
His eyes darkened with unrestrained desire, and he couldn't resist pressing his lips to mine. I responded eagerly, our mutual hunger evident in our kiss. 
He cleared the food off the table so I could sit there. A mix of need, longing, and ache surged through me 
His lips fervently met mine, sparking a yearning to delve deeper into the kiss while my hands explored his broad chest. 
"You looked absolutely stunning at that presentation, Sarah," Philip murmured against my neck, his tongue tasting my skin. "I always told myself I wanted to claim what's mine" His thumb brushed over my lips. "Are you mine, Sarah? Maybe I'm going mad thinking that It hurts to think you might not be" 
Philip scooped up a waiting panna cotta with his fingers and fed it to me, the act surprisingly erotic. A stirring sensation ignited in my stomach as I licked his fingers, locking eyes with him. 
His breath hitched, a soft groan escaping his lips as though he savored my response to the sweet treat. When he withdrew his fingers, he kissed me deeply once more. 
Lost in the moment, Philip lifted me effortlessly from the table and guided me to a nearby sofa. With tender care, he seated me, his palm slipping beneath the flowing fabric of my dress. 
I felt his warm breath against my skin as his hand traced my thighs. 
"I wish it were easy to forget, Sarah So you wouldn't have to hurt anymore," he murmured, my black underwear sliding down to my knees as he spoke. "I wish I could take away all your pain I wish I had done better so you wouldn't have been hurt in the first place" 
He held up the black underwear in his palm. He sniffed it as if gathering courage before proceeding. 
Philip's eyes reflected longing and sadness. What had happened to him? 
Before I could utter a word, he shifted my position. In an instant, his lips touched the most sensitive nerves within my core, causing my moans to roam inside his suite. His tongue alone sent a thousand pleasures coursing through my body. With each stroke, waves of ecstasy surged through me, overwhelming my senses.
###chapter 94: Inclination to Danger 
**Sarah** 

"Philip!" His name escaped my lips in a breathless gasp as waves of ecstasy crashed over me, reaching their crescendo. 
"Sarah..." Philip spoke in a husky voice, rough with spent passion. Our eyes met, his dark to my molten gray, still charged with the aftershocks tingling through me. But then my stomach rumbled loudly, breaking the intimate silence and shattering the spell between us. 
My cheeks grew warm as I couldn't help but burst into giggles. Philip's broad smile showed his affection. 
I curled up on the couch, longing for his smile. He nuzzled against me, peppering tender kisses along my collarbone as his rough palm lovingly stroked my flushed cheek. 
"Haven't you eaten yet?" he asked me. 
"I have" Jakob and I had snacks in my suite, but I grew tired from explaining the presentation. "Anyway, you have a trip tonight too..." 
Philip took my hand, brushing featherlight kisses across my knuckles. 
"Are you sure I can't come with you?" I asked.  
His face turned serious as he shook his head. Philip pulled me close, wrapping his strong arms around me to prevent further questions. His masculine scent enveloped me, reminding me of him. He led me to a cozy dining area and seated me on a soft cushion. 
"What would you like?" Philip asked, eyeing the food. 
"Hmmm... I want some of those blueberries and chocolate," I replied.  
He arranged a small plate with the juicy indigo orbs and sumptuous chocolate biscuits, placing it in front of me. Philip's smoldering gaze pierced me and I cleared my scratchy throat to calm my heart down.  
"I want to thank you for investing in Jakob's project. Isn't Luminary Production still having issues? Won't Chairman Cornell question you?" I asked curiously as I sipped my wine. 
"If I'm asked, I'll simply answer, 'I just supported my wife,'" he replied calmly. 
His words made my cheeks flush. I continued eating while Philip watched me, occasionally sipping his wine. 
Soon, the doorbell rang again. Philip went to answer it, revealing Trey outside. 
"Boss, it's time. We'll be late for the flight," Trey announced. 
"Give me five minutes," Philip replied before closing the door. 
When he returned, regret was evident on his face. 
"You're leaving?" I asked. 
Philip nodded. 
"Okay..." 
He gently held my face in his big, warm hands. "I'll see you soon, my love..." 
'My love...' 
As those words escaped his lips, my heart fluttered with joy. And so, we sealed our farewell with a tender, lingering kiss 
*** 
When Philip left, I called for Josh. I couldn't stop worrying about Philip's trip. I hadn't seen any lists of races happening in Europe, so where exactly was Philip going?  
I began to suspect that Philip might have another job for Mariano and used the trip as an excuse with me. Josh, being one of Mariano's informants within Philip's team, must know more. Since he already involved me in their affairs, I decided to seize this opportunity to find out what was going on. 
"Miss, Josh has arrived and is waiting outside," my guard informed me. 
"Please let him in," I replied. 
Josh entered the suite, having already been friends with my guard after the incident the other night. He hadn't even taken a seat before asking about my condition. We couldn't speak freely when Philip was around. 
"How are you? Does your head still hurt?" he asked. 
I shook my head. "No, after those IV treatments, the pain has subsided for now." 
"I don't understand why trouble always seems to find you," he said, shaking his head. 
I shot him an annoyed glare. "I'm only human, you know! I get hurt sometimes, and I need to vent my frustrations. Besides, I had my guard there with me." 
"Tsk! Who was nearly blinded after you sprayed him with pepper spray? Good thing your guard is patient. If I hadn't gone to the bar, he wouldn't be here." 
"Stop scolding me, okay? I called you here to discuss Philip, not lecture me. Does Mariano have anything to do with Philip's sudden departure?" 
Josh's face soured. "I just commented on your inclination to dangerous situations, and now you're actively seeking out more potential danger." 
This is exactly why I can't feel any danger from Josh. He acts like an overbearing doctor. 
"Come on! I'm just curious! I wanted to watch his race. I'm not planning to join the competition." 
I could see Josh holding back his annoyance. "Fine! Since I know I can't stop your persistence in this matter, I'll tell you!" 
I grinned initially, but my smile gradually faded as Josh revealed the disturbing truth. 
"Mariano told your husband he had to force you to join the race that happened two weeks ago. It's clear President Cornell didn't want you involved in Mariano's schemes, and now Mariano isn't pleased your husband didn't follow his lead. Unfortunately, this is the second time President Cornell has defied him. We already know Mariano punishes those who don't comply." 
I was momentarily stunned as I pieced together what had happened. 
"What was the first instance of him not following orders?" I asked Josh, nervous it might also involve me. "Wait, is this related to what happened last month? The incident at Highland Hills?" 
"That's right!" Josh confirmed. "Mariano killed his assistant after the assistant instructed his men to kill you, Sarah. You must realize by now that Mariano has an inexplicable fondness for your husband. President Cornell often acts on Mariano's behalf in business transactions. It seemed the assistant didn't like President Cornell." 
"Oh, so that must be why I was being tailed by that suspicious white van last month. T-then, Philip intervened." 
I trembled as I realized everything. I now understood Philip's change after our talk in Dubai and why he wanted to keep our sudden marriage in Las Vegas a secret. 
"President Cornell didn't want to invite you in this race because he knows it's dangerous," Josh added. 
"That's another thing I don't understand. I checked all the major racing schedules and couldn't find any legitimate events happening in Europe soon." 
Josh looked at me as if I had three heads. 
My face turned serious. "Admit it, Josh what is Philip's punishment for disobeying Mariano this time?" 
Josh hesitated before replying in a grave tone, "This race, Sarah. You won't find any details because it's an illegal street racing event. Forcing President Cornell to compete is his punishment." 
Shit!
###chapter 95: Burnt Evidence 
**Sarah** 

After hearing Josh's news, I couldn't sit still. A whirlwind of thoughts and emotions consumed me. I tried contacting Philip, desperate to ensure he was okay, but I didn't mention that I knew about his plans. I didn't want to worry him. 
My feelings were in turmoil over what to do. I was exasperated that Philip was doing this outrageous stunt because of me! He should have just asked me to join the race! But I couldn't just act and ruin his plan now. Other people were relying on me as well. 
I forced myself to ignore Philip while monitoring the stock market until my group passed by Serenity Pines Estate. I saw the woman again-the one I'd noticed when Jane and I went to Azuré's shop. 
"Please stop the van!" I commanded the driver. 
"Miss?" He looked puzzled but complied. 
He stopped the vehicle at the estate where Philip and I lived. Amanda looked confused. I exited and stared up at the imposing wrought-iron gates. The woman noticed me, her eyes widening in fear before she turned and sprinted away. 
'What is wrong with this woman?' 
I signaled Josh to chase her. The woman didn't get far before he caught up to her. 
"Let go of me! I'll report you to the police for hurting me!" she yelled as Josh dragged her back towards me. 
I approached the disheveled woman. "Who are you? You've been frequently loitering and watching my villa. What business do you have here?" 
"Your villa? Are you President Cornell's wife?" She looked me over. 
I refused to confirm or deny her assumption. "Remember, I can report you to the police for trespassing. Now, what were you doing lurking outside my Serenity Pines? Do you need something?" 
She trembled with fear at my words. To my surprise, she suddenly dropped to her knees before me pleadingly.  
"M-Miss, please...you have to help me!" She gulped with unshed tears. "My sister worked as a housekeeper at the Cornell mansion. She sent me a message saying she needed help, and then...then I never heard from her again. I just learned she died in a terrible fire." 
Josh and I exchanged looks. 
I steeled myself even though I felt pity for her. Losing a family member is painful. "If your sister worked at the Cornell mansion, why have you been coming here and spying on my home?" 
Tears welled up in her eyes, spilling down her cheeks as she continued crying uncontrollably. "I expected you might help me. My sister mentioned you several times. She said she felt sorry for you because Madam Cornell and Ms. Megan always mistreated and slandered you behind your back. I want to get justice for her death!" 
Her words felt like a punch to the gut. How ironic that this troubled woman was pleading with me to help her obtain justice when I hadn't found any justice for myself. 
Josh noticed my labored breathing and gently supported my back to keep me from collapsing. "Calm down," he whispered. Then he turned to the woman. "Listen, why exactly do you feel you need to seek justice?" 
"Didn't they say the fire was intentional? Ms. Megan blamed President Cornell's wife, but I know the truth. In the days before the fire, my sister sent me messages. She had discovered something significant on the night of the fire, something that might be the reason she... she died in those flames." Her face crumpled as fresh tears sprang forth. 
Josh and I exchanged a weighted look before he prompted, "And what did she discover?"  
"A c-couple visited Ms. Megan's villa," she stuttered, "and my sister was the one who met them at the door. They claimed to be Ms. Megan's birth parents. They...they claimed to be Ms. Megan's real biological parents. And they demanded money from her to keep their identities a secret and not cause trouble!" 
She shakily pulled out her phone, thumbing through it to find the message and showing it to me. It read: 'Ms. Megan's birth parents arrived at the villa and insisted on staying here! I thought Ms. Megan's family was supposed to be wealthy, and they even said they were on a cruise. I heard them arguing, and then, the couple left after getting some money!' 
"I never spoke to her again after that," the woman continued. "I showed this to the police because I strongly feel it's impossible my sister got caught in the fire at the villa. My sister was a light sleeper; she would have woken up immediately. But the investigators told me this can't be used." 
I looked at Josh, uncertain if he knew anything about Megan's true identity. He seemed indifferent. Regardless of whether this new information was accurate, one thing was clear: Josh had also been deeply hurt by Megan's lies and manipulations. 
"Is Megan still inside?" I inquired Josh. 
Josh remained stoic, but his eyes darkened, betraying his emotions. "I'm not sure. From what I understand, Boss Philip had already asked her to leave because she was overstaying. Besides, he hasn't been here much since returning from Dubai. He practically lives at Luminary Productions' office." 
The iron gate of Serenity Pines swung open slowly, probably triggered by the cameras spotting us near the tall perimeter wall. 
"Madam Sarah!" a guard exclaimed in surprise upon seeing me. 
To my knowledge, five guards were assigned to watch over Megan. 
"Where's Megan?" I demanded. 
"S-she's inside the main residence, ma'am," the guard stuttered, clearly uncomfortable. 
"Call the police!" I instructed Josh. I was still under investigation after Megan accused me of burning down her villa. Glancing at the woman, I added, "And you, you're not to leave this place, are we clear?" 
I strode past them and entered the premises. The guards followed, alongside the nervous brunette, whose name I had yet to learn. 
Inside, I spotted Megan lounging comfortably with a green clay mask adorning her face, engrossed in a large television. 
"Well, isn't this quite the cozy setup, someone squatting in someone else's home," I remarked. 
"You-! What are you doing here?" she snapped, rising from the couch. 
"I'm here to expose your lies, Megan! You set fire to your own villa so you could move into Serenity Pines," I declared with a smirk. 
The guards stayed perfectly motionless, their faces betraying no emotion. 
Megan let out a dramatic gasp, clapping her hands together. "Sarah, who in their right mind burns down their own house? You're the one suspected of burning down my villa out of jealousy and malice! I've had to rely on Philip's kindness and stay in this humble place because of what you did!" 
I gave a hollow chuckle. "Hmm... and you think I'm unaware of your actions? Let's review why purposely destroying your own property works entirely to your benefit: Firstly, your villa was fully insured, so you anticipate a substantial payout once it's proven you're innocent of starting the fire. Secondly, you're free to stay here at Serenity Pines Estate, under the belief that you'll be living with Philip. 
"Third, you're obviously trying to blame me by using our complicated history with Philip. And finally, you orchestrated the death of your maid in the fire; she knew the truth about your manipulative nature. Her testimony could have exposed the real you!" 
Megan's ruby-painted lips trembled slightly as the blood drained from her face. 
"You are annoying, meddlesome bitch!" she screamed, her eyes burning with undisguised hatred as she closed the distance between us.
###chapter 96: The Alibi's Web 
**Sarah** 
Megan's plan of attack was swift and reckless. She lunged at me, hands outstretched towards my neck in an attempt to strangle me. But Josh saw it coming and swiftly intervened, grabbing her wrists and pulling her away. 
"You're nothing but a hindrance in my life!" Megan shouted, her face contorted with rage. "What do you really have, huh? No matter what you do, Philip will never love you! Never! He pities you because your innocent baby died!" 
My jaw clenched at her words. Of all the cruel things Megan could have said, mentioning the death of my unborn baby was the worst. Fury boiled inside me as I stepped closer and slapped her hard across the face. 
Megan trembled with rage, holding her reddened cheek. "Y-you-! I will kill you!" 
I met her fury with a dark stare until she looked away. Grabbing her chin, I squeezed it. "You still don't get it. The authorities are looking for Madam Cornell because Dr. Smith implicated my mother-in-law. But they don't know yet that you were an accomplice involved in what happened to me. What do you think will happen if I reveal to them your role?" 
I flicked her red cheek with disdain. Megan's eyes widened in fear as she realized how much trouble she was in. 
"Impossible! Y-you won't be part of the complaint! W-what about Philip? You're an evil woman! That's your mother-in-law, and you're going to let her go to jail? You're a demon! You have no gratitude!" she shouted. 
Once again, my palm struck her cheek. I was trembling with fury at this vile woman who had the nerve to blame me for their evil deeds as if I were at fault. 
"That still doesn't justify what you did, hurting my innocent baby!" I roared. "Do you still not get it, Megan?" 
We heard tires screeching, and a plain-looking vehicle pulled up outside Serenity Pines Estate. The security guard assigned to monitor the gate announced, "Miss, the investigator is outside." 
I saw the anxiety in Megan's eyes as she looked from the guard to me. "Wh-Why did you call the authorities?" 
Instead of answering her verbally, I grabbed Megan firmly by the arm and began forcibly dragging her toward the door. She struggled against my grip, nearly losing her balance as I pulled her along. 
"Let go of me!" she shouted, her carefully applied facial mask slipping tilted during the struggle. 
Outside the villa's wide door, the two investigators who had previously interviewed me after Megan's house burned down appeared surprised. Without hesitation, I shoved the stubborn woman towards them, causing her to stumble down the short stairs. 
Megan struggled until one of the investigators caught her in his arms. But she quickly pulled herself away as if she might catch a contagious illness from him. 
"I want to know the current status of your investigation into the fire at Ms. Megan Thompson's villa," I stated firmly to the two men. 
" Ms. Mitchell, we have apprehended another household helper who was attempting to flee the country. She has confessed to being the instigator; stealing your clothing to use as a disguise and later conspiring with the group that burned down Ms. Thompson's villa. She admitted to everything," one of the investigators explained. 
Megan smirked smugly as if she had found a way to outsmart me again. I wasn't sure what trick she had pulled off, but I was determined to uncover the truth behind her actions. 
"Another helper died in the fire. Did you find it odd that only Ms. Thompson survived?" I challenged them. 
Megan scoffed loudly. "Look at her! She's practically eager to see me burn in that fire, too! I've been telling you she's behind this, all so she could have Philip!" 
The two officers regarded me suspiciously, but I chose not to engage further. In reality, the text messages the woman showed me weren't sufficient to prove Megan started the fire, even though other evidence firmly pointed to her guilt. 
Standing my ground, I turned to address the private guard. "Well, she has been overstaying at my villa against my wishes! I've been trying to remove her for a long time, but she is extremely persistent. Get that woman out of my home immediately. And get all her belongings out as well-Every. Single. Item!" 
They followed the instruction. It's fortunate they recognize who's in charge now that my husband is overseas. 
Megan shook with anger, her face red with fury as she looked around at the chaotic scene. The disturbance at the grand villa caught the interest of nearby residents, who watched curiously and whispered about the police being there. Megan's immense pride wouldn't let her endure such public embarrassment. 
"You can't do this! You and Philip are separated already! He allowed me to stay here in Serenity Pines. He's the only one who can evict me!" She shouted angrily with trembling lips. 
Arms crossed, I retorted firmly, "Serenity Pines Estate belongs solely to me! Whether Philip agreed to let you stay here or not doesn't matter. I'm the rightful owner, and I make the decisions. Now, pack your things and leave my villa!" 
Within moments, three burly guards emerged carrying boxed and bagged belongings.  
"Madam Sarah, here are all her belongings," one of them reported. 
I tossed them one by one while Megan scrambled to gather them, appearing like a distressed beggar, while bystanders beyond the open gate watched. She was humiliated and powerless. 
"Can't anyone help me?" she pleaded with the authorities. 
"This is a private matter, Ms. Thompson. Moreover, Ms. Mitchell accuses you of trespassing. If Ms. Mitchell owns this residence, our hands are tied," one of them responded. 
Megan's face twisted with disbelief and seething rage as she turned to me. "You shameless bitch! This isn't over! I'll make you pay for humiliating me. Philip will realize his mistake and return it to me. Just wait!" 
"In addition to the trespassing, Ms. Thompson has repeatedly made false accusations that I set fire to her villa on numerous occasions. I wish to file a restraining order against her; she is causing me significant distress! Is that possible?" I inquired of the authorities. 
The two officers exchanged looks before the taller one nodded. "That is possible, Ms. Mitchell." 
"No! You can't do this!"  
A guard drove her luxurious vehicle out of the indoor parking until it stopped in front of the wide door where we were. 
Megan trembled as she hastily loaded her disheveled belongings into the car. "We're not finished, Sarah! Philip is definitely mine!" 
"Yeah, sure," I muttered, rolling my eyes at her single-minded obsession with Philip. What an unhinged woman! 
Megan had just sped away in her car after taking the driver's seat. 
"Call the villa cleaner! I don't want that woman leaving any stains here," I instructed. 
The sister of the helper who died in the fire at Megan's villa came up to me. She had seen everything that happened but wasn't happy with how things turned out.  
"What about my sister? Isn't Ms. Megan going to be held accountable?" she asked. 
"I'm really sorry. You have seen everything that dramatic happened here. Don't worry, I'll find evidence to press charges against her." 
I could face trouble if I get involved in the ongoing official investigation. I need to speak with another helper who admitted to being a suspect in the fire. 
I spent two days busy with work until Assistant Alex brought me bad news early in the morning. 
He had rushed over to Amir's villa, looking distraught. Jane and I enjoyed the delicious food Amanda had prepared in the dining area when Alex delivered the devastating update. 
"Madam Sarah, we can't find the boss's whereabouts. He He was lost on the Transfagarasan Highway." 
I froze, the blood draining from my face as Jane audibly gasped beside me. Philip had recklessly joined an illegal street race to that notorious destination! 
I knew it! I couldn't hold back my tears. "Bring me to Romania immediately! I have to go find him!" I declared. 
"Miss Sarah!" Amanda objected in a worried voice. Jane pulled me into a comforting embrace as she, too, began to weep. 
"I'm sorry, Madam, but I can't..." Alex replied firmly. "You can't leave Highland Hills. I promised the boss that I would ensure you remained safely here no matter what." 
'What?' 
Alex immediately gave orders to all the guards who came with him. "Do not let Madam leave these villa grounds under any circumstances! I apologize, Madam, but this is for your own safety"
###chapter 97: High-Stakes Gamble 
**Philip**  

Under the star-studded night sky, the base of the racetrack buzzed with shouts and jeers. Tensions crackled at the starting line as engines roared, their exhaust fumes blending with the mountain breeze. 
Orlie Petrov, his face etched with worry lines, met me at the starting grid, grasping my shoulder with an urgency that matched his grim expression. 
"Philip, you shouldn't have agreed to this! This underground race is too dangerous. If something goes wrong, it could utterly destroy your hard-earned reputation as a professional racer," he pleaded, eyes boring into mine. 
Shrugging off his grip, shaking my head and returned his intense stare. "Orlie, you're the reason I'm in this mess! You introduced me to Mariano!" I growled through gritted teeth. 
He looked taken aback but persisted. "There's still time to back out." 
"Walk away and risk and face a third punishment? I ignored the first test, and this is the second, Orlie! The third might be my death!" We both knew Mariano's patience was at its limit. 
Steeling my nerves, I avoided his concerned gaze and headed to my race car. This particular "punishment" from Mariano pushed the boundaries of what even he might consider too extreme to kill me simply. 
The rules here were different from a legal race: no safety gear like helmets, no pit crews to perform tire changes or repairs-just me, my skills as a driver, and a highly-tuned machine to keep me alive against an arena of ruthless opponents on an active public highway course. 
My eyes narrowed as the start announcement was made. One by one, the cars roared to life and sped off. I had studied this highway route extensively before coming to this country. The problem was that the road was still open to the public, and oncoming traffic was a constant risk, even at this late hour. 
I was warned about it. 
Weaving through the winding road, I passed several competitors when I sensed another vehicle closing in fast from behind.  
"Damn it!" I muttered, recognizing the signs of sabotage. 
I floored the accelerator, trying to pull away, but the driver behind me matched every move, closing the gap until his bumper hit mine with a jarring impact, forcing me off the road. As we reached a straightaway, I floored it again, pulling ahead and overtaking two more rivals in a rush of speed and noise. 
Just as I began to feel a brief sense of relief, an oncoming civilian car appeared, speeding around a blind turn to avoid another reckless racer. In that split second, our paths crossed, setting us on an unavoidable collision course. 
"Shit!" I exclaimed, a final curse escaping my lips as blinding headlights flooded my vision. 
It was too late. My car spun out of control, and my vision blurred. My body slammed against various surfaces until darkness consumed me 
*** 
**Sarah**  

I couldn't sit still, pacing back and forth across my spacious living room. How could I stay calm after realizing Philip had joined a dangerous race because of me? 
Jane was slumped on the soft sofa, eyes glued to a news report about Philip's disappearance. She covered her mouth in silent shock as she read the details. 
"Augh!" I shrieked in annoyance. 
Jane jumped at my outburst, nearly startled out of her seat. "Sarah, damn it! Calm down!" 
"I can't calm down! I want no, I need to find your brother, Jane," I insisted. 
Jane sighed heavily. "Sarah, let's trust Alex. He said it's dangerous for you to leave Highland Hills right now... My dad's assistant also mentioned they have a team heading to Romania to find Philip. Just wait for their updates, alright?" 
Josh stood nearby, silently observing me. He nodded in agreement with Jane's suggestion. Knowing him, he could probably sense my reckless thoughts and suspected I wanted to leave Highland Hills to find Philip. 
I approached Josh, meeting his steady gaze. "Please, I need to find him!" 
Josh shook his head firmly. "You must understand chasing after Boss Philip right now is too dangerous! You haven't even recovered from your recent panic attack episode. Your state of mind won't help the situation. There's a team searching for Boss Philip already! You must trust their efforts and work on calming yourself, Sarah." 
Stomping my feet in frustration, I knew he was right.  
Everyone around me was echoing the same advice! I needed to wait. Surely, Assistant Alex and Mariano's team were diligently searching for Philip, which is why they didn't want me to leave this place. 
Unable to focus on work, I decided to occupy my restless mind by asking Amanda for food instead.  
I try my best to control my anxious thoughts, picturing Philip safe and sound in another country while forcing myself to keep eating the meal in front of me despite the overwhelming anxiety threatening to tear me apart from the inside out.  
Three days have passed, during which the Cornell has carefully managed the news of Philip's disappearance to avoid another scandal. The guards monitor my every move while my trusted assistant, Emily, attends meetings and events as my official representative. Amir also refuses to let me leave the villa.  
After days of acting casually and showing little concern about my husband's troubling absence, their strict security measures have begun to relax, if only slightly. 
One breezy afternoon, Emily returned to the villa's garden, where I accepted her. My assistant brought a new set of reports and a substantial stack of legal documents requiring my signature.  
Emily discreetly placed them on the table and whispered, "Sarah, one of these is from Madam Olsen. We crossed paths at a business conference this morning. She insisted we keep this communication confidential." 
"What?" I murmured, feigning nonchalance as my gaze flicked briefly toward the imposing guard hovering nearby. I deliberately took a bite of the sandwich I had prepared for Emily. 
As I reviewed the documents, I spotted the letter Emily had mentioned. It bore Madam Olsen's name, formatted like the legal papers. I read it casually, betraying no emotion. 
*'Dear Ms. Mitchell, I won't waste words. My message is clear: I have Philip Cornell.'* 
Beneath her terse declaration, a small QR code was included. 
"Could I use your phone?" I asked Emily. 
Though her brow furrows in confusion, she unlocks her mobile device and places it in my outstretched palm. Scanning the QR code revealed a picture. There, in a stark and unsettling photograph, Philip lies unconscious in a bed, tangled in cables that lead to an old-fashioned medical device, with gauze wrapped around his head. 
My heart sank at his frail appearance. Yet, I felt relief knowing he was safe despite his condition. 
I trembled involuntarily, my eyes stinging with the effort of holding back the tears that desperately wanted to spill forth, but I couldn't let them fall-not with the guard watching me intently. 
Madam Olsen's words pierced my soul: "Now, I have a task for you. I want Mariano's true identity from you. In exchange, I'll return your husband. You have until midnight to decide. We'll meet at the airport later, where I'll reveal your next steps." 
A shiver of nervousness rippled through me. Madam Olsen laid out the answer I desperately craved on a silver platter. But if I agreed to her audacious terms, I would betray the trust of all those people around me!  
What should I do? Every fiber of my being ached to see Philip again, to know with my own eyes that he was okay! 
Emily withdrew the document from my hands and then flashed me a casual smile.  
"Thanks, Sarah! Hopefully, you can return to your business meetings soon..." She raised her voice enough to ensure the guard could overhear. 
"I have to leave, Emily! I can't stay calm..." I struggled to say, battling to stay composed. "I knew he had hurt me deeply before, but what could I do? I can't stop my heart from loving the person she loves. They might think I'm crazy or stupid. But I love Philip!" 
She squeezed my hand reassuringly and whispered, "I understand. Loving too much hurts, but be cautious that your feelings aren't deceiving you. What if Madam Olsen is using this as a tactic to endanger both you and President Cornell?" 
After hours of deliberation, I remained resolute in my decision: I would meet Madam Olsen at the airport. 
But as midnight approached, I faced a huge decision that made me stop and hesitate. It stopped me from making a big, irreversible change that would have meant putting aside my mixed feelings for Philip!
###chapter 98: Guarded Gambit 
**Sarah** 

Outwardly, I appeared calm while waiting for midnight, but my mind was utterly restless. It was already ten o'clock in the evening; I only had to endure the wait for two more hours. 
Since eight that evening, I had been on a group video call with Jakob and the rest of our LoveLogic team, my friend Jane included. I was sequestered alone in my bedroom while Jane participated from the living room. We managed to recruit five additional developers, one of whom had taken over my former coding responsibilities for the application. 
"The early download numbers are very promising," Jakob informed us, reading through some of the glowing app reviews we'd received so far. A few thousand users and counting have installed LoveLogic, and the feedback has been tremendously positive." 
Though my eyes were fixed on the screen, my mind couldn't focus on the meeting. It kept drifting elsewhere. 
"Sarah?" Jakob's voice called out. "Sarah! Jane, did you lose her video feed?" 
Confusion was evident on Jane's face. "No, the connection seems fine on my end." 
I cleared my throat awkwardly. "Sorry, guys, I'm just tired..." 
Massaging my temples, I forced a reassuring smile at the camera. But the truth was, I urgently needed this call to end so I could prepare for my risky meeting with Madam Olsen in two hours. 
"Everyone may now rest except Sarah. We have something to discuss. Jane, you can also stay if you're not busy," said Jakob. 
Some of our team logged out. Jane chose to stay on the call. 
"What's going on, Sarah?" Jakob asked with obvious concern. I couldn't lie to him. 
"I think it's about Brother Philip..." Jane answered for me. 
"Sarah, tell us. President Cornell has been missing for days, but it's only now that you seem lost. What really happened?" 
"N-nothing. It's just that... I feel like I've returned to a time when I was powerless... a time when I couldn't fight back," I explained. 
"Is that all? I want you to understand that you're not being returned to that time. Those people had no respect for you! Sarah, these people care for you, which is why they're protecting you and keeping you out of trouble." 
My eyes started to tear up. Perhaps it's my fault for appearing unfazed in the previous days, leading them to question my current behavior. It could be because I could no longer hide the turmoil inside me. 
I knew Jakob would eventually discover why I was acting this way, so it was better to tell them the truth. 
"Madam Olsen found Philip... I don't know where she took him, but Jane's brother is now in her possession," I quietly responded. 
Jane gasped, and Jakob looked straight at me through the video feed. 
I continued, "Madam Olsen gave me a job. She wants to know who Mariano is. I think she might have had dealings with him, or there might be another reason" 
Jakob was the next to comment. "Mariano has many enemies in the industry. Madam Olsen could use his identity against him. Now that something has happened to President Cornell, Mariano has surely lost an ally. He will definitely look for someone to replace President Cornell, especially for certain business transactions. Madam Olsen knows you're Mariano's target, so she made a deal with you." 
Jane remained silent, just listening intently, though her confusion was evident-she didn't fully understand the web of secrets and threats we were discussing. I pursed my lips. Mariano also lost an assistant because of me, so it's highly possible that I am now his target. 
"Sarah, what exactly are you planning?" Jakob asked with a knitted brow. 
"I just want to get Philip's body back safely. That's all I care about right now: to ensure Philip is safe. Madam Olsen is holding him captive, and she could do anything to him." 
"But you understand that it's impossible to discover Mariano's identity, right? He uses multiple personas. We aren't even certain he ever directly revealed himself to President Cornell." 
"I know..." 
For the first time, Jane voiced her concern. "What about Brother Philip? Are we just going to leave him with Madam Olsen?" 
"I'll find a way. Don't worry, Jane..." 
"Sarah, please," Jakob urged. "Whatever your plan is, you need to tell me the details." 
I gave him a small smile before we ended the call. 
*** 
Jane and I arrived at Serenity Pines Estate around eleven at night, accompanied by Josh and several guards who had been reassigned to Amir's villa following Philip's disappearance. 
A frantic guard hurried towards me as we passed through the wrought-iron gates. 
"What's going on?" I asked him 
"Madam Sarah, I apologize for disturbing your evening... I received an anonymous call from one of the neighbors who said they saw a shadowy figure climbing over the high exterior wall. There appears to be a trespasser at Serenity Pines," he explained. 
Most of Philip's security team, stationed to protect Megan, were reassigned to Amir's villa to bolster security around me during Philip's absence. 
"Have you checked the surveillance footage?" I inquired. 
Jane and I exchanged looks. 
"Oh my God! I think it could be Madam Cornell sneaking around!" Jane gasped, her eyes going wide.  
"Why would you say that?" I asked, feigning surprise. 
"Well, my stepmother is the only one cunning enough to sneak in, right?" my friend reasoned.  
The guards contemplated this. "But Madam Cornell is too elderly to climb such a tall wall." 
"My stepmother has nowhere else to go now. With Philip gone, she might be hiding here," Jane argued. 
I issued a decisive command. "All of you, search the villa! Whether it's Madam Cornell or not, we must ensure no intruder has entered!" 
The guards quickly sprang into action, spreading out across the expansive grounds to thoroughly search every room, closet, and hidden corner of the grand villa. With their focus now elsewhere, I saw my opportunity. 
I casually strolled out through the gate, the cool night air wrapping around me as I approached the waiting car. Just as I settled into the driver's seat and started the engine, I was caught off guard by Josh slipping into the passenger seat beside me, his expression a mix of suspicion and concern. 
"Tsk! I can't believe you! Was it you or Jane who pretended to be the neighbor reporting someone climbing the wall?" he accused, his gaze fixed on me in the dim light. 
I chose not to respond. Let him think whatever he wants! 
What he said is true: Madam Cornell is currently being sought by the authorities. My guards remained calm due to my recent actions, so they didn't suspect my intention to escape when I ordered them to scour every corner of Serenity Pines. 
When they were distracted, I seized the opportunity. I rushed the car toward the airport; my curiosity about seeing Philip was overwhelming. 
"Sarah! You're an idiot!" Josh exclaimed. 
"Yes, I am. I'm glad you're here in the car! Madam Olsen wants to know who Mariano is. Well, you are going to pretend to be this Mariano!" I declared. 
Josh's face darkened. "Explain to me what happened today that led us to this point." 
I recounted everything to Josh as we drove, including how I received a letter from Madam Olsen informing me that she now has Philip in her possession. 
"You're right! I can pretend to be Mariano! But that doesn't mean she'll believe me! Do you think Madam Olsen holds Mariano in such low regard? Sarah, I've met Mariano before! If Madam Olsen wants information about him, I can provide it!" Josh lectured passionately. 
"I'm terrified about what might happen," I admitted to him in a small voice.  
"You should be scared!" Josh chided. 
"Should I simply allow fear to overwhelm me? What about Philip?" 
When we arrived at the airport, there were only ten minutes left before my planned meeting with Madam Olsen was scheduled. As I hastily entered the airport, a chillingly familiar voice called out behind us. 
"Where do you think you're going?" 
When I turned around, I was met with Amir's piercing gaze. At this point, I knew escape was no longer an option.
###chapter 99: Unexpected Bump 
**Sarah** 

Dread washed over me like a storm cloud, dragging a wave of anxiety that clawed at my throat. My breaths grew shallow as Amir's group came closer, my eyes glued to them, unable to look away. 
"I've been observing your movements closely, Sarah. Perhaps you've conveniently forgotten, but I own the villa you reside in. I know precisely what you've been up to," Amir stated firmly. 
I approached him, pleading, "Amir, please" 
I want to see Philip! But I didn't voice that aloud. 
He shook his head incredulously. "Sarah, seriously! What on earth do you think you're doing? Do you understand the danger you're carelessly putting yourself in?" 
Hot tears pricked at the corners of my eyes, slowly welling up as my chest constricted painfully with the weight of unspoken desires. 
Amir grasped my arm gently and spoke in a reassuring tone. "They are doing everything they can to find Philip. You're in danger; Mariano has targeted you, but I've done everything in my power to prevent that. So, I won't allow you to leave." 
I struggled to draw air into my lungs, anxiety's iron grip threatening to overwhelm me utterly. 
"I need to go to the restroom, please" I managed to choke out between ragged gasps. 
Amir's expression tightened, clearly unconvinced by my request. He probably suspected I was merely trying to fabricate an opportunity to slip away and escape, evading the watchful guards. 
"Amir, I'm serious. I need to throw up!" I insisted desperately. 
He must have noticed the color draining from my face. Without further protest, he escorted me to the nearest restroom. A woman emerged from it, pulling a small suitcase. 
"You there! Could you please accompany her inside? My sister is feeling faint and needs someone with her. You'll be compensated for your time," Amir requested urgently of the startled woman. 
The woman hesitated, clearly unsure about Amir's motives and my situation within his group. 
Ignoring their exchange, I rushed into the nearest cubicle, emptying the contents of my upset stomach. 
The concerned woman rubbed my back soothingly. "Are you okay, miss? Can you tell me if that man detained you? Is that why he asked me to watch over you? And why did he call you 'sister'?" Her voice was filled with protective concern, spoken in a quiet tone. 
I shook my head weakly. "No, he really is my brother." 
"Oh... I'm sorry. I thought he got you pregnant and then abducted you. That's why you're in this dreadful situation."  
I froze at her words, feeling the blood drain from my face. Shit...I trembled and covered my mouth with a shaking hand. Grabbing my phone with trembling fingers, I checked the calendar, desperately trying to recall my last period. It had been two months already... 
Damn it! There was a significant chance I was pregnant right now, and here I was again, recklessly planning to put my potential future child in harm's way. 
"C-can you please buy me three pregnancy test kits?" I requested, my voice quivering as I struggled to maintain composure. I needed to be sure! 
"Oh! Sure!" The concerned woman readily agreed before heading out. 
"Where's Sarah?" Amir's voice sounded concerned. "Did you help her leave?"  
I hurried towards the door, hoping to calm him. "I'm here! Amir, I'm not leaving if that's what you're thinking. I-I just asked her to buy me some sanitary pads. I'm having PMS. I'm staying, that's a promise."  
Despite my assurance, Amir still seemed suspicious. I ignored him and sank onto the chair nearest the ladies' room entrance. 
"What's going on with you?" Josh approached me, noticing my distress. 
"Probably panic attacks," I responded casually, not wanting to draw attention. 
He felt my pulse but then seemed to realize something. "You're-" 
I shook my head, looking directly into his eyes, silencing him. We were in a public place, and I didn't want to announce my possible pregnancy to anyone who might overhear. 
The woman soon returned, discreetly handing me a plain brown bag containing the pregnancy tests. 
"You, accompany her again," Amir immediately ordered in a tone that brooked no argument. 
"Geez! Stop acting like you're my boss!" the woman retorted irritably. "I'll go with her, don't worry!" 
I immediately retreated into a cubicle and used all three of the pregnancy test kits, my heart pounding wildly in my chest. And there, the harsh truth was revealed-I was undoubtedly pregnant! All three tests showed positive results. Tears welled up as I came out, facing the overwhelming reality. 
"Are you okay? You don't want to be pregnant; is that why you're crying?" she asked gently. 
"Can you... Can you please hide these kits?" I choked out, thrusting some cash into her hand imploringly. "Please..." 
I couldn't stop my mouth from trembling uncontrollably as confusion and turmoil swirled within me. I loved Philip and was ready to do anything for him despite the hurt and pain he had caused me before. I yearned to see him again, to gaze into his eyes and feel his embrace... but I wouldn't dare trade my unborn child's safety and well-being just for that selfish desire. That realization is what made my heart ache profoundly. 
Here came the one big obstacle that would definitely stop me from acting impulsively. 
When the woman refused payment, I insisted.  
"I must go, Miss. I might miss my flight to Dubai," she said, bidding me farewell. 
"I'm so sorry for the inconvenience I've caused you. Coincidentally, I happen to have a residence in Dubai, too. Hopefully, our paths will cross again there," I replied 
She said she was going to Dubai for a new job opportunity in another country. That revelation influenced my difficult final decision. 
My heart felt like it had broken into countless sharp pieces, but I knew I had to find the strength to do what was right. I couldn't risk putting this new life inside me in danger, especially after the terrible ordeal of my last pregnancy, where I had been careless around dangerous people who wanted to harm us. 
I stared at Amir with a blank expression, steeling my resolve. "I'll follow your wish," I said quietly, my voice lacking emotion. 
The woman, a stranger until that moment, shot Amir a glance and departed, dragging her luggage away. I never even learned her name. 
Amir gently guided me through the busy airport, his hand resting on my back. Then, a voice that sent shivers down my spine pierced through the noise. 
"Well, well... Look who's here. My family!" Madam Olsen's voice interrupted. 
Amir's eyes gleamed. "You won't involve Sarah in any of your wicked plans. That's certain," he said firmly, his tone laced with threat. 
Madam Olsen's lips twisted into a cruel smirk. "Is that your decision, Sarah? Remember, I hold Philip's fate in my hands," she challenged. 
I kept my emotions hidden, ensuring she couldn't decipher my thoughts. "Perhaps you've misunderstood why I'm at the airport, Madam Olsen..." 
"Oh, really?" She arched one perfectly sculpted brow in mock surprise. 
"I have no intention of helping you discover who this Mariano person is, no matter how obsessed you seem with him. I refuse to get involved in whatever problem you have with him," I clarified. 
"This bitch!" Madam Olsen raised her voice, gritting her teeth as if she hadn't expected such defiance from me. 
"Don't you dare call my sister names!" Amir snapped angrily. 
"Are you certain about your plan, Sarah? You won't cooperate with me at all? With one simple command to my people, they'll surely remove all support and protection for your precious husband," she threatened. 
I remained utterly emotionless on the surface. I've mastered this facade! I should be accustomed to feigning indifference by now, even though her words made my heart clench painfully. 
"Madam Olsen, Philip never loved me. You might understand, having been close with Madam Cornell. I did everything for Philip back then. Why should I reconcile with you in exchange for the safety of the people who ruined my life? All I can tell you is I'm doing just fine without him." I shrugged my shoulders nonchalantly. 
Madam Cornell narrowed her eyes. She clearly didn't anticipate that response, but I sensed I had convinced her with my act. 
Just then, Josh approached. He confronted Madam Olsen. "I'll disclose Mariano's identity, but you must hand over President Cornell." 
"Oh, how exciting! Is this the reason why you've come here today?" she asked Josh. 
"But first, I'd like to know-what's your motive? Why do you want Mariano's identity?" Josh inquired. 
"Of course, to get rid of him!" She laughed wildly. "I've been doing shady deals with that sneaky guy for years. Once he's gone, I'll take over his business and all his dirty money! Isn't that brilliant?!" Madam Olsen said, sounding unhinged. 
"You're utterly obsessed..." I muttered. 
"Megan Thompson is Mariano," Josh stated bluntly. 
Madam Olsen's eyes lit up. 
"You have the means to verify. Megan has utilized countless false identities over the years!" 
I pressed my lips together, fighting the urge to shake my head in disbelief. Josh seemed intent on escalating his animosity toward that woman.
###chapter 100: Silent Cries 
**Sarah** 

"That doesn't make any sense!" Madam Olsen scoffed, shaking her head at Josh's statement. 
Josh remained resolute. "All I know for certain is that Mariano is a woman masquerading as a man, and Megan is that person." 
Madam Olsen's expression grew serious as she turned her penetrating gaze towards me. "Unbelievable! Are you sure about this, Sarah?" 
I met her stare without flinching, my face emotionless. "I apologize, Madam Olsen, but perhaps you've forgotten that I severed all romantic ties with Philip Cornell long ago." I clenched my jaw defiantly. 
"You!" She pointed an accusing finger at Josh. "You will come with us immediately. I intend to apprehend President Cornell because he's become an intolerable nuisance!" 
"You will not lay a hand on my bodyguard!" I warned Madam Olsen. 
"It's funny that you have more concern for your bodyguard than your husband." She sneered. 
"Ex-husband!" I corrected sharply. 
Amir guided me away from Madam Olsen's group. As I turned and walked away, I felt a strange unease. Won't Josh be in danger? I couldn't calm down at the thought that Philip might not be safe. 
I sent a message to Assistant Alex. 
'I'm going to Dubai. Madam Olsen has Philip and Josh. I'll give you Josh's location. Philip is probably still in Europe.' 
Earlier, before we reached the airport, I had instructed Josh to download the LoveLogic app and gave him access to my private server so we could communicate secretly if trouble arose. 
No one will suspect anything since they'll believe it's just a game. If Madam Olsen's men take Josh's cell phone, I will still get his location data as long as the LoveLogic app runs. I could only hope Josh's phone battery would last. 
When I boarded Amir's private jet, I broke down in tears. However, I forced myself to calm down. More than ever, I needed to be brave. 
"Sarah, what's going on?" Amir asked, brow furrowed with concern at my uncharacteristic display of emotion. "Earlier, you were determined to leave; you wanted to see Philip. Now you're crying" 
"Because it's hard, brother. Madam Olsen tested what I could do. I-I felt utterly helpless and useless," I replied, my voice trembling as I gasped for air between sobs. 
"This is the right thing to do, Sarah Don't let yourself be blinded because of that man." 
Wiping tears from my eyes, I managed, "Please send someone to get Amanda. I won't leave for Dubai without her." 
"I already sent someone to get her and Pepper earlier. They're surely on their way to the airport now," Amir explained. 
"Thank you" I whispered. Amir let me rest my head on his shoulder as I silently wept. 
'I'm so sorry, Philip. I can't bear to hurt my child a second time.' 
If hiding in Dubai for a year was what it took to protect this baby, then I was willing to make that sacrifice. I would pay any price to keep them safe. 
I was emotionally exhausted and drifted into a restless sleep, reassured by Amir's comforting presence. I was barely aware when Amanda and Pepper arrived. Amir gently laid me down on his comfortable bed so that I could rest and recover from the emotional turmoil. 
*** 
When I woke up, I realized Amir's private jet had landed in another country. My phone buzzed with messages from Assistant Alex, Jakob, and Jane that had come through once we caught a signal. 
Jakob's message read: I'm currently in contact with Assistant Alex! I tracked Josh's location using his phone's GPS. Luckily, his battery isn't dead yet. 
That timestamp on Jakob's message was 12 hours ago. How long had I been asleep during the flight? 
Next, I opened Assistant Alex's message: I'll get the boss, Madam Sarah. 
Jane had sent multiple frantic messages: Amanda and Pepper were picked up by Mr. Benner's security team. Are you with Mr. Benner now, Sarah? What's happening? Are you not contacting Madam Olsen about locating Brother Philip anymore? Where is Josh? 
Her subsequent message read: They locked Mr. Benner's villa. I moved to Serenity Pines while waiting for news. Please tell me everything is fine. 
Realizing I needed to update Jane, I felt compelled to call her.  
"Hello, Sarah!" Jane's uneasy voice came through after the first ring. 
"Jane..." 
"Oh, thank god, are you okay?" 
"Jane, I can't return to Highland Hills right now. Amir took me back to Dubai," I explained. "Please stay safe at Serenity Pines until your brother returns. Josh went with Madam Olsen instead of me to retrieve Philip's body. I-I'm so sorry I can't do more right now..." 
Just because Amir had flown me to Dubai didn't mean I was giving up. I will continue coordinating efforts remotely with Assistant Alex and Jakob. 
"The important thing is that you're okay...please just keep me updated whenever you can," Jane's voice was laced with concern.  
She was probably assuming the worst-that Amir had caught me trying to flee and kept me under close watch in Dubai while Josh took my place coordinating Madam Olsen. 
"Let me know if Philip returns to Highland Hills," I added. 
"I will!" 
Amir stood by his jet's private room, ready to depart. Wiping away my tears, I nodded.  
"Let's go," he announced. 
Amanda silently tagged along as we made our way to Grandpa Mitchell's mansion. My mind was foggy as I blankly gazed at the road ahead. Exhaustion weighed heavily on me, likely due to my pregnancy, which I could feel distinctly. 
Grandpa Mitchell was visibly surprised to see me, especially when I announced my intention to stay at the mansion for a few days. The older man followed closely behind as Amir escorted me inside my bedroom. I sank down onto the edge of the bed, bracing myself for the judgment I was sure was coming. 
"What's going on, Sarah? I know you. Your decisions don't change easily. At the airport, I saw in your eyes that you were willing to do anything, risk everything, to retrieve Philip Cornell's body," Amir lectured, arms crossed, scrutinizing my emotions. 
"I'm pregnant!" I announced. 
Amanda dropped the things she was arranging, gasping audibly. 
Amir's eyes widened in surprise while Grandpa Mitchell squinted thoughtfully at the news. 
"I blamed panic attacks for feeling unwell at the airport, but the truth is, I'm pregnant, Amir!" Tears began flowing freely down my cheeks once more. "It was so painful in that moment, having to choose between continuing my obsession with finding Philip or prioritizing the welfare of my child. But I need to protect my baby-that's why I changed my mind." 
Grandpa Mitchell tiredly rubbed his wrinkled hands across his face. 
"I don't know whether to be thankful you got pregnant and avoided that dangerous scheme or angry about the news," Amir remarked, frustration evident in his tone. 
"I'm pregnant! This is not a sickness, Amir! And I will do whatever it takes to protect this child! No one can know about this pregnancy yet, so I have to find a doctor I can completely trust to take care of me," I warned, recalling the incident with Dr. Morgan. 
"What about your job?" Grandpa Mitchell asked with concern. 
"I'll continue working as usual. Still attending online meetings and everything..." I assured him. 
Grandpa Mitchell settled onto the bed beside me, enveloping me in a warm, comforting hug as I cried, overwhelmed by the sense of my family's love surrounding me.  
"Don't worry, my dear. Everything is going to be just fine..." my grandpa murmured soothingly. 
"Thank you..." I whispered in return. 
Twenty-four hours after returning to Dubai, I received word that Philip's body had been successfully retrieved. I was overwhelmed with gratitude. 
I hope he's alright, but not until one week more has passed...
###chapter 101: Heartbeats of Fear 
**Sarah** 

I've been feeling unwell for the past few days with dizziness, nausea, and occasional vomiting episodes. These symptoms have intensified recently, likely due to the early stages of my pregnancy. I want to see Philip, and in order to calm me, I keep thinking he's doing well. 
Will I remain hidden away in my grandfather's mansion for an entire year?  
I want my child to be safe, but should I let fear control me because of what happened before? Absolutely not! 
Jane has been providing regular updates, informing me that Philip remains unconscious, but his condition is no longer critical. I suppose I should let Philip regain consciousness naturally. I've heard his condition was terrible when he was rescued from Madam Olsen. I'm trying not to dwell on it for my mental well-being. 
In the meantime, I'm organizing my schedule. I have some important gatherings to attend before my pregnancy becomes noticeable. I've talked to Emily, and we have an important event in New York hosted by a company my grandpa invested in. 
Grandpa Mitchell noticed I was dazed while I was in the garden eating fruit. 
He joined me at the ornate metal table, solemnly saying, "Sarah..."  
"Grandpa..." 
"I'm not going to scold you about the path your life is taking, but what are your plans?" he asked. 
I knew this inquiry went beyond my current pregnancy. "Are you talking about my situation with Philip?" I asked tentatively. "I know you weren't happy when you found out he got me pregnant." 
He sighed. "I'm worried about your situation. I don't want what happened last year to happen again. You might completely lose your mind." 
I attempted to explain my mindset as clearly as I could.  
"I want to be happy, Grandpa Mitchell. I was happy with Philip over the past few months. Yes, I made a mistake and got pregnant because I temporarily forgot the cruelty he put me through last year. Like you, I fear those horrors could happen again. I can't go through that kind of anguish again." 
"You deserve happiness. That's my only wish for you..." my grandfather said softly, taking my hand in his and gently squeezing it. 
"Aren't you angry with me for falling in love with someone else?" I asked him. 
He sighed deeply. "I won't lie; I am angry about the circumstances. But the truth is, I have no control over matters of the heart. Just promise me you'll keep yourself safe, whatever you decide. As long as I know my favorite grandchild is okay..." He managed a warm smile. 
Grandpa Mitchell and I embraced, and I felt his unwavering love. Despite my new pregnancy, he did not ridicule or judge me. 
Later that same day, Grandpa Mitchell and I had a lengthy meeting to discuss business matters while I adjusted my schedule with Emily's assistance. 
Around eleven o'clock that night, my phone rang. Worried it might be about Philip, I furrowed my brow and answered promptly-it was Assistant Alex calling. 
"Miss Sarah!" Concern laced his voice. 
"What happened? How's my husband, Alex?" Fear gripped me, and I fired off several questions in rapid succession. 
"He's still in a coma. Boss Philip suffered a severe fall with multiple broken bones. We don't know when he'll recover, but Dr. Ethan has frequently checked on him." 
I sighed heavily. 
"But that's not the reason I called... Madam Cornell has abducted Jane!" 
"What?!" I gasped, quickly turning on the bedside lamp. "What do you mean? What happened?" 
Alex explained, "Earlier, Jane went out with a classmate from London who invited her. She didn't return to Serenity Pines as planned. Initially, we weren't overly worried because her security measures weren't as strict as yours. She had also mentioned she'd be home late. Shortly after that, Madam Cornell called to tell us that she had kidnapped Jane." 
My lips trembled. 
"The Chairman's wife is demanding a ransom. It seems she needs money since the chairman has completely cut her off-bank accounts, cards, everything. She's asking for two hundred million in exchange for Jane." 
"Oh my God!" I covered my mouth in shock. 
"But there's another thing, Madam Sarah..." Alex's voice turned more serious. "She's insisting that you personally deliver the two hundred million ransom..." 
I shuddered violently as the chilling words hit me. My eyes narrowed in intense anger. 
"Damn it!" I hissed. 
I had been doing everything I could to shield myself from that cruel woman, but it seemed fate had other plans. My teeth clenched in anger. Once again, I must confront the person responsible for my first child's death. A storm of anxiety, anger, fear, and dread churned sickeningly in my stomach. 
'Shit! What should I do?' 
"Chairman Cornell has agreed to pay the two hundred million dollar ransom demand to secure Jane's release," Alex explained, his voice tense. "But we both know it's not just about the money, Madam Sarah."  
I felt my fists clench involuntarily. "I'll meet you at Serenity Pines. We have to formulate a plan to outwit her quickly, Alex. With Philip in a coma, no one can control his unhinged mother's actions. But I won't allow that woman to make a fool of me again!" 
Alex hesitated before speaking. "Madam Sarah... are you completely sure you want to confront her? It could be very risky." 
"Yes! She thinks she's clever, but I see through her. I'm certain her targets extend beyond me-she harbors equal animosity towards Jane and me." I rose with resolve. "I'll call you again once I've made travel arrangements." 
The moment I ended the call with Alex, I quickly messaged Jakob with an urgent request: 'Emergency! Please log in immediately!' 
I pressed the buzzer for Amanda's attention and settled on the couch with my laptop. 
As she entered with sleepy eyes, I was already rapidly typing commands into my laptop. 
"Miss?" 
"Pack my things. I'm heading to Highland Hills," I instructed firmly. 
"Is everything alright?" Concern furrowed Amanda's brow. Such a sudden request in the dead of night was unusual. 
"Yes..." 
"What about the baby?" Amanda asked worriedly. 
I smiled reassuringly. "Everything will be fine, Amanda. I'll return in a few days." 
I quickly booked the earliest available flight to Highland Hills. Just as I completed the reservation, a notification appeared-Finally, Jakob logged into our chat channel. 
Jakob: What's going on? Your message sounded serious. 
Me: Jane's been kidnapped by her stepmother. 
Jakob: What?! (He included it with an emoji with widened eyes.) 
Me: I asked you to log in because my wicked ex-mother-in-law is demanding a $200 million ransom. 
Jakob: Shiiit! That woman is completely deranged! 
Me: Now, let's do the job, Jakob. I want to catch that old woman before she does anything to us or Jane. 
Jakob and I began meticulously planning our next moves. We would utilize the LoveLogic app to aid our efforts.
###chapter 102: Ultimate Underdog 
**Sarah** 

*Serenity Pines Estate* 
"You may now come in, Sarah." Ethan's voice was somber as he spoke. He stood next to another doctor, both looking serious after examining Philip. 
I entered the bedroom I had shared with Philip for three years. So much had happened here. This is where I experienced waiting for him as his wife, where I made him feel my overwhelming love. This room held everything, including the night we conceived our first child. Perhaps it was where we created the new life growing inside me. 
My lips formed a straight line when I saw him lying down. 
Ethan closed the door behind me, giving us privacy for whatever words might be spoken or left unsaid. I stood at the foot of the bed, taking in the sight of my husband surrounded by a tangle of machines and wires. 
'See you soon, my love' Those were the words Philip said the last time we saw each other in Las Vegas. The memory brought tears to my eyes. 
Legs shaking, I sat down beside him, staring intently at his pale lips, the crisp white bandage wrapped around his head, and the steady blink of the monitors measuring his fragile vitals. With exquisite care, I cradled his pale hand.  
"I've said countless times that I don't need you anymore" I confessed in a broken whisper. "I tried to avoid you many times, but I always ended up coming back to you" I wiped my tears even though they continued to flow. 
"I love calling you 'this brute.' I enjoyed our banters. I miss the Philip stealing kisses to drive me wild" I choked between sobs. "The way you give me attention now is so different from when we were married, and it scared me" 
Taking a deep breath, I continued, "Philip, I'm pregnant I want to question myself, hide this pregnancy, and give you a chance like you told me. If you love me, please. I need you I'll wait for you, Philip" 
I kissed his cheek, but my chest tightened. Philip seemed lifeless at that moment. I missed the way he used to look at me. 
I swiftly reminded myself of the need to gather strength, find calmness for clearer thinking, and fortify myself against the tumultuous emotions stirring within. 
"I won't allow your mother to hurt me, so if I ever hurt Madam Cornell, I want your forgiveness, Philip. Will you understand me?"  
I left the room without a trace of tears. Josh stood straight from where he was leaning against the wall when he saw me, his eyes alert and assessing. 
"What's your plan?" he asked. 
I regarded him thoughtfully. "I'm going to get Jane." 
He cautioned me gently, "Sarah, whatever you're planning, please don't involve-" 
Glancing around the thankfully empty hallway cautiously, I interrupted him with a warning, knowing he referred to my pregnancy. "Don't say anything more about it! I'm keeping this utterly a secret for now. Madam Cornell shouldn't find out, and I'm unsure who my true allies are." 
"I'm just saying you need to be extremely careful this time. Remember, that's why you've been having panic attacks! That woman has outmaneuvered and blindsided you before; she could easily do so again if you let your guard down," Josh spoke through clenched teeth, clearly concerned. 
I knew his worry stemmed from genuine care. He seemed like both a bodyguard and a therapist to me. 
"Don't worry. Everything's planned, and you'll be there to watch over me through all this," I reassured him. His surprise was evident. With Josh, I felt safe; I trusted him not to betray me. "By the way, where's your ex-girlfriend?" 
Josh's expression darkened. "Megan's in some seriously hot water recently with the authorities. She's been taking substantial sums from friends and associates, including Rebecca Cornell, under the guise of investments. Instead, she's diverting that money into different companies and ventures, just like she did with me, all to fund her extravagant lifestyle." 
Josh's jaw tightened visibly as he struggled to maintain his professional demeanor. When he spoke again, his voice carried a hint of disdain.  
"Ah, and the stock market crash at Luminary Productions, where she heavily invested expecting results from President Cornell's Sci-Fi project, didn't help. Megan's facing significant losses and can't repay her lenders. Authorities are searching for her," Josh explained in detail. 
"Oh! So, where is she now?" I inquired. 
"Megan was last seen at the airport the same night you and Amir left for Dubai. She traveled to Berlin, and after that, her whereabouts became unknown. I keep thinking that Madam Olsen might have found Megan..." 
I shrugged, uncertain whether Madam Olsen truly believed Megan was the elusive Mariano she seemed so eager to uncover. 
Much like Madam Cornell, I can't shake the feeling that Megan will return.  
"What are your thoughts on her disappearance?" I asked Josh. 
He shrugged casually. "Sarah, as a psychiatrist, understanding troubled minds is part of my job. But I prefer to prioritize my own mental health rather than speculate about that woman's whereabouts." 
"But surely you must be angry with her?" I pressed. 
"Anger is a natural response, isn't it?" he replied flatly, refusing to show his genuine emotions. 
I shook my head, realizing our conversation wasn't going anywhere. I admired how calm he stayed even in chaotic situations. It looked like he found peace at Serenity Pines, overseeing Philip's team diligently. Maybe he was watching out for me, too, in his own way. 
"Madam Sarah, Mr. Martin is waiting outside," Assistant Alex interrupted, engaging Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt in conversation. 
I walked towards the broad, arched entrance and was taken aback to see Bronn standing there, deep in thought, as he puffed on a cigarette. His tall, rugged silhouette stood out distinctly in the speckled afternoon sunlight filtering through the trees. 
"Bronn?" I exclaimed in surprise. 
He glanced up, hastily discarding his cigarette in a nearby bin. 
"Come inside!" I urged him. 
Bronn walked into the estate's grand hallway behind me. Ethan looked at him with confusion, probably wondering why someone who might be a suitor had arrived while Philip was still in a coma. I chose to ignore Ethan's questioning expression. 
"How are you, and how's President Cornell?" Bronn greeted me warmly. 
"I'm managing. Philip's condition hasn't changed, but he's safe," I replied, sidestepping the sadness that accompanied thoughts of Philip. "I didn't expect to see you here at Highland Hills." 
"I just found out you arrived today. I talked to your grandfather, and he asked me to ensure you're safe, hence my sudden visit," Bronn explained. 
I no longer feel saddened by the lost beginning of what could have been between us. A lot has happened, and I truly believe I'm meant for Philip. 
"I really appreciate you coming, Bronn. Anyway, now that you're here, could you visit Emily for me? She's at the office, and I haven't been able to check on her regarding everything going on. I didn't even give her notice that I'd be arriving today..." 
Bronn swallowed hard, guilt flashing across his chiseled features.  
"Don't feel guilty, Bronn. Emily has been handling several of my engagements for days, and I feel terrible about it. Please, go see how she's doing," I pleaded. 
The truth was, I still didn't fully understand the nature of his relationship with Emily. But I sensed Bronn was still trying to convince himself that he and I were meant to be together despite my commitment to Philip. 
"After our last incident in Las Vegas, things were not good between us. Emily told me to stay away from her," he said 
"Come on, bro! Stop being stupid!" I winced, unable to stop myself from asking why the men interested in me always ended up in such complicated situations. 
"Madam!" Assistant Alex's voice rang out. "Madam Cornell has sent new instructions. She wants us to take the money to The Oceanic Odyssey." 
The Oceanic Odyssey? 
"It's a cruise ship that docked at Neon Port last night," Ethan clarified. "As far as I know, it's scheduled to depart at six this afternoon." 
"They're allowing vehicles to be brought aboard, so that's why Madam Cornell chose it," Alex confirmed. 
"Besides, it will make it easy for her to escape if needed," I added, glinting my eyes. This could be the perfect opportunity. 
Right on time, my stylish sports car arrived, driven by Jakob and another team member. I was already starting to form a plan.
###chapter 103: A Mobile Masterplan 
**Sarah** 

Madam Cornell informed me that she would hand over Jane once I transferred her the remaining 100 million dollars. Chairman Cornell prepared the initial 100 million in cash, already stashed in a van. 
Due to the cruise ship's vast size, we have yet to learn where Jane is hidden. However, the exchange is set for half an hour before the ship's scheduled departure, adding to the urgency and complexity of the situation. 
I will give the car key to Madam Cornell, who will have it inspected by her lackey. Following that, we will proceed to the next step: her handing Jane over to me in exchange for the additional 100 million dollars, which I will then transfer via EFT to various accounts. She strictly warned me that she would harm Jane if I didn't comply. She chose the cruise ship because of the many guests who could potentially get hurt. 
Bronn and Emily are pretending to be a honeymooning couple.  
Josh, Assistant Alex, and five additional bodyguards are with me.  
Jakob and another team member, Lexi, drove the van containing the cash. Unfortunately, Jane's phone was off, preventing us from tracking her location via GPS. 
At five-thirty in the afternoon, Madam Cornell called me on video chat to confirm my presence on the ship, which alarmed Jakob and the others. She saw my background and hair blown by the deck's wind. 
"Well, well It's been a while since I last saw your irritating face, Sarah," commented Madam Cornell. 
"Let's skip the small talk, ex-mother-in-law. Let me see Jane!" I demanded. 
With a smug expression, she moved the camera to reveal Jane's face. Jane's eyes were puffy and her cheeks swollen, which is clear evidence of mistreatment. She had cling wrap tightly wound around her mouth, silencing her. 
"Jane, you'll be fine!" I assured my friend. 
"Oh, how cute!" Madam Cornell mocked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.  
My hands clenched into fists at her cruelty. 
"That's right! Let's stop this nonsense! You can send your lackey to the cruise's parking space. Tell him to go to VAN 3274," I instructed. 
Her face twisted with irritation. "We agreed that you give me the key before I send my assistant to check the van!" she snapped, her control slipping momentarily. 
"Oops, my apologies... I didn't quite understand the rules," I said, feigning ignorance with an exaggerated look of confusion on my face. 
Madam Cornell ground her teeth. "This bitch!" 
"I'm here on the deck; it's not like I'll run! Besides, I left the van open; someone might steal the money from there. Better send your annoying lackey." 
Madam Cornell's face flushed red with rage as she abruptly dismissed whoever was with her from the cabin with a curt wave of her hand. 
While I was talking to Madam Cornell, Jakob's voice came through the Bluetooth headset in my ear.  
"There were people who entered and then exited the cabin! I can't tell which one Madam Cornell's assistant is from the cameras. And I don't know which room the person who left went into," Jakob's voice warned. 
It was boarding time on the cruise, so I understood Jakob's confusion. Unfortunately, they had to hack its security system. They tried to find out where Madam Cornell's cabin was, but the reservation wasn't in her name. We believed she used another name, possibly the name of the person with her. For now, we had to be content with the security cameras in the hallways. 
"Are you stunned into silence, Sarah?" Madam Cornell mocked sarcastically, grabbing my attention on the video call. 
"Why? Did you want to chat and catch up?" I replied with an amused smirk. 
She rolled her eyes so exaggeratedly. 
After three tense minutes, Jakob's voice broke through again. "I've got eyes on the man we're looking for who was with Madam Cornell! He opened the van where the cash is." 
Philip's bodyguard was hiding inside the stacked luggage to ensure Madam Cornell's man couldn't escape. Trey was currently in the van. 
Jakob continued, "The assistant is now using his phone, likely calling your monster-in-law,"  
Right after Jakob relayed that, Madam Cornell's phone started ringing. 
"Now we'll find out if you prepared my ransom money as instructed, Sarah..." she said, answering the call. 
"I didn't prepare your cash. Remember, it was your husband who prepared the money for you. Don't you miss him?" I replied, my voice dripping with disdain.  
Currently, Chairman Cornell surely wants to kill Philip's mother for the embarrassment she caused, and now she plans to take a large amount of money in exchange for Jane. 
Jane is still a daughter, and this is where I realized that Jane is important to her father. 
Madam Cornell answered her subordinate's call; her lips pressed tightly together in an angry line. 
"I've got the money! I'm bringing out the van!" I heard her men announce as the crazy woman had the phone on speaker. 
We only had ten minutes before the cruise ship completely closed for boarding. As I expected, Madam Cornell planned to bring the ransom cash-filled van out again to ensure she received the money. 
I managed a strained smile at Madam Cornell. "Now that you've got the 100 million, can you release Jane?" I asked pointedly. 
"I won't release Jane. Did you think I'd expose myself that easily? I'll leave your friend here locked in this cabin! We'll meet on the deck, you'll transfer the money to me, and then I'll give you the cabin number where you can find Jane!" she asserted firmly. 
"Sounds like a plan," I mused, keeping my cool. 
"I'll call you again with instructions!" she declared before abruptly ending the call. 
I pressed the end button, my expression turning grave after the call with Madam Cornell. 
"She's left another lackey to watch Jane. Be careful, Emily..." I announced to my team over the open line. "Now, let's get to the next phase!" 
"Madam Cornell has vacated the suite. Judging by her attire, she likely intends to make an escape! I suspect she plans to jump and swim away," Jakob reported. 
"That deranged woman!" I commented though I had already anticipated such a ploy. That's precisely why she had chosen this cruise ship setting for her scheme. 
Jakob began counting down. "Three, two, one, go!" 
The LoveLogic app alarms sounded-it even rang on my phone. 
The app announced that players could get a limited edition item if they completed a particular task. Fortunately, we had recruited forty enthusiastic gamers solely for this cruise to participate. 
Their initial task was to: gather twenty hearts within an hour. 
To collect these hearts, gamers had to use their cameras to navigate through the corridors, halls, roads, any part of the home, and even the deck. 
We utilized everyone's camera feeds to pinpoint Madam Cornell's exact location. As expected, we swiftly identified her current whereabouts. I observed her alertness heightening, seemingly aware of being watched. 
Well, her instincts were correct! 
Madam Cornell clearly didn't anticipate that there would be people nonchalantly using their phone cameras in her vicinity. 
"What are you doing? Are you taking my picture?" Madam Cornell scolded angrily, glaring at a nearby woman. 
"Excuse me? This older woman thinks she's a celebrity! Why would anyone photograph you? Tsk!" the woman retorted heatedly. 
I chuckled to myself at the woman's bewildered reaction.  
Lexi swiftly caught my attention. "She's calling you now, Sarah! 
"You mean your phone?" I smiled knowingly, tapping a button on my laptop to seamlessly forward the incoming call to Lexi's mobile device. 
We mirrored Lexi's phone display, ensuring we could vividly see her as Madam Cornell would perceive her on my laptop screen. 
Lexi confidently answered the video call, still on deck but using a filter that superimposed my face onto hers, pretending to be me. 
"Where are you?" Madam Cornell inquired, detecting nothing out of the ordinary so far. 
"I'm out on the deck," Lexi replied casually. 
Despite the nerve-wracking nature of our mission, I found it amusing to be comfortable aboard the yacht near the massive cruise ship, sipping juice with Assistant Alex and five bodyguards. Earlier, I had utilized a backdrop filter app to create the illusion that I was inside the cruise ship. 
"Where the fuck are you, Sarah?" Madam Cornell suddenly yelled, clearly panicked as she realized she couldn't actually see me physically present on the deck. 
"I'm right here," Lexi replied smoothly. 
"You fucking bitch! Show yourself to me immediately!" Madam Cornell grabbed Lexi's shoulder. But the furious lady was utterly stunned when someone else entirely turned to face her. 
Madam Cornell frantically swapped her gaze between her cellphone screen and the stranger standing before her, finally realizing I had been toying with her senses all along. 
"Sarah!!!" Madam Cornell bellowed, her face contorted with fury. "Are you playing games with me?! I swear, I'll kill Jane! You mark my words, I'll brutally kill Jane!" 
Onlookers on the deck began to notice Madam Cornell's escalating behavior, perceiving her as losing her composure. That's why we used our carefully planned decoy strategy, leveraging the unique app. 
The woman lunged at Lexi. In a quick response, Lexi skillfully put handcuffs on Madam Cornell's wrists. Madam Cornell looked shocked and couldn't believe what was happening. I think she finally realized she had been completely outsmarted. But just as Lexi was about to lock the handcuffs securely against the fence, Madam Cornell managed to break free and jumped into the sea desperately trying to escape. 
She thought she had managed to escape, but it's not
###chapter 104: Ctrl+Alt+Capture 
**Sarah** 

In an attempt to melt away the stress crushing me, I squeezed my eyes shut and pressed my back against the tanning bed. My heart hammered in my chest, and sweat beaded on my forehead. Then, a wave of dizziness slammed into me as the room began to whirl. 
"Are you alright?" Josh asked, noticing the change in my demeanor. His brow was furrowed with worry. 
"Yeah, I'm fine!" I smiled at him, though the stress was overwhelming.  
My phone rang, snapping me back to reality. I needed to keep it together and finish this job. Seeing Trey's name on the caller ID, I answered and put the call on speakerphone. 
"Trey?" 
Josh and the others listened intently, awaiting his report about the man who took the van out of the cruise. 
"We've caught Madam Cornell's man who drove the van out. He claimed his mother was in an emergency, which is why the staff allowed him to leave. Chairman's men were waiting at the gate and alerted the authorities to retrieve the money. The cruise is about to depart, but the police have coordinated with the management to delay its departure until Jane is safely secured," Trey reported. 
"Thanks for the hard work!" I managed to tell him before ending the call. 
Only a moment later, the Bluetooth earpiece crackled to life, and Emily and Bronn's voices made an announcement. 
"Sarah, we got Jane! The guy left guarding her room and tried to fight us. It's a good thing I brought some extra bodyguards." Bronn spoke in a rough, growling voice. 
"Looks like she's in trauma. Her condition isn't good" Emily added. 
My heart clenched at the thought of my friend suffering.  
"Jane, everything's fine" I heard Bronn say calmly, but I could hear her crying through the headset. I massaged my temples and took a deep breath to steady myself. 
"Lexi's on her way there," Jakob's voice crackled over. 
"Now, Jake, let's move on to the next phase!" I spoke with more confidence than I actually felt. 
"Got ya!" came his affirmative reply. 
Lexi had attached a GPS to Madam Cornell's handcuffs, and according to the tracking app we were both looking at, the vile woman was still at sea. I wouldn't be at ease until I was the one to catch that woman. 
Feeling bad, I ducked into the nearby cabin, sinking down onto the edge of the small bunk, where Josh helped me calm down. 
"Breathe in...breathe out..." he murmured soothingly. "Remember that panic attacks aren't good for your baby's condition," he reminded me. 
"I'm doing my best, Josh..." I replied, following his instructions on breathing deeply. 
He handed me a bottle of water. "I'll continue monitoring the handcuff's GPS tracking. It's better if you stay inside this cabin." 
"No! I'll do this!" I protested, shaking my head stubbornly.  
I had already promised myself that I would be the one to catch Madam Cornell, and I was so close to achieving what I was looking for. 
"Are you okay, Madam Sarah?" Assistant Alex asked, fixing the work Philip had left behind. He had been in the cabin for a while, anxious about what was happening. 
"I'm fine," I said, giving him a reassuring smile. 
"It would be better if you rest first, Madam Sarah," Assistant Alex urged. 
They looked at me pleadingly. Seeing I was outnumbered, I sighed and let them take over monitoring the laptop. I leaned back against the couch, closed my eyes, and focused on taking slow, deep breaths to regain my strength. 
A few moments later, the insistent beeping from the laptop grew louder; the three of us in the cabin were almost startled. Josh, Alex, and I exchanged glances. 
Then Jakob's voice crackled urgently in my earpiece, "Sarah, Madam Cornell is near the yacht!" 
"I know! Her GPS tracker is beeping like crazy-I think she's getting tired from swimming!" I replied. I had to ensure my yacht was her only rescuer at this crucial moment. 
I quickly lowered the laptop volume to make the beeping quieter and less noticeable. 
A few moments later, one of the guards came in. "Miss, Madam Cornell has boarded the yacht." 
"Good," I commented with grim satisfaction. 
All my companions on the yacht were Amir's guards except for Josh, so Madam Cornell didn't recognize the people on the deck who welcomed her exhausted form from the sea. 
I strode out onto the deck, followed by Assistant Alex and Josh. I could hear Madam Cornell dramatically telling the crew about her unfortunate experience. 
"I was kidnapped! I jumped off the ship to escape those shameless kidnappers," she cried dramatically. "Luckily, I found this yacht because I had such difficulty swimming further." 
With a detached calm, I watched her spin a web of lies. Her endurance, having crossed such a distance by water, was undeniable. Then again, I guessed demons had more than one life to spare. 
I shook my head, opening the wooden door that led out onto the yacht's deck. Raising my eyebrows, I clapped my hands slowly at her dramatic story. "Well, Madam Cornell, that was quite an entertaining tale!" 
Her eyes widened in shock. She was sitting in a lounge chair, wrapped in a plush white towel provided by my staff after her swim, holding a glass of cool water. 
Three of my burly guards swiftly blocked her path as they witnessed her panic and attempt to leap into the water. 
"Checkmate, Madam!" I calmly stated. 
She trembled, shocked to see me there, expecting me to be aboard the cruise. 
"Who are these people? Why are you here?" she shouted at me, unable to piece together what had happened. "You really are the devil's spawn!" 
"Madam, I own this yacht. As for who these people are they are my people," I replied casually. 
"Th-this is impossible! You're just a poor orphan, aren't you? Surely, you've sold yourself to some vile bastard! When Philip finds out, he'll abandon you!" she continued, her voice rising in hysteria. 
I approached until I was mere inches from her face, then delivered a sharp slap across her cheek. She stiffened, her eyes filled with resentment. 
"I'll kill you!" she screamed, struggling uselessly, held back by my guards, her limbs flailing like a trapped animal. Her eyes burned with rage, driven by a fierce desire to harm me. 
My anger towards my former mother-in-law burned within me. "Listen to me! I always wanted to make you pay for the suffering you inflicted! But I restrained myself because you were Philip's mother... even after you hurt my baby even after you ruined my life!" 
Tears welled up, and I fought off the panic attack gripping my chest as I confronted Madam Cornell. 
"I wanted to kill you then, Madam! To avenge the loss of my child! But I wouldn't allow myself to stoop to the level of a soulless monster like you!" I said bitterly, my voice thick with resentment and anger. The memories of her past cruelties tightened my lungs. 
"Philip will find out about this! I'll make sure he hates you!" she shouted angrily. 
"Oh? That's quite the news! Were you aware that Philip was the reason authorities were after you? How does it feel to be betrayed by your own son?" I calmly countered Madam Cornell, noting the narrowing of her eyes. 
Her lips agape in disbelief as she glanced at Josh and Assistant Alex, seeking confirmation of my words. Assistant Alex remained silent. Madam Cornell seemed unable to comprehend that her beloved Philip could gather evidence to imprison his own mother. 
"No! Not my Philip! You witch! You've bewitched my son! You shameless woman! Philip belongs to me! My son should only trust me!" she ranted, seeming to teeter on the edge of sanity. 
Ignoring her, I felt uneasy. I didn't want Madam Cornell to discover I was pregnant, a vulnerability I couldn't afford at that moment. 
By then, the yacht was nearly back to the port, just meters from the dock. Chairman Cornell awaited with a dark expression, flanked by his guards and authorities.  
Seeing his wife, Philip's father couldn't contain his rage, delivering several stinging slaps to the woman's face in a rage. 
Amidst the chaos, darkness enveloped me as I was escorted away, finally collapsing into the arms of the one who had been waiting for me all along...
###chapter 105: More Than Survival 
**Philip** 

Sarah's anguished cries reverberated through my unconsciousness, her voice distorted as if echoing inside a vast, hollow drum. I yearned to chase after it, to pinpoint its source and find her.  
Her confession about the baby filled her voice with fear, and I wanted to hug her, but I was being pulled back into darkness until her voice disappeared. 
After what felt like an eternity suspended in silent darkness, a searing light began to pull at the edges of my awareness. Gradually, painfully, my eyelids flickered open.  
Sensations immediately assaulted me. A hundred thousand needles seemed to pierce my back while the room blazed with an intense brightness. My head throbbed with pain, and I winced, wanting to curse, but it felt like something was lodged in my throat. 
"B-boss!" a voice called out. It had to be Erwan. He quickly went to the door. "D-Dr. Ethan! Boss Philip has regained consciousness!" 
A rush of footsteps and urgent voices filled the hallway outside. I looked around while they busied themselves with things I couldn't understand.  
Trying to sit up made the room spin, forcing me to squeeze my eyes shut against the dizziness. I closed my eyes to steady myself and felt a thick bandage wrapped around my head. Glancing to the side, I noticed the medical equipment surrounding me-IV lines in my arms; heart monitors beeping steadily, and other machines I couldn't identify. 
"Shit!" I hissed, desperately trying to piece together my fractured memories-the race... flashes of headlight... and then nothing but darkness. 
"Philip!" Ethan's voice called out. He entered with a doctor who began examining me, offering water to help me regain my senses. 
"What happened? Where is Sarah?" I asked as panic began to rise in my chest. The thought of her in Mariano's hands was terrifying. "Goddammit, Ethan, where is she?" My voice cracked with desperation as I tried again to sit up.  
Ethan's strong hands held me down, his face full of concern. 
"Easy, Philip! It would be best if you stayed still," he urged. "Sarah didn't go to Romania if you're worried about that. She was closely guarded. Well, at least, until..." 
"Ethan, what happened?" I demanded, the suspense killing me. 
"Not until Amir took Sarah to Dubai to ensure her safety," Ethan assured me. "Philip, you need to understand. You've been in a coma for nearly three weeks. At first, we couldn't even locate you..." 
Ethan explained everything that had happened, including the kidnapping of my sister Jane. This prompted Sarah to return to Serenity Pines Estate and strike a deal with my mother to deliver the ransom money. 
As the total weight of the situation hit me, I narrowed my eyes. "Are you saying Sarah was in mortal danger while I was lying here, as useless as a corpse?!" 
I attempted to stand, driven by a surge of adrenaline, but my weakened body betrayed me. Damn it! I need to regain my strength, but it seems impossible right now! 
"Take me to Neon Port!" I ordered the guard. I lashed out, unable to tolerate being forced to stay in bed. 
"Philip, for God's sake, calm down!" Ethan shouted, torn between his medical training and friendship. "You're too weak to charge in like this! They have a plan, and you need to trust your wife!" 
I grabbed his clothing and glared at him fiercely.  
"Ethan, if anything happens to her, it's my fault!" My voice cracked with frustration, and tears formed in my eyes.  
"You stubborn ass!" Ethan snapped, then sighed heavily. Shaking his head, he prepared an injection. "This will give you a temporary boost, but I'm warning you-you're pushing your body to its limits." 
Minutes later, Ethan and I got into his car, followed by another vehicle carrying my two guards. 
Ethan's car stopped at the port, and my vision began to clear. My body was still in pain, but I needed to be strong. The port was bustling with activity. A van had been halted, encircled by a flurry of authorities. Amid the commotion, I spotted a familiar figure. 
"Is that Chairman Cornell?" Ethan asked, shooting me a questioning glance. 
I wondered the same thing, suspecting my father was also here to save Jane. 
"Philip, it's best if you remain here," Ethan said, his voice laced with concern. "I don't have all the details of Sarah's plan, but I know she's not alone. Assistant Alex and Josh accompany her - they're there to ensure her safety. She's not as reckless as I thought. Mr. Martin and Sarah's beautiful assistant, Emily, are also involved in her plan." 
I was speechless! I felt like a crazy person, agonizing over the thought that Sarah might do everything to save Jane, even if she's alone! In fact, I even felt jealous of Jane because of my wife's deep love for her friend. 
"Fuck you, Ethan!" I exploded. "Why the hell didn't you tell me this sooner?" Our heated exchanges were nothing new. "I've been with you all along, imagining Sarah walking into a trap, handing over the ransom money to my mother all by herself!" 
"You didn't exactly ask, you rascal!" he retorted. 
Dismissing my annoying friend, I called the guard who was with us in the other vehicle. "I need you to find out exactly what's happening right now." 
I didn't want to risk surprising my father or causing unnecessary conflict if they saw me unexpectedly. 
A few minutes passed before the guard, accompanied by Trey, returned. 
"Boss!" Trey exclaimed, his eyes widening in surprise as he spotted me inside Ethan's car.  
"What's the current situation? I need details," I inquired. 
"Boss, we've successfully rescued Ms. Jane. Additionally, we apprehended another member of Madam Cornell's team with Mr. Martin's assistance. Currently, we're awaiting the return of Madam Sarah's yacht to port. Her team has successfully captured Madam Cornell herself." 
I closed my eyes tightly, letting the information sink in. A mix of relief and anxiety churned in my stomach. 
"Should I inform them of your presence here, boss?" Trey asked. 
"Is Sarah alright? Is she safe?" 
Trey nodded reassuringly. "She's fine, boss. She's not alone-there are five highly trained guards with her, courtesy of Mr. Benner's security team. They've been by her side this whole time." 
Unable to sit still any longer, I pushed open the car door and stepped out. The chill of the sea breeze hit me immediately, cutting through my jacket and making me shiver. My head was pounding, and I felt slightly nauseous, but I forced myself to stand still. I couldn't let anyone see how shaken I truly was. 
The guard and Ethan were there to support me. 
"They're here!" Ethan announced. 
I watched as Sarah descended towards the port with her group, bringing my mother, who seemed lost in her mind. As they approached, I noticed something wrong with Sarah. Her usual energy was gone, and her face looked unnaturally pale under the bright port lights. 
Moments later, she collapsed, her legs giving way like a melting candle. Without thinking, I lunged forward, catching her just before she hit the ground, cradling her unconscious form against my chest.  
A collective gasp swept through the crowd, their confusion palpable as they struggled to understand why I had appeared. 
"B-boss!" Alex exclaimed. 
"Shall I take her?" Josh asked, looking directly at me for permission. 
'This guy!' I thought to myself.  
He probably assumed I hadn't noticed his feelings for Sarah. The idea of him holding my wife made my blood boil. With a narrowed gaze, I chose to ignore his request. 
"Philip!" My mother's shrill voice broke the tension. Her eyes, wild with desperation, locked onto mine. "Philip! Help me! Don't let them capture me! I'll die in prison, Philip! That woman has poisoned your mind!" 
I wanted to leave. The woman I once thought was my mother never gave a damn about me. During my disappearance or my time in a coma, she was busy scheming, maybe even when I was knocking on death's door. Her concern was more about money than my well-being. 
Ending our relationship decisively, I declared, "I will ensure you end up in jail, Mom. This is the price for destroying Sarah's life." 
Her eyes widened, and she screamed, losing control at the port. But I had already turned away, her cries fading into background noise. 
Placing Sarah gently in the car, I prepared to take her back to Serenity Pines...
###chapter 106: Symphony of Kisses 
**Sarah** 
I regained consciousness lying in bed. The room was dark, with only a faint light from outside reflecting within. I touched my forehead and glanced around, realizing I was in a guest room at Serenity Pines Estate. 
Exhaling slowly, I recalled arms catching me and Philip's scent before I blacked out. Exhaustion must have overwhelmed me. Suddenly, a wave of panic hit me.  
"Oh no! Jane!" I shouted, remembering my friend was in trouble. 
As soon as my hand touched the cool metal of the doorknob, a deep voice from the open balcony made me freeze. 
"Where do you think you're going?" The unexpected sound sent a shiver down my spine. 
I spun around my heart racing, and saw Philip's tall figure against the starry night sky. The moonlight highlighted his broad shoulders and messy hair. 
"P-Philip?" I stammered. 
He walked towards me confidently, commanding the room with his presence. As he came closer, I saw the intensity in his deep, dark eyes-a blend of concern and a hint of something more profound. His hand reached out, gently cupping my cheek with warmth and tenderness. 
"I told you I'd see you again." 
Tears welled in my eyes, a mix of emotions stirring inside me. He gently laid my head on his chest. I breathed in his scent, gripping his shirt as if to hold onto this moment forever. Philip kissed my forehead softly, and I found myself rendered speechless, still trying to grasp the reality of his presence. 
"I'm sorry if you're getting exhausted because of my family," he murmured, his breath warm against my hair. "This isn't what I wanted for you." 
As tears began to spill down my cheeks, Philip continued, his voice thick with regret, "I'm truly sorry, my love. I promised I wouldn't make you cry anymore, yet here you are, shedding tears because of me again." 
"It's just that I miss our banter, you brute!" I retorted, hitting him on the chest. 
"And I've missed seeing that fiery temper of yours," he replied, a smile evident in his tone. "You're still the bravest woman who ever dared to scold me, called me an idiot and a lunatic to my face." 
I couldn't help but giggle. 
"I heard you managed to escape and wanted to go to Romania because you made a deal with Madam Olsen," he murmured. 
"Yes But I can't take such risks, Philip. I'm pregnant." 
He froze, lowering his gaze to meet my eyes. 
I took a deep breath before continuing, "That day, I didn't hesitate to choose our child. I can't bear to relive what happened before - I nearly lost my mind. I have to do what's right. I have to-" 
My words were cut short as Philip suddenly leaned in, his lips capturing mine in a passionate kiss.  
His lips, which I had yearned for days to meet, finally touched mine, calming the turmoil inside my chest. Emotions surged as our lips connected. His fingers gently caressed my hair, and then he pulled me into a tighter embrace. 
When we finally parted, Philip gazed at me with a tenderness I had only dreamed of during our previous marriage.  
"Philip, we need to keep this baby a secret. For now, only Josh, Assistant Alex, and my family in Dubai know I'm pregnant-" 
"What?" His expression winced instantly. 
"Yes. I remember you telling me Mariano shouldn't know about our remarriage. I'm not sure how I'll hide this, but I'll do everything I can to keep our baby healthy." 
Hold on..." He stepped back, frowning. "Are you saying Josh knew about your pregnancy before I did?" 
"Well..." I couldn't help it-Josh is a doctor! It's not my fault he saw the baby's heartbeat in my pulse! This rascal got jealous before understanding my situation! 
"No, this isn't right. We need to tell him there's been a mistake. I can't accept that my bodyguard found out before me!" 
I was speechless, staring at him incredulously. "You're unbelievable!" My earlier tenderness gave way to frustration.  
Turning on my heel, I strode towards the door. 
"Sarah!" Philip called after me, following me into the hallway. "You can't do this to me. I should have been the first to know." 
"You and your small dick energy! Stop being ridiculous and take me to Jane!" I scolded Philip. 
He pulled me close again, his strong arms encircling my waist. His lips met mine in a tender kiss. As we parted, his eyes sparkled with mischief.  
"Let's keep this between us. Agreed? You'll stay here in Serenity Pines; promise me you'll care for yourself and the baby. Oh, And one more condition-I demand at least ten kisses daily. Non-negotiable." 
"Oh, for heaven's sake!" I sighed, stepping back from him. Despite my exasperation, I couldn't help but feel relieved that Philip was regaining his strength. As I descended the grand staircase of Serenity Pines, my stomach growled insistently, reminding me that I hadn't eaten in hours. 
Heading straight to the kitchen, I scavenged for food, checking the fridge like a thief, unable to tame my hunger. I should have brought Amanda! 
"By the way, where is my team? Lexi, Jakob, Emily, and Bronn?" I asked Philip, my brow furrowing in concern. 
"Are you hungry?" he asked, brushing off my question. 
"Yes!" I admitted, feeling suddenly childish as I turned to face him, my cheeks flushing. 
He approached and peeked into the fridge. "What would you like? I could have ordered lobster if you'd like." 
"No, I need something now! A big, juicy sausage, maybe?" I pouted. 
"Hmm... my particular sausage isn't on the menu at the moment," he teased. 
I felt heat rising to my cheeks. "You brute! I meant actual food, not your dick!" 
Philip grabbed a pack of sausages. "Alright, alright... I'll fix something for you. Just sit back and admire my handsome face." 
I followed him as he prepared the meal, frying the sausages and slicing fruit, offering it to me first. 
Guilt suddenly washed over me as I realized I hadn't even asked about his condition. "How are you feeling?" I blurted out. "Aren't you weak after being bedridden for so long?" 
"I've been a bit nauseous," he replied. "Ethan gave me steroids and vitamins earlier before you woke up. It's helped, but I'm not back to full strength yet." 
I looked closely at him. The coma had clearly made him leaner. Despite that, he was here cooking for me, acting like everything was normal. 
But I enjoyed the attention. Despite my attempts to resist, I secretly liked how he doted on me like this. 
*** 
After dinner, I asked Philip to drive me to Cornell Mansion, where Jane was currently staying. Despite the late hour, I was concerned for my friend and wanted to ensure she was alright, eager to see her. 
The butler graciously received us upon entering the grand mansion. Some household staff appeared surprised by our unexpected arrival, perhaps unaware of the recent events. 
I made my way to Jane's room, familiar with its location, while Philip was summoned by his father to the library. Reaching Jane's door, I took a deep breath before knocking softly and turning the knob. 
The room was brightly lit, and every lamp was turned on, seemingly to keep away shadows. Jane lay still on the bed, her eyes fixed on the detailed ceiling above.  
"How are you, love?" I asked gently, approaching her and giving her a hug. 
Jane's eyes sparkled with tears as she sat up quickly.  
"Sarah..." she sobbed, her body trembling against mine. 
"You're so brave. You managed to escape from that terrible woman," I reassured her, wanting her to understand she wasn't to blame and that she was courageous. 
Tears streamed down her face. "I was terrified. She threatened to throw me into the sea, to kill you if I said anything. I'm scared to be alone..." 
I soothingly rubbed her back. "I'm here with you," I promised, hoping to calm her. I held Jane's hand until we both drifted off to sleep on her bed. 
The following day, Philip appeared sullen from having spent the night alone in his room. But I no longer cared about him. I felt a renewed sense of strength knowing Madam Cornell was behind bars, LoveLogic was doing excellent, and I was confident Jane would soon be back with us.

**Emily**  

As I held my daughter, memories of the last time Bronn and I were together four years ago flooded my mind. 
"Do you love me, Mr. Martin?" 
He stared back at me, devoid of any emotion. "I'm paying you to play my lover. You know perfectly well your part in this messed up situation."
###chapter 107: Counting Pennies 
**Emily**  
*Seven years ago; when I first met Bronn...* 
Summit Valley University is renowned for its rigorous academic programs and sprawling campus. I feel incredibly fortunate to have been accepted here.  
My mother was hospitalized for a heart condition while my father passed away just a month ago, leaving a significant void in my life and finances. Adding to the grief, most of his estate, including the family business and properties, went to my half-sister Erica, his legitimate child. As his child from a long-term affair, I was left with memories and growing financial responsibilities.  
Desperate for a solution, I had taken a bus to Los Angeles, hoping against hope that Erica might show some sisterly compassion. The mansion that greeted me was a painful reminder of the life I'd once been adjacent to but never truly part of.  
"Erica, please... I need your help!" I pleaded desperately with my half-sister as I visited her in the mansion, hoping she would empathize with my situation. Her home, once mine too, was adorned with beautiful furnishings. She couldn't fathom my audacity to ask for assistance.  
"Emily, how dare you show up here! You have no right to ask me for anything. Do you expect me to hand over money to the living reminder of my father's betrayal?" She turned to the guard and ordered, "Ensure she doesn't intrude again! Her presence gives me a migraine!"  
With a heavy heart, she pushed me out, rejecting my plea for support. Disheartened by her cold dismissal, I reluctantly left Los Angeles to return to Henderson, where Summit Valley University awaited.  
While sitting on the bus, I received a message from my mentor, Mrs. Frost: Mr. Bronn Martin, the young heir of BM Technologies, would be our keynote speaker at the Business Week program. I'm assigning you, along with Mr. Finnegan Steele and Miss Ezra Stormwind, to assist with this high-profile event. This could be an excellent networking opportunity for you.  
Curious about Mr. Martin, I researched him online. The search results showed pictures of a very attractive young man. He was always dressed in expensive suits, suggesting he was pretty wealthy. His bright blue eyes and confident smile seemed to jump out at me from the screen.  
To my surprise, the bio listed his age as only 28-far younger than I'd expected for someone in his position.  
It was fascinating, but I pushed thoughts of him aside, focusing on the pressing matter of completing my education. My dad sent me to this fancy school, thinking I'd finish my degree here. But now, with only a job at a coffee shop, graduating feels out of reach.  
***  
Damn! My eyes snapped open, heart pounding, as I realized my big mistake. The clock showed past eight in the morning, glaring at me accusingly. Panic swept over me as I remembered what today meant-the beginning of Business Week and my responsibility as Mr. Martin's assistant.  
"Damn it!" I cursed, hurriedly got out of bed. 
The program starts at nine, which wouldn't have been a problem if Mrs. Frost hadn't assigned me a particular task. My late-night shift at The Grind, followed by a study session, had clear consequences: I was now sleep-deprived and frantic. I hurriedly showered, grabbed the first decent outfit, and rushed out the door. Makeup would have to wait; I could only manage a quick swipe of sunscreen.  
As I sprinted across campus, my phone kept buzzing non-stop. I glanced at the messages, each one increasing my anxiety:  
***Message 1:*** *Emily, where are you? Mrs. Frost is looking for you!*  
***Message 2:*** *We've got a full house waiting to hear from Mr. Martin's speech!*  
***Message 3, Also, from my roommate Evelyn:*** *Emily, I have to go home to Pennsylvania for a week due to family problems. You're in charge of the apartment for now. See you soon!*  
The last message made me pause momentarily: Thank you for submitting your application to the BM Technologies Scholarship Program. Our team will now carefully review all applications. We will announce our decision on August 5th at 8:00 PM. Best regards!  
My stomach churned with a mix of hope and dread. This scholarship was my lifeline, my chance to stay at Summit Valley without working myself to the bone. In my application, I poured out my heart, detailing my circumstances and burning desire to complete my education despite the obstacles. My transcripts and recommendations were impeccable-they had to be, given how hard I'd worked.  
I headed straight to Mrs. Frost's office since I was supposed to assist Mr. Martin.  
I received another message from Finn: *Emily, what the heck? Mr. Martin is already in Mrs. Frost's office, and you're still not there!*  
***Me:*** *Sorry, guys! I'm here at Mrs. Frost's office now!*  
Bursting into the office, my heart pounding. The office was filled with the rich smell of freshly brewed coffee coming from an elegant carafe on the center table. Books and papers were scattered messily across my advisor's mahogany desk, but there was no sign of Mr. Martin or anyone else.  
"Damn! Where are they?"  
Before I could message my classmates, I was drawn to the mouth-watering sight of a clubhouse sandwich and coffee on the table. My stomach reminded me I hadn't eaten yet, and I winced.  
Glancing around, I noted the absence of CCTV cameras in the room; Mrs. Frost's office was just a simple mini-library. However, surveillance was in the hallway, which could track visitors' movements.  
The sandwich seemed to call my name. Surely, they wouldn't notice if I took just one bite? My friends might assume Mr. Martin had helped himself.  
Okay, this is probably stealing, but I need to eat!  
'Yeah, passing out from hunger during his keynote speech seemed far worse,' I urged myself.  
"Uhmm! Darn, this is so good!" I moaned softly as I took my first bite. Whoever had prepared this was a culinary genius.  
With my hunger finally satisfied, I considered asking where our guest was. I turned, intending to peek into the hallway, when I nearly collided with a towering figure.  
"M-M-Mr. Martin!" I choked out, my eyes widening in shock. The man before me bore little resemblance to the photos I'd seen online. In person, he was... magnetic!  
Piercing blue eyes, golden hair, and an aura of quiet authority that made my knees weak.  
He looked at me momentarily, then glanced at the half-eaten sandwich in my hand.  
"I-I-It's not what it looks like!" I stammered, my heart pounding. "I just... I mean, I didn't!"  
"It's fine," he said, his deep voice sending a shiver down my spine. He moved past me, settling onto the leather couch with ease. You can finish it and then tell me how it tastes."  
"S-sir?"  
His eyes met mine, dark and intense.  
At that moment, uncertainty gripped me. Forcing myself to swallow the last bite, I struggled to maintain composure.  
"How old are you?" he finally asked, breaking the tense silence.  
Startled, I stuttered, "N-nineteen, sir."  
He simply nodded, his expression unreadable. My mind raced. Did he think I was immature? Or worse, was he considering the legal implications of my impulsive act?  
My mind raced with anxious possibilities until the door swung open.  
My advisor, Mrs. Elaine Foster, bustled in, her salt-and-pepper hair slightly disheveled.  
"Mr. Martin! There you are," she exclaimed, relief evident in her voice. "I've been searching everywhere. I was told you'd returned to the office." Her eyes darted to me. "I hope Miss Carter has been assisting you properly?"  
Mr. Martin's gaze lingered on me. "She's been... most accommodating."  
Together, we walked towards the lecture hall where the speech would occur.  
"Oh, by the way, Miss Carter," Mr. Martin remarked casually, "you have a bit of mayonnaise on your lips. You might want to wipe it off before anyone notices."  
My face burned with embarrassment. I quickly dabbed at my mouth, wishing the floor would open up and swallow me whole.  
Before August 5th, I received a call from BM Technologies Charity's office about my scholarship application. They'd informed me, much to my shock, that I'd been selected for a personal interview with Bronn Martin himself.  
Little did I know how our paths would continue intertwining from that point onward.
###chapter 108: Deal with Dignity 
**Bronn**  

Emily Carter... the woman who lingered in my thoughts long after we last saw each other. Her natural scent, plump lips with a touch of mayonnaise, dark coffee-colored hair, tiny waist, and even the curve of her breast beneath a thick top-all of her simplicity haunted my mind like a persistent virus.  
Perhaps I was a werewolf in a past life. 
"Bronn, I know my granddaughter is still too young for you, but it's fine. Sarah is a nice young woman. She's working hard on different things," Grandpa Mitchell interrupted, his weathered face creasing with a knowing smile. As my longtime mentor in finance and stock market strategy, his words held significant influence. 
"Bronn is doing really well, too. He's made a name for himself in the tech industry. You don't need to worry about either of them," my mom said, smiling nicely. 
"Thank you for accepting us, Grandpa Mitchell," I simply said. 
"I will send a thoughtful gift to Sarah," my dad added. 
Sarah was just sixteen, a detail that everyone else seemed to overlook. She was still in high school, after all! The thought of any romantic involvement was not just improbable but entirely out of the question. I had no interest in her that way, and I was sure any advances would only make her uncomfortable at family events. 
Maybe if she became older? 
This wasn't new. Parents always have a say in their children's marital prospects, often under the guise of protecting family interests. Sarah's mind seemed to be conditioned early that the two of us would marry someday.  
But sixteen? Damn it! It also meant that I would have to wait several more years before anything could even be considered appropriate. 
On the private jet back to Henderson, Robert, my secretary, handed me his iPad. "Boss, here is the list of applicants for the BM Technologies educational program from Summit Valley." 
Taking it with a frown, my eyes going straight to a name I didn't expect. I even put on my glasses to ensure I wasn't seeing things.  
I reviewed Emily Carter's profile. She is a nineteen-year-old business course student. I also examined her grades and cover letter, which explains why she needs the scholarship in full.  
"Please investigate more about Emily Carter," I instructed Robert. 
"Understood." 
*** 
**Emily** 

As I stepped into the imposing lobby of BM Technologies, a tall, well-dressed man approached me with a professional smile. "Miss Carter? I'm Robert, Mr. Martin's executive assistant. Please follow me." 
Robert guided me through a series of sleek, modern corridors. Most of the office spaces we passed were divided by mirrored panels, giving the illusion of vastness. Eventually, we reached a room with solid walls, a rare sight in this glass-dominated environment. 
As I walked in, my attention was instantly drawn to a plate on the main table. Four neatly cut triangles of clubhouse sandwiches sat there, incredibly tempting. Seeing them brought back a clear memory-this was definitely the same sandwich I had eaten when Mr. Martin visited our school.  
'No, Emily! This has to be a trap!' 
Mr. Bronn Martin entered confidently, filling the room with his presence. As I stood up, our eyes locked, and I felt a lump in my throat. I couldn't deny it-this man exuded an overpowering presence. 
"My apologies for being late; I just came from another meeting," he said. 
"It's... fine." Was I really going to complain about a three-minute wait with the head of BM Technologies? 
Mr. Martin's gaze flicked to the untouched food.  
"Please, help yourself," he encouraged, gesturing to the sandwiches. 
"I-I-It's fine!" I stammered, convinced this must be some test. But then my stomach betrayed me with a loud rumble. 
His expression soured. "I'm serious. Please finish the sandwich," he insisted, taking a seat on the couch. 
I quickly grabbed a slice and ate it nervously. He watched me without speaking, as though my purpose here was to be fed. 
My cheeks flushed as I finished eating, acutely conscious of each bite and swallow. 
"You can also finish that coffee," he remarked. 
Obediently, I drank it all, feeling his eyes on me. 
The silence between us grew thick and tense. Time slipped away as I was in an unusual staring match with one of the country's most influential men. Robert abruptly broke the moment, delivering a stack of papers to Mr. Martin and quietly exiting as he had entered. 
Gathering my courage, I spoke up. "M-Mr. Martin, I was under the impression this was an interview..." 
"I understand this is unusual," he began. "But I invited you here for a different purpose." 
He held out the papers Robert had just delivered. 
My mind was consumed with thoughts of the role in his company's prestigious educational program, but the shocking contents of the document shattered my excitement. 
I was horrified when the contract said I would be his mistress until I finished university.  
"I'm sorry, but this isn't what it seems, Mr. Martin! I'm not a prostitute!" I exclaimed, my voice quivering with a mix of confusion and frustration.  
Is this inappropriate? 
Is he married? Does he have a girlfriend? The way he looks at me, it feels like there could be something more brewing between us. 
I value my education, but not like this. My body trembles with dismay. I used to view this man as wealthy yet respectable. 
Yet all he said was, "I understand. I apologize." 
His response gave me pause. In reality, he hadn't crossed any lines with me. No inappropriate touches, no harassment-it's all in my head. 
"Wh-why? Why are you making me this offer, Mr. Martin?" I asked, trying to grasp his intentions. 
"Because I want to fuck you" he said calmly, with sincerity in his voice, yet restrained, his dark blue eyes locking onto mine. 
My heart raced as I absorbed his words.  
How should a woman react to such remarks from Mr. Bronn Martin?  
Ever since our last encounter, I have delved into his background, and his profile initially portrayed him in a positive light. According to my research, he had three previous girlfriends, all rumored to have been primarily interested in his wealth. He has been unattached for the past year. 
'I want to fuck you...' 
Mr. Martin's words echoed in my ears, sending me an unexpected shiver. Despite my best efforts to maintain composure, a rush of conflicting emotions coursed through my body. 
"I..." I stammered. 
"I'm really sorry if I offended you," he winced. "This is actually the first time I've proposed this kind of agreement. I realize now I was so focused on protecting myself that I didn't consider how it might affect you." 
Protecting himself? It might have something to do with his ex-girlfriends. I felt sorry for Bronn, wondering why he had to resort to this. 
Mr. Martin stood up and headed towards the large table in the distance. "Please don't worry about your scholarship application. The finalists will still be announced as scheduled." 
"Are you seeing someone, Mr. Martin?" I asked, curiosity burning inside me. 
Once again, he stared at me for a long moment, probably trying to figure out why I brought up such a question. 
"If I were seeing someone, Miss Carter, you wouldn't have received this offer." 
Does this mean he's safe? Still, it was followed quickly by a wave of panic. This situation was utterly unfamiliar and terrifying to me. 
Feeling overwhelmed, I collected my things and made my way to the door. I couldn't muster the words to bid him farewell. Stepping out of the BM Technologies building, I suddenly noticed I was still holding onto the contract tightly in my arms. 
My thoughts were disturbed by a call from Los Angeles. It was the hospital where my mother was admitted. 
My heart rate, which had just begun to slow, immediately spiked again.
###chapter 109: Threads of Courage 
**Emily** 

Notifying the coffee shop of my emergency, I informed them that I couldn't make it to The Grind. Immediately, I hurried to the hospital where my mom had been admitted.  
It was there that I encountered Dr. Vanderbilt, my mother's surgeon. Despite his salt and pepper hair, his face defied his age, exuding a handsome charm. 
"I apologize for reaching out to you so suddenly, Miss Carter," he began gently. "You are listed as the immediate contact for your mother after... your father passed away last month." 
I sensed Dr. Vanderbilt struggling to maintain composure. My lips quivered.  
"W-what's going on, doctor?" 
He guided me to a quiet corner. "Your mother's condition is stable, but we've encountered a different issue. The monthly funds supporting her admission have ceased since last month. As of now, your family owes the hospital twenty thousand dollars." 
Mixed emotions surged within me-fear, resentment, self-pity... This must be related to my dad's death. Erica must have stopped paying for my mother's expenses. 
Dr. Vanderbilt continued reluctantly, "I hate to burden you with this, but the ongoing care your mother needs-medications, procedures, treatments, emergency interventions-requires at least fifty thousand dollars a month."  
Tears welled up in my eyes, and I couldn't hold them back. Dr. Vanderbilt quickly offered me a tissue and a cup of water from a nearby cooler. 
"I'm truly sorry, Miss Carter The hospital administration has informed me that if funds aren't provided soon, we'll have no choice but to transfer Mrs. Carter to a state facility." 
The thought of losing Mom so soon after Dad was unbearable. 
"Please," I begged, "give me five days. I'll find a way to make the payment." 
Dr. Vanderbilt nodded, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. He knew our family's mansion and the business Dad had left behind. All I needed now was to confront Erica and resolve this situation. 
I retreated to the hospital restroom and allowed myself to cry. Mom shouldn't see me like this. 
Staying calm, I walked to her room. Through the small window on the door, I saw her lying in bed, surrounded by machines and monitors. Despite her frail appearance, she was smiling and chatting with a nurse, nibbling on what appeared to be lime Jell-O. 
My mother was so brave... I needed to be, too. 
Despite the worry churning in my stomach, I managed to smile as I entered the ward. 
"Mom!" I exclaimed, pushing the door open with forced cheerfulness. 
"Emily..." Her face lit up, though I couldn't ignore her thinness and how age seemed to have caught up with her. 
I hurried across the room quickly, careful not to disturb the tangled IV lines. "I missed you a lot! I had to come see you!" 
"How's school, sweetheart? Have you been skipping classes? It's quite a long drive from your college. You shouldn't miss lectures if you visit me, a phone call would have enough," she murmured, her concern evident in her slow speech. 
Inside, I felt like I was falling apart. The contrast between how I looked on the outside and felt inside was overwhelming.  
How do you maintain a façade of happiness when your world falls apart? The desire to collapse and reveal everything felt almost too strong to resist. 
"I'm doing great, Mom!" I replied with forced enthusiasm. "Didn't you miss me, and that's why you wanted me to visit?" 
She smiled warmly. "Of course I missed you. You're my greatest joy." 
We chatted about simple things like the weather, hospital food, and the kind nurses until Mom brought up something unexpected. 
"So, you're nineteen now. I'm sure there are boys at school... Tell me about it," she prompted. 
Bronn came to mind, but I chose not to share anything about him with my mom. 
*** 
The contract says Bronn would support my schooling-all fees. Aside from that, I will also get a one hundred thousand monthly allowance.  
I will accompany him whenever necessary, live with him on his estate, or wherever he may take me. 
No sex during the monthly period, and I can definitely tell him if I'm not in the mood or I'm not feeling well. Mr. Martin has the right to terminate this contract anytime, even before I graduate. However, it states that his scholarship program will cover my educational fees until I finish my studies. 
I feel nauseous while reading the contents. 
I had two boyfriends; one when I was fifteen-puppy love, while the next one was during my last year in high school. I never engaged in any sexual activities with them, so this is very unfamiliar.  
My cellphone vibrated, its screen illuminating with an unexpected message from Robert, Mr. Martin's assistant. I felt a twinge of anxiety. Did this mean I had to coordinate everything with Robert? 
The message read: 'Good evening, Miss Carter. This is Robert Kingsley from Mr. Bronn Martin's office. The boss would like to invite you to join him for dinner at The Sapphire Hotel this Saturday at 8:00 PM. The restaurant is known for its cozy ambiance and delicious cuisine. Please dress comfortably, but do note that the hotel has a smart-casual dress code. Something appropriate for a nice dinner setting would be perfect.' 
My expression soured. I never expected Mr. Bronn Martin's invitation to be so... impersonal. It felt more like a business meeting than a date. 
"How can you even call it a date, Emily?" I scolded myself. "It's probably just an apology dinner." 
The weight of obligation settled on my shoulders as I sighed, resigned to the fact that I had no choice but to meet them. The money indicated would help clear the hospital bills quickly. 
Digging through my wardrobe, I found a floral dress that seemed decent enough-a reminder of the days when I had money to shop now and then. 
"Wow, a date?" Evelyn, my roommate, exclaimed. She was sprawled on the couch, munching on popcorn and binge-watching her latest obsession on our shared TV. 
"It's for a scholarship interview I applied for. Mr. Bronn Martin will be interviewing me tonight," I lied hastily. 
"Mr. Bronn Martin?" Her face lit up. "The guy everyone at school is talking about? They say he's incredibly handsome! And you have a date with him?" 
"Evelyn, focus-it's an interview! Sheesh!" 
She gave me a once-over. "Oh no, no, no! You can't wear that! Even if it's an interview, you still want to impress him to ace your application! This dress... you look like you're going to a Sunday school picnic!" 
Before I could object, Evelyn dashed to her room, returning moments later with an armful of clothes. "Here, try this on instead!"  
I tried on Evelyn's dress, hesitating as I examined my reflection. The two-piece ensemble consisted of a sleeveless top covering my chest modestly but exposing my waist. The skirt reached my knees, with a subtle slit that hinted at my thighs. 
Evelyn exclaimed, "This is perfect! Sexy, yet still conservative. Enjoy the night, roomie. If I were the one receiving that invitation, I might wear something even shorter and spicier!" 
*** 
When I arrived, Robert was waiting at the hotel entrance. He greeted me with a neutral expression and didn't remark how I looked. He guided me through the grand lobby to a secluded restaurant section. 
Mr. Martin's expression darkened when he saw me. Nonetheless, he remained a gentleman, helping me to my seat before taking his own. 
My lips quivered as I looked at him. Truth be told, my attraction to him had intensified, and the idea of being admired by Bronn Martin made me weak. 
The waiter arrived with our food, and I couldn't help but dig in, realizing how hungry I was. Mr. Martin ate occasionally while his gaze stayed on me with an unreadable expression. 
Seriously, what was the real purpose of this meeting? Had he invited me to dinner to gaze at me?  
A violinist began playing nearby, and Bronn invited me to dance. 
My heart raced as I focused on him in the music's light. This is definitely a date!  
Could it be that Bronn genuinely liked me? 
When the music stopped, he cupped my cheeks, his thumb gently tracing my lower lip. The intimacy of the gesture left me gasping, and I found myself leaning into his touch, silently yearning for more. 
Soon, his lips crashed into mine, igniting a flurry of emotions in my heart. 
I must admit, I yearn for Mr. Bronn Martin! 
For the first time, I find myself lost in a fantasy-willing to surrender to him, whatever the consequence!
###chapter 110: The Price of Him 
**Emily** 

My heart pounded as Mr. Bronn Martin and I stood in the elevator. His fingers had been tracing patterns on my waist for a while, their touch warm and burning against my exposed skin.  
I remembered his whispers in my ear, "Would you like to join me in my room?"  
I nodded, meeting his gaze and bringing us to the elevator. Robert accompanied us, calmly carrying his boss's things. 
When the suite door opened, I was greeted by a beautiful unit. It featured a spacious living area, a kitchen, several rooms, and an outdoor pool surrounded by lush Bermuda grass. I walked to the glass wall, taking in the breathtaking view of the city below. It was hard to believe such a place existed inside a hotel. 
As I feasted my eyes on the glittering lights outside, I suddenly felt hands squeezing my waist, followed by the warmth of his presence behind me. 
Mr. Martin's lips brushed against the sensitive curve of my ear, and I closed my eyes, gasping at the heat of his breath against my skin. As I tilted my face towards him, his mouth met mine, his tongue exploring with a compelling intimacy.  
In that delicious moment, I forgot everything around me, lost in the exquisite sensation of his kiss. 
Mr. Martin's kiss deepened, igniting a fiery passion within me. As our connection intensified, a warm sensation began to swirl in my lower abdomen, fueling a desire to reciprocate his intensity.  
His hands, strong and confident, traced the contours of my smooth, exposed back, and I felt the cool air against my skin where he had already undone the zipper of my top. 
"I imagined this all day, Emily" he murmured, gazing at me while panting from the extended exchange of kisses. 
My heart fluttered with anticipation, for I felt the same longing. In my mind, I envisioned how Mr. Bronn Martin would worship me, imagining the sweetness of his kisses and tender caresses. 
His hand gently cradled my jaw, his lips tracing a path from my collarbone to the sensitive curve of my ear. The scent of his expensive cologne enveloped me, sending shivers of delightful anticipation through my trembling lips. 
"Ohh..." I couldn't suppress a soft moan of pleasure. Suddenly, a cool breeze brushed against me because my top slipped entirely off my shoulders. 
I swallowed, feeling my cheeks flush as I met his gaze directly. I instinctively crossed my arms over my chest, feeling a mix of awkwardness and vulnerability. 
"Why are you hiding them? They were perfect..." His voice held genuine confusion, puzzled by my sudden embarrassment. 
"Mr. Martin, I I'm not I haven't had a sexual experience yet," I murmured, unable to look at him after confessing. 
He hesitated for a fleeting moment. I panicked, afraid it might cause him to reject me. 
"A-are you mad?" I asked. 
He shook his head. "Should I be mad at you?" He paused but gazed at me intensely. "But do you want this, Emily?" 
I nodded eagerly at his question. My nipples were erect, craving, pleading for his touch. 
"Don't worry. I will be gentle..." he murmured. 
We shared another tender kiss, lost in each other's embrace. His touch grazed my skirt, skillfully unzipping it until I stood in nothing but my cotton panties.  
By the expansive floor-to-ceiling glass wall, he gently lifted me and carried me into one room, where a massive bed awaited; it could easily accommodate five people. 
His fingers delicately caught the edge of my last garment, gliding down my legs. The anticipation in his eyes, his breath, and everything about him mesmerized me. 
"Beautiful..." he murmured, admiring my two perky breasts as I lay on the white sheets. 
With deliberate care, he shed each piece of clothing, draping them on a nearby rack without averting his gaze from mine. 
My lips quivered as I observed his graceful motions-how he unbuttoned his shirt, slipped off his trousers, and finally, his boxer briefs until he stood before me, completely naked. 
His manhood was hard, thick causing me to gulp.  
I couldn't tear my eyes away from him as he gracefully settled onto the bed. The gentle touch of his fingertip traced my cheek while his gaze worshipped my skin... 
How Mr. Martin's eyes adore every inch of my body never ceases to amaze me. 
"You are perfect, Emily Just the way you are in my fucking dreams" he murmured before his mouth landed on my one hard nipple.  
The sensation coursing through me made my body jerk and shiver. 
"Ahh..." My body arched, drawing my chest closer to his moist lips. He tenderly trailed his tongue over the other, teasing my nipple with gentle flicks.  
I closed my eyes, feeling how good it was! While his manhood occasionally touches my legs. My throat tightened in anticipation of the impending pleasure, gasping as his lips trailed over my shoulder. 
"These lips... should only be mine, Emily..." he whispered, his thumb caressing my lower lip. "You will moan only my name, no one else... I alone will worship your body and no one else..." 
His insistent mouth crashed against mine again, igniting a fire that consumed my thoughts. In that fleeting embrace, all I desired was to surrender myself entirely to him, to let the rising tide of passion carry us away. 
I crave him... 
I want Bronn Martin! 
His knee gently parted my legs, his eyes locking onto mine with a tender intensity. In that fleeting moment, I couldn't help but arch involuntarily as his fingertips brushed against my exquisitely sensitive slit, where myriad pleasures converged, unleashing a wave of unfamiliar yet blissful joy. 
"Ohhhh! It felt good, Mr. Martin" My words spilled forth, my hand finding refuge on his shoulder. 
His lips brushed softly against my neck once again, sending shivers through me, while his fingers tenderly brought pleasure inside me. My nails unconsciously gently grazed his back. 
"I'm preparing you, Emily," he murmured against my skin, "so it won't be too painful." 
"Ah..." I gasped, savoring the delicious sensation, my eyes swirling with desire. It wasn't long before I yearned for more of that exquisite intimacy. 
"I want you, Mr. Martin" In my eyes lay the longing. 
Without hesitation, he fulfilled my desire. In an instant, he shifted closer, the tip of his manhood aligning perfectly with my wet, sensitive slit. Anticipation coursed through me, painting vivid scenes of what was to come. 
"Ahhh!" I gasped softly as I felt his thick shaft gently easing, dominating my inner muscles.  
It didn't take long before I felt entirely him inside me. 
"It felt so fucking good inside you Shhh" His soothing and gentle voice caressed my ears as he tenderly stroked my hair. Tears welled in my eyes as I felt his presence deeply.  
Bronn's sweet kisses on my lips brought a soothing calm that melted away my nerves, leaving me entranced by his thick manhood inside me. 
Soon, every ache I had felt was replaced by sweet moans of pleasure and waves of ecstasy... 
*** 
I woke up at nine in the morning, expecting to feel Bronn's warm, muscular body beside me, but my hand met only cool, empty sheets.  
Sitting up, I winced at the unfamiliar soreness between my thighs. Red stains on the white sheets reminded me of the previous night's events, flushing my cheeks with embarrassment. 
A folded note on the bedside table caught my attention.  
"I have to leave early for a business trip to New York. Please text Robert when you wake up. - Mr. Martin."  
The formal tone shocked me like a sudden splash of cold water. Where was the warmth, the intimacy we had just hours before? The harsh truth of our situation started to become clear. 
After freshening up, I messaged Robert. Bronn's executive assistant arrived promptly to escort me from the suite, his knowing look suggesting he was aware of what had transpired between his boss and me. The marks of our intimacy were likely evident on my skin. 
Silence hung heavily between me and Bronn's secretary as he drove me to Evelyn and my apartment door.  
Robert cleared his throat. "Miss Carter, the boss asked me to give this to you," he said, handing me a thick, cream-colored envelope. "And one more thing, I'll pick you up tonight. He wants you to stay at his villa." 
My mind raced with unanswered questions. Though no formal agreement had been made, it appeared that our relationship was progressing towards the terms outlined in the contract. 
Thankfully, Evelyn was out when I arrived home, sparing me her inevitable interrogation. Opening the envelope, I was taken aback. Inside were a check for two hundred thousand dollars, a black card, and a small packet of pills I recognized as emergency contraception. 
That's right! This was payment. For my virginity. For my body. For my compliance. 
Perhaps Bronn just wanted to fuck me.  
Swallowing my pride, I deposited the funds into the hospital's account, informing Dr. Vanderbilt that one hundred thousand was an advance payment under my mother's name. 
I couldn't forget the passion and gentleness Mr. Matin had shown me last night. How he'd looked at me, kissed me, touched me, made me feel  
It was then that I began to dream of being truly loved by Bronn Martin. 
But two years later, the revelation that he was about to marry another woman from his own social circle complicated everything...
###chapter 111: Mother's Shadow 
**Emily** 

Bronn's personality was always different whenever we were in bed. The way his dark blue eyes gazed at me, the way he showered my body with kisses, or the way he felt inside me-each moment was uniquely intense. 
Two years had slipped by almost unnoticed, like sand through an hourglass. 
My relationship with Bronn is hard to define. Despite lingering doubts, I often convince myself that our arrangement is normal.  
But I have no right to complain. This is in exchange for the hundred thousand dollars, a luxurious lifestyle, and the prestige of being Bronn Martin's chosen woman! 
Mr. Thompson, his butler, eyed me curiously while I was reviewing for my finals in the garden. 
"Is there a problem?" I asked. 
He cleared his throat. "Nothing to worry about, Miss Emily. Robert informed me that Mr. Martin will be away for another two days due to important business meetings." 
I nodded, trying to mask my disappointment with a shrug, accustomed as I was to Bronn often being away on business trips and not coming home. 
Evelyn, now living in Pennsylvania, once asked me why I always received messages from Bronn's people rather than directly from him. I had no satisfactory answer then, and I still don't.  
More often than not, it was Robert who relayed invitations for our dates or informed me of changes to Mr. Martin's schedule. I told myself that the latter was too busy to manage these details personally and that the butler was there to inform me of his whereabouts. 
A day passed, and I found myself missing Bronn, caressing the empty space on the bed beside me. 
Just as I was contemplating getting up, my phone rang. The caller ID displayed Dr. Vanderbilt's name.  
"Dr. Vanderbilt," I answered, "Is everything alright?" I asked. 
"Miss Carter, a relative came to visit your mother earlier today. I wasn't on duty then, so I didn't personally oversee the interaction. However, after the visitor left, your mother became extremely agitated. It seems she was informed about your father's passing two years ago." 
"I-I'm on my way, doctor," I stammered, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat.  
When Dad died, I had asked Dr. Vanderbilt how likely it was that my mom's health would be affected by the news of his death. He replied, "Given your mother's condition, it's very likely that it will have a severe impact. The emotional shock could exacerbate her heart disease significantly." 
My mother was Dad's mistress for years before I was born. Despite their eventual divorce, Dad committed to supporting her medical expenses when she developed heart disease. They had a formal agreement that also covered my education costs. 
My mother had gracefully accepted their separation terms. But I couldn't bring myself to tell her about Dad's death. The image of him found lifeless in his mansion, having suffered a heart attack while asleep and alone, haunted me. Knowing how deeply she still loved him, I feared what the news would do to her delicate health. 
As I hurried to the hospital in the luxury car Bronn had given me, guilt and fear battled inside me. I walked quickly down the familiar hallway to my mother's room. 
Dr. Vanderbilt and a nurse were with my mother when I entered the room. She was trembling, her face pale. Her eyes locked onto mine intensely when she saw me, making me flinch. 
"Why didn't you tell me, Emily? Why didn't you tell me that your father had been dead for a long time?!" Her chest heaved with the effort of speaking. 
"Mrs. Carter, please it would be best if you calm down," Dr. Vanderbilt urged. 
I started to cry and then, trying to stay calm, explained, "Mom, p-please This is exactly why I didn't tell you." 
But my mother's anger seemed to give her a newfound strength. "I feel like such a fool! You've been lying to me all this time, and I had to find out from Erica of all people!" 
My mother cried heavily, her breaths growing harder to take with each passing moment. Dr. Vanderbilt's efforts to soothe her appeared useless, and I felt panic welling up inside me. 
"Where did you get the money for my hospital expenses, Emily? Erica told me she was wondering why I was still here when she had stopped paying for it! Answer me!" 
Trembling in fear, tears streamed down my face as I tried desperately to calm her down.  
"Ahhhhh!" she screamed, despite her weakened state, managing to throw the medicine glass beside her at me. 
"Are you a mistress too, Emily? Is Erica right? Are you some man's... hidden woman? These hospital bills... millions... Where did the money come from?" Labored breaths punctuated her words, each one evidently causing her distress. 
"No, Mom! Please... You have to believe me..." My chest constricted, the sight of her struggling to breathe while directing all her anger at me almost unbearable. 
"Miss Carter, I need you to step out immediately!" Dr. Vanderbilt's urgent voice cut through the tension. 
Choking back sobs, I stumbled out of the room. In the hallway, I could hear Dr. Vanderbilt urgently calling for the emergency team. They rushed past me.  
Alone in the hallway, my sobs bounced off the empty walls. 
A mistress... 
Was I unknowingly repeating the same mistakes that had deeply hurt my mother? But Bronn, surely our situation was different. He cared for me, right? He was just helping with my financial troubles. 
Tears blurred my vision, and I trembled with fear. 
Several minutes passed before Dr. Vanderbilt emerged. The devastated look on his face told me everything. 
"Miss Carter..." he began gently. 
"What? Wh-what's happening, doctor?" 
He shook his head, his eyes full of sympathy. "I'm so sorry, but we couldn't save your mother." 
The world seemed to spin around me upon hearing those words, and I collapsed in tears in the hallway. Dr. Vanderbilt knelt beside me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. 
I never imagined losing my mother like this... 
The steady, haunting beep of the flat-lined heart monitor echoed through the silence. My mother lay there, her face now peaceful but still marked by our final, painful conversation. 
I approached her bed on unsteady feet, gently taking her hand in mine.  
"Mom..." I whispered, my voice breaking. "I'm so sorry... I never meant to hurt you. I love you so much." 
Hours were spent in the hallway, lost in indecision. Dr. Vanderbilt approached, asking, "How do you want to prepare the burial, Miss Carter?" 
At that moment, all I could manage was a weak, "As soon as possible..." 
As reality slowly seeped in, I felt an overwhelming need for support. With trembling hands, I typed a message to Bronn: 'Mr. Martin, can you please come home to the villa?' 
Bronn understood my mother was in the hospital, but I'd always kept that part of my life distant from him, afraid of complications. Living together in his villa, we fell into a routine, avoiding the complexities of our relationship. 
Now, in this darkest hour, I yearned for his presence, his strength. I needed an ally to face the storm of emotions threatening to overwhelm me. 
Minutes ticked by, and instead of Bronn, Robert replied: 'Miss Carter, Mr. Martin sends his apologies. He is unable to return tonight due to an urgent business trip to Dubai. He will be back in three days.' 
A sob escaped my lips, echoing in the empty corridor. Even now, in my time of crisis, our messages pass through someone as if I am pleading for a meeting in a cold business transaction. 
Feeling desperate, I sent another message: 'Please, Mr. Martin... I really need you. Can you please call me?' 
As I waited, the harsh reality of my choices sank in. I had chosen to enter this gilded cage, agreeing to wait quietly and lovingly for Bronn Martin, accepting whatever little attention he decided to spare. 
The call I so desperately needed never came, facing my grief alone.
###chapter 112: Glimpse of Reality 
**Emily** 

Evelyn's unwavering support has been invaluable during this challenging time, keeping me grounded as I cope with the immense grief of losing my mother. Despite feeling overwhelmed, I managed to organize my mother's burial surprisingly quickly. It's like a part of me is operating automatically, driven to finish these painful responsibilities. 
I feel Evelyn's curiosity about Bronn's noticeable absence, but she's chosen to be the supportive friend I need right now, setting aside her worries. 
Mr. Thompson sent a message asking where I was, showing his concern for me. Evelyn was the one who responded, saying I was in Los Angeles, lifeless in my grief.  
It took us two more days to finally hold my mother's wake, and Evelyn was with me throughout the entire ordeal. 
"Would you like to stay with me for now?" Evelyn asked as I took her to a hotel. 
I nodded. The idea of returning to the empty villa, with its echoing halls and memories, was unbearable. I needed company, and being alone at home would only make my grief worse. 
While lying in bed, Evelyn voiced what had been troubling her. "Where is Mr. Martin, Emily?" 
"On a business trip in Dubai," I murmured. 
"I hate to say this while you're so vulnerable, but I can't stay silent anymore, Emily. That man... he doesn't love you. You've been together for two years, and if he truly cared, he'd ensure you're okay, no matter what business trip he's on. Your well-being should be his priority." Evelyn's frustration spilled over. 
"Perhaps it's my fault. I didn't tell him that my mother died," I reasoned. "I asked him to call me because I couldn't convey such news through a message." 
"But he never called you..." Evelyn concluded firmly. 
I broke down, sobs wracking my body. "I don't know what to do, Eve," I choked between tears. "I rushed the burial as if I had no right to mourn, trying to avoid facing the reality of her loss. It feels like if I were to slow down, if I allowed myself to feel it truly, I might lose control!" 
"Oh, Emily," Evelyn murmured, pulling me close. "You're so brave. It's okay to let it out now." 
I cried in my friend's arms, releasing all the pain and confusion I had been holding inside. 
"I'm always here for you, you know that, right? Why don't you come with me to Lancaster?" she suggested. 
Evelyn's family has an apple and grape farm in Pennsylvania, 
"But my life is in Henderson, Eve..." 
 Despite Evelyn's likely assumption that I was focused on finishing my studies there, now that my mother is gone, I realize I must find a way to move forward. Many things are demanding my attention, including spending more time with Bronn Martin... 
I eventually fell asleep while Evelyn gently stroked my hair, her presence comforting me as we lay together in the hotel room she had rented. 
*** 
The following day, Emily woke me up to tell me she was heading back to Pennsylvania; her flight was scheduled soon. As I checked my phone, I saw a text from Robert informing me that Bronn's team was returning to Henderson. 
"Oh, my God!" Evelyn exclaimed, covering her mouth as we sat at the table, eating our breakfast. 
"Why?" I asked, curious about her sudden outburst. 
"Isn't this Mr. Martin?" she questioned, showing me her phone screen. Bronn's picture was on the left, next to a blurred image of an anonymous woman. The woman's photo showed only her neck adorned with a thick diamond necklace and a beautiful black satin gown. 
My eyes darted to the headline, each word feeling like a physical blow: 
'June 25th - Dubai, UAE - The prestigious families of Martin and Benner joyfully announce the upcoming wedding of their beloved heirs, Mr. Bronn Martin and Ms. Sarah Benner, an event captivating both high society and the media.' 
The announcement continued, detailing the upcoming wedding date and Sarah Benner's background, but the words blurred before my eyes. 
Deep down, I'd always known Bronn was destined for someone in his circle. It explained the nagging feeling that something was missing despite our closeness. But the pain... God, the pain was overwhelming. 
"Oh, God! Emily, it says here they've been engaged for two years! I mean..." Evelyn's voice trailed off, and I could see the questions swirling in her eyes, mirroring my own confusion and hurt. 
Tears streamed down my cheeks as the full impact of the situation hit me. The contract from two years ago came rushing back to me. I was to be Mr. Martin's mistress. I had known this truth despite my doubts over the past two years! 
"Emily... you deserve better than this," Evelyn said firmly. "I expect your call and tell me you're ending this madness with that guy! He's an asshole! He's cheating on his fiancée-with you?! He's messing with your head and deceiving whoever he's marrying!" 
Evelyn failed to grasp that the fault lay with me. It was I who had dreamed, I who had agreed to this life. Answers were what I needed then. A part of me clung to the belief that Bronn loves me somehow. 
I've seen it in his eyes-how he looked at me with adoration, his willingness to give me anything I asked for. There were times he'd cast aside work just to be with me. I know, I feel that I'm important to him, that he loves me! 
If he doesn't love me, I'll end this immediately.  
There would be no sense in continuing this relationship. I must find strength somehow, even though I'm not sure how. 
After dropping Evelyn off at the airport, I returned to the villa and noticed Bronn's car parked on the lawn.  
Wearing dark sunglasses to hide my red, swollen eyes from days of crying, I entered the villa and encountered Mr. Thompson in the foyer. 
"Emily, you're finally here!" 
I can't bring myself to respond. The weight of everything-my mother's death, Bronn's engagement-leaves me feeling hollow. 
"Mr. Martin is in your room. Please... his mood isn't good." 
Simply nodding, I made my way to the room. There, Bronn stood by the window, holding a glass of alcohol-an uncommon sight. The tension in the room was palpable. 
"I was informed you haven't been home for several nights. Have you forgotten our agreement? You are supposed to stay here even when I'm away!" he exclaimed. 
The audacity of this man!  
His words make me furious. After all that's happened, that's what he's worried about? I decide to get to the point directly, my voice trembling as I speak. 
"I want to know about this, Mr. Martin. Are you engaged to a woman named Sarah Benner-for two years? You didn't even tell me you would marry someone else." 
His voice thundered through the room, making me flinch. "You don't have the right to question me, Emily! I am paying you so that you'll stay by my side!" 
"I stayed with you because I love you!" I couldn't help but shout those words at him. The opulent bedroom of his villa suddenly felt suffocating. "I understand. Maybe you were just bored and looked for someone to pay to be in bed with. I know what you've spent on me-lavish gifts, designer clothes, this luxurious lifestyle-but my feelings are real!" 
"You can't, Emily! You shouldn't have done that!" he roared, running his hands through his perfectly blonde hair. "Can't you see I've drawn a line in our relationship? I am supposed to marry into the Benners! That's what I get for everything I do!" 
Tears streamed down my face uncontrollably; I couldn't stop. Maybe this is really my fault because I let myself be carried away by my desire to love him, to believe that what we had was more than a transaction. 
"But do you love me, Mr. Martin?" I asked weakly. 
He paused, locking eyes with me. His gaze contained so many emotions-conflict, desire, and perhaps a flicker of something softer.  
"This isn't love, Emily... we are bound by contract. You're my mistress, and you certainly don't have the right to question me when you're living the life everyone envies." 
"Then let's end this! I'm done, Mr. Martin!" I replied, summoning what little dignity I had left. 
"You can't, Emily!" he declared, a hint of panic creeping into his voice.  
"All I want to know is if you love me! Answer me!" 
Bronn's face hardened, a mask slipping into place.  
"Answer me, Mr. Martin!" 
"I'm paying you to play my lover. You know perfectly well your part in this messed up situation!" He threw his glass of alcohol against the wall and stormed out of the villa. 
Collapsed onto the plush carpet, my body was wracked with sobs, feeling the pain of what my life had become.  
I couldn't bear waiting by Bronn Martin's side any longer, longing for scraps of affection from someone who viewed me purely as a business deal. 
From that moment on, I made the painful decision to disappear from his life, convincing myself it was the right decision. 
Then, Willow was the most unexpected angel who came into my life.
###chapter 113: Unexpected Confidante 
**Sarah** 
"Are you sure you're going out?" Philip asked, taking the pair of diamond earrings from my hand. With careful precision, he fastened them to my ears. 
I had taken only one day off to recover from the exhaustion of Madam Cornell's abduction of Jane. The memory of those tense hours still sent a chill down my spine. 
"I don't want to just stay here in Serenity Pines," I replied, meeting Philip's worried gaze in the mirror. "I need to prove to my grandfather that I can handle what they left me." As I spoke, I unconsciously placed a hand on my slightly swollen abdomen, a reminder of the new life growing within me. 
After securing the earrings, Philip leaned in, placing a tender kiss on the curve of my shoulder. I felt him inhale deeply, savoring my scent. 
"That's precisely why I feel the need to push myself even harder," he murmured against my skin. "How's your family? What do they say about your pregnancy?" 
"I know I disappointed Grandpa Mitchell. He didn't expect me to get pregnant. Amir is still busy in Dubai, working on a new car model and other projects. But now that I'm pregnant, my grandfather is pestering Amir to get married next," I said, looking at him. "How about you? What did you and your dad talk about?" I asked casually. 
"I will resume work. Ethan forbade me from leaving Serenity Pines because the last round of tests showed some complications. He wants to keep a close eye on my recovery." 
A knot of worry formed in my stomach. "Has Mariano tried to contact you since you regained consciousness? 
"No, but Orlie did. I reached out to him after I regained my strength. I think Mariano has calmed down a bit. Don't worry about him. He won't hurt you. That's a promise." 
He kissed me on the lips before I said goodbye. If I stayed in Serenity Pines any longer, he definitely wouldn't let me leave. 
As I prepared to leave, I sent a quick message to my LoveLogic team: How's everyone doing? 
One by one, responses started coming in on my phone. 
Lexi: Busy as a bee! But the food here in Highland Hills is definitely to die for!  
Jakob: Swimming in Amir's pool! 
Those two were still enjoying their stay at Amir's villa, showing no signs of wanting to leave yet. I suspected a chemistry developing between them, but I decided it was best not to meddle. 
I went to Aspire Financial Group, eager to learn more. When I reached the executive floor where Emily and I shared an office, I found her completely absorbed in a stack of reports.  
I greeted her cheerfully, "Hello, dear!" 
Emily's head snapped up. "Sarah! It's nice to see you!" 
"I can tell you're very busy. I'm sorry," I said. Since I returned to Dubai, Emily has taken over much of my work. 
We immediately dove into discussing the work I had missed during my absence. 
Emily started explaining, "The jewelry brand where you hold a 5% share, its stock performance has been strong. According to the president, based on our last meeting, they plan to open another branch." Emily continued to share more updates, including several invitations from various brands addressed to me, which would enhance my credibility and reputation. 
During our conversation, Emily received a call from her child's nanny.  
"Hello? What?" Her voice suddenly filled with panic, her face paling. "Oh my God! I-I'm on my way!" 
"What happened?" I asked urgently after she ended the call. 
Emily's hands shook as she gathered her things. "My daughter was taken to the hospital because she ate something with peanuts. Luckily, her nanny noticed she was turning red and itchy. But when she started vomiting, the nanny panicked and called for emergency help." She looked at me, contemplating. "S-Sarah, I know we have important matters to discuss, but can I go to the hospital?" 
"Of course! I'll go with you!" I didn't hesitate to follow her to the hospital, understanding the gravity of the situation. 
We rushed to the hospital. When we arrived, a woman in her fifties, who I assumed was the nanny, approached us.  
"Emily, I'm really sorry... I got distracted by some mail that arrived, and I didn't notice that I hadn't put away the chips I had eaten earlier that contained peanuts. I was confident because I left Willow reading on the carpet and didn't see anything unusual. About twenty minutes later, I noticed her face swelling and turning red. Then, the vomiting started. I'm truly sorry..." 
Emily nodded tersely, her focus clearly on getting to her daughter.  
I followed Emily to the emergency area, where the doctor examined her child.  
"Willow!" Emily cried out. 
"Mommy..." Willow's voice was small and scared. She reached out for her mother, who quickly hugged her tightly. 
"Ms. Emily Carter?" an elderly doctor addressed Emily. 
"D-Dr. Vanderbilt!" Emily exclaimed. "I'm glad you're here, doctor. How is Willow?" 
The doctor smiled kindly. "It's good to see you again, Emily, though I wish it were under better circumstances." He began explaining Willow's condition, reassuring Emily as the little girl continued to cling to her. 
Dr. Vanderbilt? I think he's related to Ethan. 
The door swung open. To my surprise, Ethan himself walked in, his face etched with concern. 
"Sarah? I saw you enter the hospital and got worried that something might have happened to you, so I followed you." 
I scowled. "I bet you're just in the mood to tell my husband where I am again!" 
Ethan's gaze shifted, and he noticed Emily still in conversation with the older doctor. "Emily has a daughter?" he asked, surprise evident in his voice. 
I nodded and asked in return, "Is that man your dad?" 
"Yes." 
"He and Emily seem to know each other." I was also confused as to why Emily and the older doctor seemed familiar with each other. 
Once Dr. Vanderbilt finished his explanation, I politely asked Ethan to follow his father out. I didn't want Philip's presence to complicate matters at the moment. 
"Sorry about this, Sarah..." Emily's face showed genuine apology while still holding the little girl. 
"No, I should be apologizing," I insisted. "I think I might need to hire another assistant to share your workload." Given my pregnancy, I realized I needed to prepare for various scenarios. Emily didn't object, which suggested she welcomed the idea. 
Looking at the little girl's face, I couldn't help but ask about Bronn because it was undeniable that the child was his. Blonde hair, dark blue eyes... 
"Does... does Bronn know about her?" 
Emily shook her head, a visible shiver running through her body. It was clear that discussing Bronn and their child was a sensitive topic. 
I didn't want to meddle in that matter, so I stayed quiet. 
"Please, Sarah... Please don't tell Bronn," she pleaded, tears welling in her eyes. 
I reached out, grasping her hand supportively. 
"He might sue me, Sarah That's the most frightening thing of all. It's ironic that out of everyone I could tell this to-it's you." I could see the pain in her eyes. "Since you already have an idea about me, I'll tell you not to ruin Bronn's image for you our contract explicitly stated that I couldn't get pregnant. That was the life I agreed to back then, and I'm still bound by it now." 
She's right! This situation was indeed complicated. 
If that's the case, how did Willow come into her life? 
On one hand, I felt sympathy for Emily and the fear she must live with daily. From what I know of Bronn, he would definitely follow the contract.
###chapter 114: Mr. Perfect’s Broken Lover 
**Sarah** 

Emily was busy with her daughter, so I had no choice but to attend some gatherings that required my presence; they were important events for keeping my social and business connections strong. 
Philip returned to the Luminary Production's office to handle pressing issues, and everything seems to be going well, except for Jane, who is still on vacation. 
As I was leaving Serenity Pines, I chose Josh to accompany me to the Elite Annual Business Gala. I hadn't spoken to him for quite some time because Philip had been keeping an eye on me at the villa. 
The truth is, Josh and I have nothing to hide, but I feel like a wife keeping a secret with her lover. Josh's life is complicated, and it's not my place to disclose his background to everyone. 
"I heard that Jane is still in recovery," Josh started, his eyes fixed on the winding road ahead, hands steady on the steering wheel, driving me to a hotel in a nearby town. 
"Yeah she enrolled in therapy and counseling. I hope everything works out for her," I replied. 
"How about you? Are you okay? If you don't mind me saying, you also need counseling." Josh's eyes flicked to me momentarily 
"That's precisely why you're here, Josh. I don't feel comfortable opening up to just anyone. I am feeling better now, especially since I am pregnant. I am determined that my pregnancy should not go public," I said. 
As we approached the hotel, it became clear this was no ordinary gathering. A line of sleek, expensive cars snaked towards the entrance, suggesting a star-studded event was taking place. It took a few minutes before I got out. I handed over the invitation while Josh quietly followed me. 
Just stepping into the grand foyer, Philip's call came through. I wasn't planning to answer, but I knew I needed to reassure him of my whereabouts. 
"Hello?" 
Philip's voice came through, a mix of irritation and what I could only describe as jealousy. "You are with Josh? I left that guy at Serenity Pines because I couldn't stand seeing him, but it seems I made a miscalculation." 
"Philip, you are annoying! Why are you picking on a bodyguard? Josh is excelling at his job, and you should be grateful that I have someone reliable watching over me." 
His following words left me momentarily speechless. "What if our baby ends up bearing a resemblance to Josh because you two are always together?" 
Here we go again. "Philip, you know, if the baby looks like someone else, it's because the mother must have cheated." 
"So, you mean you cheated?" 
How had I suddenly become the villain in this scenario? My baby's form isn't even fully developed yet. This brute! I don't have time for him, seriously! 
"You're giving me a headache! I'm ending this call, Philip! Hmp!" 
I shook my head as I hung up. I saw some acquaintances at the event and mingled with them. After a while, Bronn arrived and kissed me on the cheek. 
"Hey! I never thought you'd be here!" I remarked. 
"I could say the same. I thought you mentioned staying at Amir's villa?" 
He must have expected to see Emily at the gathering if that's the case. Bronn introduced me to some influential people who were surprised to learn that I was Grandpa Mitchell's granddaughter. 
We stayed at the gathering for a while before Bronn gathered the courage to invite me to the garden area to talk privately. He cleared his throat before seriously sharing what was on his mind. 
"Where where is Emily?" 
We both had our own curiosities. I felt torn between my loyalty to Emily and my curiosity about Bronn's perspective. Why did he allow her to leave? I could understand why Emily might have walked away; I'll do the same. 
"There's been... a complication in her home," I said carefully 
He frowned. "What do you mean, a complication? Her mother passed away, didn't she? Does Emily have other relatives I don't know about?" 
Bronn had met Emily's mother. My assistant hadn't mentioned that to me; I only knew about Willow. I wouldn't tell Bronn about the child. It wasn't my place to reveal such personal information. 
"Bronn, our engagement didn't happen. I mean, the planned wedding Why did you let Emily leave?" 
His jaw tightened. 
"Because she fell in love with me, Sarah" he admitted, his voice thick with anguish. He quickly drank his scotch in one go as if trying to erase the painful memory. 
I heard from Emily that her relationship with Bronn was contractual. Still, it saddened me to think these two people loved each other yet couldn't be together. But it wasn't my place to play matchmaker or confidante to them both. 
Bronn continued, "I couldn't give her the love she deserved, Sarah. You know the expectations our families have... Emily was just a young and innocent student back then. Our social circle would have torn her apart-everyone knew I was supposed to marry you. But when you married Philip, Emily disappeared too" 
"Did you try to find her?" I asked, my curiosity piqued. 
"I did. That's when I discovered her mother had passed away while I was in Dubai..."  
My shoulders slumped at the news. For a while now, I had been contemplating the similarities between Emily and myself. We had both left the men we loved to pursue our paths. 
"What do you want now, Bronn?" I asked, my curiosity tinged with accusation. "Do you want Emily?" 
His piercing blue eyes darted away from mine, refusing to meet my gaze. "She's not for me, Sarah..." 
I held back a sigh and decided to disregard his apparent avoidance. It was his life and his decision, no matter how misguided it seemed. 
As Bronn and I returned to the gathering, my attention was caught by two women being interviewed-the mistress of my father and her daughter, Lila. 
"Miss Sarah Benner, it's been some time since you were last seen in public. As the sole princess of the Benners, what are your plans now that we'll see more of you in various high-profile activities?" the eager reporter inquired. 
Margarette, her mother, responded, "She's managing some significant business responsibilities and has received invitations from several prestigious brands. She will certainly be sharing some of Amir Benner's burdens in the company, preparing for her future role." 
Lila followed her mother's lead, saying, "Yes, I'm also involved in designing the new line of vehicles at TerraTraxx Automotive. I'm excited about my first appearance at the Elite Annual Business Gala and the invitations I've received. It's truly heartwarming not to be forgotten by the industry, and I'll gladly accept these opportunities to contribute to our family's legacy." 
"What's happening, Sarah?" Bronn turned to me. Among all the socialites and personalities here, he was the only one who knew the truth-that I was the real Sarah Benner. 
"I don't know, Bronn. But one thing's certain-those conniving mother and daughter are using my name!" 
My expression darkened as I observed them. Margarette seemed to sense someone watching them. Her eyes widened when she saw me, surprised because I hadn't attended such gatherings in years.  
Then, as if on cue, Lila noticed me too. Her perfectly plucked eyebrows rose, and unease flickered across her features. 
I allowed a cold, calculating smirk to play across my lips, subtly warning them.  
Whatever game this ambitious mother-daughter duo was playing, it was clear I needed to confront Dad. He owed me an explanation for this deception-why he allowed them to take my identity as Sarah Benner.
###chapter 115: To the Doghouse 
**Sarah** 

As the mother and daughter vanished from the reporters' sight, they turned their attention to me, coming closer with a blend of surprise and barely concealed hostility. 
"Mr. Martin!" Lila's eyes held admiration as she recognized my ex-fiancé standing beside me. I arched an eyebrow, seeing her reddened cheeks.  
"What are you doing here?" Margarette, my dad's new wife, asked with a hint of panic in her voice, glancing at Bronn. 
Bronn's presence at the gathering wasn't surprising given his reputation. What really surprised them was my unexpected appearance beside him. 
I allowed a smirk to play on my lips. "Surprised to see the real Sarah Benner in this gathering?" 
Lila's anger twisted her face, her composed façade crumbling. "Ha! You're just being funny! It's your fault for hiding away! You should be thanking me for keeping your name relevant!" 
This woman is beyond being ridiculous. I could easily dismiss them as being brainless. I ignored Lila's outburst, focusing my attention on Margarette. Her eyes darted nervously, avoiding my gaze.  
"Margarette, does my dad know about this?" I asked, ensuring Amir's father was aware of their impersonation of me as the Benners' only daughter. 
Lila interjected again. "Of course he does! Your dad loves me. He'll understand why I had to do this, especially against you!" 
Keeping my composure, I pressed further. "Where is he?" 
Lila narrowed her eyes, her words filled with venom. "My dad doesn't love you anymore! I'm the one living in the Benner mansion now. All his affection belongs to me! Stop acting like a bitch and-" 
My palm struck her delicate face. I couldn't hold back. Gasps echoed from the onlookers around us who didn't know what was happening. 
The deep betrayal of the affection I had bestowed upon the dad I once cared for, despite him not being my biological parent, weighed heavily on me. Was it not natural for him to care about me? Yet, he had embraced these women into his life! 
"You bitch!" Lila shrieked, attempting to slap me, but Josh's firm grip caught her arm, restraining her. He pushed her back, his face a mask of disgust. Bronn stepped protectively in front of me. 
"Stop it, both of you!" Margarette whispered urgently, her eyes darting to the growing crowd of onlookers. 
Curious onlookers gathered nearby, discreetly filming the unfolding drama with their smartphones. 
I stood tall, casting my gaze downward upon these women. "Dear, here is some advice if you plan to impersonate me: Sarah Benner never forgets her manners. You'd fail right there!" 
Lila's lips tightened, a flicker of uncertainty crossing her face.  
Without waiting for their response, I walked away from the mother and daughter, concealing my irritation. 
After we moved away where no one could hear us, Bronn walked beside me, speaking quietly and with concern. "Are you really going to let them use your name like that?" 
"Let them enjoy their moment. It's not wise to retaliate immediately. I need more evidence. Did she mention numerous partnership agreements with her from famous brands? That woman will find herself entangled in legal consequences she never anticipated." 
Putting the mother-daughter incident aside, I changed the subject to, "Anyway, Bronn's official launch on the LoveLogic app is next week. Be prepared; your fanbase will definitely grow." 
"Tell that to yourself when Philip's character makes his debut," Bronn grinned. 
The mention of Philip made my stomach flutter unexpectedly, but I brushed it aside. Fatigue was sinking in, so I chose to end the evening early. 
In the back of my chauffeured car, I checked my phone. As usual, Philip flooded my phone with messages. This annoying guy! 
Ignoring his texts, I quickly messaged Amir: 'Lila and Margarette are impersonating me in public. Where's Dad? We need to address this.' 
After a moment, I sent him another message: 'I need another assistant to help Emily. Please begin the search.' 
Emily messaged me, too: 'Hi Sarah! I'm relieved to report that my daughter is completely over her allergy now. I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience. I can return to work tomorrow.' 
I couldn't deny Emily's unwavering dedication. 
The dashboard clock indicated well past one in the morning as we arrived at Serenity Pines Estate. The imposing gates opened silently, and moments later, we came to a smooth stop in front of the building. 
"Thank you," I told Josh as he opened the car door. 
"Please take care of yourself," Josh replied, filled with genuine concern. "Let me know if you experience panic disorder again." 
I smiled gratefully at Josh; he was an invaluable member of my team. Sensing someone's gaze, I glanced up at the building and saw Philip leaning against the railing, dressed in a gleaming white robe that shimmered in the moonlight.  
His intense gaze was fixed directly on Josh and me, unreadable yet compelling. 
*** 
**Philip**  
From the balcony, Sarah was visible. I felt a surge of annoyance and jealousy seeing how beautifully she responded to Josh, like a smiling sunflower. I haven't figured out how to shake off these bad feelings yet; it's as if they share some understanding that eludes me. 
When Sarah glanced up, guilt flickered in her eyes. What could she possibly feel guilty about? My irritation deepened at the sight. 
I shed my clothes and sat at the edge of the bed, leaving the balcony open to our bedroom. 
Jerking and holding my thick shaft, my anticipation built as I listened to the faint sounds of her footsteps approaching our room. Each moment felt like an eternity until finally, with a gentle creak, the door swung open, and she entered. 
"Philip, why are you-" 
She couldn't finish what she was saying and just swallowed while looking in my direction. 
I smirked, noticing how she reacted. 
Standing up, I approached Sarah. A gentle caress of my hand on her neck preceded a tender kiss. She gasped and then looked at me with a pleading expression. 
"I will punish you for your disobedience," I whispered before pressing my lips against hers. 
Unzipping her elegant dress intensified my desire. I lifted her up. "Ahh!" she shrieked in surprise. 
"Are you sure you're ready for this?" she asked, concerning about my health. 
"You should be asking yourself that, babe, if you can handle what I have planned for you." 
Seating her on the couch near the balcony, my intention is clear: I want everyone in Serenity Pines, especially that bastard Josh, to understand that Sarah belongs to me! There are things I can do with my wife that he can never match! 
Standing up, I jerked my hardness with my right hand while looking at Sarah, who was gulping.  
"Go on I know you were missing him!" I murmured. The mere sight of my cock near her provocative expression compelled me to take her right then and there. 
She held my shaft, and god, how good it felt; her warm mouth, her saliva, and her tongue-rolling over my sensitive skin-in and out  
"Fuuuuuck!" I open my mouth wide. Still, my heart overflowed with adoration for this woman. I couldn't believe I was the man who had captured her heart and no one else. 
"Damn it!" I tightened my grip on her hair as I ejaculated into her mouth. 
I pressed my lips to hers with passion, letting my tongue tease its way down to her chest and nipple. I gave her all the time she needed to drown in ecstasy.  
"Philip I need it now!" she pleaded after some time.  
They say pregnant women can be particularly needy, with libidos that exceed all expectations. "Yes, babe. I'll take care of you soon..."  
Lies! I've already stated that I will discipline this disobedient pregnant woman. 
I kissed her pussy passionately until she couldn't hold back. "God!" Her cries, pleas, and moans echoed unmistakably throughout the villa. 
"Philip, please I need it" She bit her lip, swallowing hard at the sight of my cock.  
I gently traced the length of her slimy wetness with my hard shaft, teasing her by inserting only the tip. She trembled, desire evident as she yearned for me to take her completely.  
"Please, Philip. I want it!" she pleaded.  
"Will you continue to be a compliant wife from now on?" I asked, pinching her hard nipple with my fingers.  
My hands, cock, and mouth tormented her, and she seemed to have realized that I had no intention of claiming her.  
"Philip"  
Soon, she cried... my Sarah cried, and I panicked. She looked at me with resentment and kicked me off the couch.  
"Get out! Get out of my room!" she bellowed, tears streaming down her cheeks. 
Wait a moment! The residents of Serenity Pines Estate must have caught on that I was headed straight for the doghouse-after all, that was my intention from the start-to make them hear us! 
"Philip, I swear you're going to stress out my baby! Get ooooout!" 
I don't know how to explain. My pregnant wife isn't playing with me anymore. Before I could formulate a response, she advanced on me.  
With surprising strength for someone in her condition, Sarah pushed against my bare chest. I staggered back, feeling the cool hallway air on my skin as she unceremoniously shoved me out of our bedroom. 
"Sarah, I'm-" She slammed the bedroom door shut in my face. 
I knocked on the door. "Babe yoo-hoo... Please let me in I-I'm naked!" 
Silence greeted me from the other side of the door. My pregnant wife remained unmoved. She didn't care. 
Looking down at my shaft. "This is all your fault!"
###chapter 116: Beyond Blood 
**Sarah** 

Exasperated with Philip, I asked him to leave the room. Once alone, I tried to calm myself, still frustrated by his behavior. That annoying and utter jerk! Tss! 
Exhaustion took over, replacing my anger. I quickly cleaned up and took a brief bath. Finally, I collapsed onto the bed, letting sleep take over and wash away the night's turmoil. 
Sunlight filtered through the curtains as I stirred the next morning.  
Reading my unread messages, I found messages from Amir and, unexpectedly, my father-the illustrious Chairman Benner. As I made my way downstairs, I chose to address Amir's message first.  
Amir: Margarette might have questioned why you're not flaunting your social status. After living in Benner's mansion for years, people might even mistake Lila for Dad's daughter. They had the nerve to use your name! 
I replied: I'm not afraid of them. In fact, I plan to let them enjoy using my name for now. Let them feel the overwhelming attention of the public and influential figures, thinking I couldn't do anything about it and helpless. Lila must be over the moon, drunk on the name and the fame she believes is coming her way. 
In the kitchen, I saw Philip preparing his coffee.  
"Babe," he said, his voice a mix of concern and wariness, "how are you feeling?" 
I briskly walked past him and methodically prepared my milk, feigning absorption in my phone to evade his pleading gaze. 
His brow furrowed, lines etching deeper as realization dawned. "Babe, is this about last night? I'm really sorry... I didn't mean to-" 
After making the warm milk, I walked emotionlessly to the spacious living room of Serenity Pines Estate. 
"Sarah!" Philip's voice carried a note of frustration as he trailed after me. 
Just then, Alex appeared in the doorway, his tablet clutched to his chest. 
"Hi, Alex!" I greeted warmly, "Why are you early today?"  
"Good morning, Madam Sarah! I hope you're well. I heard you attended the event last night," Alex replied. 
I relaxed on a plush couch, feeling the tension in my shoulders ease a bit as I leaned back. From my peripheral vision, I noticed Philip looking sour.  
"Sarah, are you seriously ignoring me? You greet my assistant before acknowledging me?" 
Sipping my hot milk, I continued to disregard Philip's presence. 
Alex cleared his throat. "I came because you were in the news, ma'am. Some individuals took pictures of you last night alleging you confronted Ms. Sarah Benner." 
"What happened last night?" Philip inquired, his curiosity palpable as he settled into the seat beside me. 
I turned to Alex and said firmly but quietly, "Alex, please inform your boss that I'll handle this situation personally." 
"Uh..." Alex hesitated, his hand rising to scratch his cheek nervously. His eyes darted between Philip and me, a somber expression settling on his face. 
Philip leaned forward, his voice taking on a pleading tone. "Babe, if this is about last night... I'm truly sorry. I never meant to-" 
But I wasn't in the mood for his apologies. My irritation towards him had grown lately, and I couldn't pinpoint why. Perhaps it's the hormones of a pregnant woman? Geez! 
"Alex, kindly let your boss know that he's currently testing my patience. It would be better if he stayed at the company rather than adding to my stress levels." 
I turned to my phone and opened the message from my father, waiting for me to read it. 
Chairman Benner: I thought you were disappearing from my life. Meet me in the afternoon at The Grand Hotel. 
Staring at the message, my grip on the phone tightened involuntarily. Philip noticed the shift in my demeanor, the darkening of my expression as I held the device. 
"What is it, babe?" he asked, concern evident in his voice. 
"Alex-" I began, glancing up to where the assistant had been standing, only to find the space empty. Philip must have sent him away, likely to eliminate the middleman I'd been using to communicate earlier. 
My hands trembled as I rubbed my temples, trying to hold back tears threatening to spill. 
"Babe, talk to me. What's going on?" Philip's voice was gentle, his hand reaching out to envelop mine. 
With a deep breath, I knew I had to tell Philip the truth. He needed to understand my plan. 
"Lila has started using my name, Sarah Benner, at public events. She's my dad's illegitimate child with Margarette-his mistress who became his wife. They don't share a biological relationship since Lila's from another man. Lila and her mother have been living in the mansion for a while now, and I'm unsure if they know my history with Marcus." 
"You mean she's openly using your name in public?" Philip asked incredulously. 
"Yes. Philip, there's a high chance they'll tarnish my name as Sarah Benner, which scares me. I must closely watch them, monitor their every move to protect myself." 
"Come here," Philip murmured, gently urging me onto his lap. 
The couches were positioned side by side, a silent invitation for closeness. At this moment, I craved nothing more than unwavering support. Rejection had become a familiar sting, but nothing compared to the strain with my dad.  
Right now, I craved support, especially from Philip. Feeling his touch on my back comforted me as I nestled against him, seeking solace like a cat. 
"I'll go with you to ensure you're safe," he assured me gently. 
The dam burst. I buried my face in Philip's neck, tears flowing uncontrollably. His shirt absorbed my sobs, releasing years of pent-up hurt and confusion. 
"Shh..." Philip soothed me, his hand moving in slow circles on my back. "Everything will be alright, babe. I promise you that." 
"I just... I don't understand why he abruptly ended our relationship," I confessed. 
Philip kissed my forehead tenderly. "Considering your dad's situation, I understand his perspective. Finding out his wife had a child with someone else must have been deeply painful, especially if Chairman Benner truly loved your mom..." 
I absorbed Philip's words, finding a measure of peace in his understanding. Moments passed with gentle forehead kisses and his comforting hand on my back. 
After composing myself, I urgently messaged Jakob, needing him at Serenity Pines immediately. 
"I'm sorry about last night..." Philip began softly. "But... could you please limit your interactions with Josh? I can't help but feel uneasy when I see you with that bodyguard." A frown creased his brow. 
"You don't need to worry about Josh," I assured him. "He's saved my life multiple times, so my trust in him runs deep. He's been instrumental in helping me manage my panic disorder." 
I hoped Philip understood the depth of my feelings for him. Surely, by now, he must know that he holds my heart completely. 
A cough interrupted us. I glanced over to see Trey blushing as he spoke. "Boss, Jakob is on his way to the villa." 
Reluctantly, I shifted back to my own seat.  
Philip stood, asking me, "What would you like to eat?" 
"Anything is fine," I replied, managing a smile. 
Before Philip could leave, Jakob's cheerful voice rang out from the doorway.  
"Hello, friends!" he continued with a mischievous glint. "Seriously, you two! I know Philip's long recovery has left you both dry. But do you realize what people are gossiping about at the gate? They're speculating about all sorts of kinky escapades!" 
My jaw dropped, and I turned to Philip, who suddenly looked very guilty. 
This rascal! 
"I'll get started on the food," Philip said hastily, making his exit. 
"Philip, you brute!" 
*** 
My heart raced as Philip and I approached the hotel suite, with Trey shadowing us for security.  
Despite Chairman Benner's presence, I knew the actual threat lay with my biological father, Marcus, whose unstable state posed a far greater danger.  
Stepping into the suite, a wave of tension gripped my chest at the sight of the man I once considered as a father. The last time we met was at Amir's wedding. 
Gathering my composure, I confronted him directly.  
"Do you know about your wife and daughter's plan for stealing my identity as Sarah Benner?"
###chapter 117: Daughter's Dilemma 
**Sarah**  
Earnestly staring at the man I had been considered a father for several years, he sat on the couch, meeting my gaze without emotion.  
"Is it true that you insulted Lila and Margarette last night? Your name-Sarah Benner-is plastered across every social media platform and gossip blog in the country because of your little outburst." Dad paused, then looked at his assistant, who continued.  
"Miss, this social blog claims you bullied Sarah Benner, who was actually Miss Lila pretending to be you. Of course, no one knew you were the real Sarah Benner, but people say Benner managed to let it go."  
Of course, why would someone let slap Sarah Benner? But why does it seem like it's my fault?  
"You are tarnishing your own name! No, my name! How am I supposed to explain to people that there's nothing to worry about?"  
I understood what my father was getting at.  
"They're using my identity!" I interjected, my voice rising with each word. "She's parading around as Sarah Benner!"  
Philip's and my father's faces darkened. I saw Philip clench his fists and grind his teeth, but he held back, fearing being called useless. I was sure the blame would fall on me.  
"You shouldn't have confronted Lila publicly!" he roared. "Sarah, you've had every advantage-the best schools, the finest tutors, and years of etiquette training! You've been under the Benner roof, enjoying our protection and privilege. Surely, you know better than anyone how to handle sticky situations with grace and tact!"  
My lips pressed together. I felt hurt as I looked at him. Gathering all my courage, I replied, "I did think properly; I did exactly what you taught me to do! You taught me never to let anyone disrespect or use me! Well, your new wife is using my name, my identity!"  
A harsh laugh escaped my father's lips. "Why does it matter now? Because suddenly the perks of being a Benner are important to you? Now that someone else is playing the role you neglected, it seems like you've awakened to reality!"  
"It wasn't like that!" I trembled with anger. "I am the real Sarah Benner! My name is important to me!"  
"Don't make me laugh! That is the truth, deep inside! You threw away your name for years! Remember that you are borrowing your name from me-Benner! You're just like your mother-nothing but an opportunistic user!"  
Trembling with rage, my father's words about my mother felt like poison on his lips, thickening the air in the room with suffocating tension.  
Philip couldn't take it anymore. "You have no right to insult my wife, especially since you have no relation to each other!"  
Tightening my grip on Philip's arm, I sought to calm him down while giving him a quiet warning glance.  
Dad's eyes narrowed to slits, his gaze shifting between Philip and me.  
"So, it's true. You married the president of Luminary Productions!" He let out a bitter chuckle; his disgust for Philip was evident in every line of his face. "I also heard you're already divorced... at twenty-one? You're proving that your actions show you lack judgment and direction! All you do is run! You keep doing things that Sarah Benner shouldn't do!"  
Tears streamed down my face.  
"I ran away so that you and Amir wouldn't be hurt! Yes, I admit I used Philip's marital status! But what choice did I have? My mother had just died, and you blamed me for everything! At seventeen, I had to analyze, plan, and prepare everything alone for my life! You rejected me! And even now... even now, you despise me because I'm another man's child!"  
My chest tightened painfully as the memories flooded back.  
"It's not my fault my mom was kidnapped! It's not my fault I'm someone else's child!" I said through gritted teeth as I reopened wounds that had never truly healed.  
"Even if you don't say it outright, I know you blame me because you can't direct your anger at my mom! I was left behind, her perfect resemblance! That's why you're so angry with me!"  
"Get. Out!" Dad's voice was dark and dangerous. His face darkened as he turned away, facing the window-a clear sign that he was ending our conversation.  
I knew he hated being reminded of the past, which was why he kept his distance from me-an undeniable proof that my mother had a child with another man.  
"Dad, are you really cutting me out of your life?" I asked, desperately seeking answers so I could move on.  
He didn't answer. He remained facing away. Philip held my hand, sensing I was about to collapse.  
"I won't forget that this is the second time you've pushed me out of your life! And this is also the second time I'll declare my love for you despite everything."  
He glanced at me with indifference.  
"I am Sarah Benner! That is my identity! If you want to treat Lila like a daughter, do it properly! You weren't even sure if that mother and daughter could be trusted! You know that about yourself! Now, I'll have to apologize if they get hurt in the process. I'm not backing down!"  
His assistant trembled. "Miss, it's better if you leave"  
Unable to hold back my tears, I left the suite and sobbed in Philip's arms.  
Philip's expression darkened, his jaw clenching as he held me. The intensity of my emotions overwhelmed me until I struggled to breathe.  
"Philip!" I held onto his arm tightly, fingers gripping his sleeve as I struggled to breathe. Panic surged in my chest, making it even harder to get air. "Philip, p-please, t-take me to Josh!"  
In the grip of overwhelming emotions, I had forgotten about my pregnancy and the need to be cautious. The intensity of it all-the confrontation, the rejection, the fear-caused me to lose consciousness.  
"S-Sarah!" I heard Philip's voice as darkness enveloped me. "Damn it!"  
When I woke up, I found myself in the hospital ward, unsure of how much time had passed.  
Silently, I stared at the ceiling, tracing the patterns in the acoustic tiles while attempting to piece together what had happened.  
"Babe" Philip kissed my hand, visibly shaken by anger, fear... or something else. I couldn't tell. Suddenly, I wondered if this had anything to do with my pregnancy.  
"Tell me the baby is okay..." I whispered, my free hand moving instinctively to my stomach.  
"You and the baby are healthy," he assured me, squeezing my hand gently. "I'm restricting your activities, Sarah, and that's final. It's for your own good."  
I nodded, knowing Philip was right. But little did I realize then that Philip had unresolved feelings about Josh.  
***  
**Philip**  
As I reflect on Sarah's relationship with Josh, a heavy stone weighs on my chest.  
At first, Sarah begged me not to let Josh get suspended, revealing a deep connection I hadn't noticed. It stung even more knowing Josh had supported Sarah through panic attacks-attacks I had triggered.  
During my coma, Josh was by Sarah's side, helping her find me. When Sarah fainted upon meeting her dad, her first words were, "Philip, p-please, t-take me to Josh!"  
Struggling to decipher my emotions, I wondered if it was just jealousy or something more profound, tightening my fist.  
Maybe Sarah didn't realize yet how much she was hurting me.  
So, this is what heartache felt like  
Yet, I had no right to demand anything, not after what I'd done to her.  
Suppressing my feelings, I declared, "I'll ensure those who hurt you suffer, my love that's a promise!"  
Four months later, the news of Sarah and I expecting twins filled me with joy-until a video broke the internet, showing Sarah engaged in a sexual act with Josh
###chapter 118: Marrying into Wealth 
**Sarah** 

***\[A week after my conversation with Dad.\]*** 
Philip had asked me to limit my outings outside Serenity Pines Estate, citing concerns for my safety and well-being. I agreed to his suggestion, understanding his protective instincts, but I had some important business engagements to attend too.  
Fortunately, my pregnancy wasn't showing yet, allowing me to seamlessly manage the big event for LoveLogic. 
Emily and I sat at the very edge of the large event hall, where the event was broadcast live on our social media platform, which the BM Technologies marketing team still manages. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to meet our newest VIP character!" the charismatic host announces, her voice echoing through the hall. "We proudly introduce... Bronn!" 
The main screen lights up, revealing an animated non-player character clearly inspired by Bronn Martin, the young head chief of BM Technologies.  
The host, smiling excitedly, started listing Bronn's features.  
"And the best part? When you update your LoveLogic app, you'll find Bronn waiting as your very own non-player character companion!" 
I turned to Emily. "How does it feel to see a non-realistic version of Bronn like this?" Realizing my question might have been insensitive, I quickly backtracked. "I'm sorry, that just slipped out. Think of it as just a casual survey." 
She shrugged, saying, "It's cringe-worthy in some ways, yet I can't help but be amazed by the technology and creativity behind it." 
I can't suppress a small giggle at her response. Changing the subject, I lean in closer. "Oh, by the way, I wanted to tell you-my brother has found two new assistants for me. This means your workload will be much lighter and shared with the team." 
"Wow! That's great! By the way, Sarah, perhaps you haven't realized it, but people recognize you more, especially at the office. The value of the stocks we recently invested in is skyrocketing! At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if you become a recognized name in the business world within a year or two, purely based on your rapidly growing net worth," Emily explained. 
Hmmm, perhaps I can build my own empire in the future. 
Jakob approached us with a broad smile, showing me the live status of our app. "We received great feedback, Sarah! People are absolutely loving our app!" he said excitedly. "Just today alone, we've had over a hundred thousand new downloads. It's exploding!" 
"That's great, Jakob!" Caught up in the moment, I stand and throw my arms around him in a celebratory hug. However, it was brief as someone pulled him away by the collar. 
Then I saw Philip behind Jakob, looking sour. He came closer and hugged me.  
"Philip!" I greet him, genuinely happy to see him.  
He kissed me on the cheek. "Congratulations, love!" he murmured. 
"Wow! I just wanted to hug my friend!" Jakob said with a pout. 
My husband ignored Jakob's comment and focused only on me. "I heard you've been busy with this event since this morning. Let's go home and get some rest." 
Thanks to Philip's concern for me, he even took the trouble to pick me up.  
As we cruised along the city streets, I couldn't help but ask about Jane.  
"Jane mentioned that your dad called her back to Luminary Productions to head the advertising team. Because of that, she had to turn down our offer to work on new character designs," I said, enjoying the buns Philip had bought for me. 
Although I stay in touch with Jane through texts, we last met in person when we visited their mansion. 
"Don't worry about her. Jane's doing great," he assured me, a gentle smile playing at the corners of his mouth.  
"Oh, I know; it's just that I miss her so much!" I pouted my lips.  
He let me finish my bun in contemplative silence as we continued our journey home. 
The following day, Jakob asked me to visit Amir's villa, conveniently located across from Serenity Pines, where he's currently staying. I allowed him his fondness for the place. Philip had left early for work, including a visit to a construction site. I noticed he had doubled his workload, likely pressured due to my pregnancy. 
"I have good news!" Jakob announced, munching on an apple while facing his laptop. 
"What is it?" 
"A total of half a million users have downloaded our Lovelogic app, baby!" Jakob exclaimed. 
I squealed in excitement. "That's amazing news, Jakob!" 
"Yes! And that's not all." He grabbed his sleek iPad, placed it in front of me, and showed its high-resolution screen filled with colorful charts and graphs-detailed analytics of the LoveLogic app. 
"We have thousands of users who have made Bronn their non-realistic boyfriend in the app. They don't mind paying a premium to purchase Bronn's character-it's become our most popular option by far." 
However, Jakob wasn't finished. "What really caught my attention," he said, his brow furrowing slightly, "is that Sarah Benner-or should I say, Lila-the one you asked me to keep an eye on? She purchased Bronn's character too." 
"I'm not bothered by that," was all I could say. 
"I did some digging, and I think Lila might be obsessed with my brother Bronn," Jakob explained. 
I considered this for a moment, thinking back to my own observations. "I'm not entirely surprised by that. When I was with Bronn at the party, I noticed that Lila looked at him with admiration." 
"I heard from my mom that your dad talked to my parents. It's only now that I realized what it was about. Initially, I thought they talked because of you. This morning, I asked my mom if the agenda for the meeting was about the engagement between our families, and she confirmed it. However, she said it's not about you and Bronn. The Benners replaced you, and they want Lila to marry my brother instead." 
My eyes rolled at this revelation. 
"And what did Bronn say about it?" I asked. 
"I'm not sure! My parents were eager for him to get married." 
A thought struck me, and I furrowed my brow. "You know he has a daughter with Emily, right?" 
"Honestly, I'm itching to ask Bronn about it! Geez! But I know if I do, you'll end our friendship! Sometimes it's hard knowing too much!" Jakob complained. 
"How about your parents? Would they approve of Emily for Bronn, given the circumstances?" 
"I don't know... My parents have high expectations for Brother Bronn, especially since he's the head chief at BM Technologies." 
"And at this point," I pressed, feeling a knot forming in my stomach, "your parents likely to choose Bronn to marry Lila, especially since they've already talked to my father?" 
Exhaling heavily, I felt sadness for Emily and her child. Bronn must realize it's crucial to follow his heart instead of just sticking to tradition. 
He should have some courage, really! I know he loves Emily-that's the biggest reason why I removed him from the possibility of being my future love. But fate had other plans, leading me to Philip-my hardworking, devoted husband.

**Bronn** 

After learning the reason why Emily's mother died back then, it became my vow to donate to a charity group whose mission is to help patients with heart disease. 
Since I went to the hospital to provide some donations, I made a brief visit to my doctor. 
The doctor told me that I was over-fatigued and lacking sleep, which is why my headaches were becoming more frequent. I was given medicine after receiving a stern lecture from the doctor about self-care. 
Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt held a little girl's hand in the hospital hallway. He's a client and also happens to be Philip Cornell's best friend, with some mutual friends in our circle. 
"Dr. Vanderbilt!" I greeted him. 
"Mr. Martin, you came again," he commented. 
"Yes. I'm getting older, so I'm visiting the hospital more often," I joked. 
He chuckled. Looking down at the little girl, a strange feeling washed over me. She has wavy blonde hair and bright blue eyes-the same as me and Ethan Vanderbilt, too! 
With curiosity, I asked, "Is she your daughter? Hello!" 
"Hello, uncle!" The little girl waved at me cheerfully. 
Dr. Vanderbilt grinned. "See? I told you, baby! I can be your daddy!" 
The little girl giggled. "You must really like my mommy a lot!" 
Ethan turned his attention back to me again. "Anyway, Sarah's assistant just asked me to look after her daughter for a bit. She had to run an errand at my dad's clinic in the building next door." 
My smile faded instantly. "Sarah's assistant?" I glanced down at the little girl, my jaw tightening. "You mean Emily?" 
"Yes, this is Willow," Ethan confirmed, gesturing towards the girl. "Emily's daughter."
###chapter 119: Love, Lost and Duty  
**Emily** 
To ensure her safety, Willow had to be brought back to the hospital so Dr. Vanderbilt could recheck her a week after she developed an allergy.  
Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt appeared in the hallway, prompting me to realize that my small bag had been left in his father's clinic. Requesting his assistance, I asked if Willow could stay with him since the clinic was in the neighboring building and I needed to go up to the third floor. 
Upon returning, my smile faded as I saw Dr. Ethan talking to none other than Bronn Martin at the end of the hallway.  
Shit! I gasped and quickly walked toward them. Casually greeting Ethan, I deliberately ignored Bronn's intense stare. 
"Thank you, Ethan!" I smiled at him. I was grateful that he and Willow got along well. We've met several times at Sarah and Philip Cornell's large villa in Serenity Pines Estates, and he's been kind to my daughter since her allergy. 
"You mentioned heading to Serenity Pines after this, right?" Ethan asked. "Why don't I take you there? Sarah's villa isn't far from here." 
"I appreciate the offer, but we don't want to be a burden," I replied. 
Bronn cleared his throat, the sound making my heart race. I feigned surprise as if noticing him. "Mr. Martin, I apologize if we're blocking the hallway and taking up your time." I turned to Robert and nodded at him. 
Bronn glanced at Willow with an interest. My stomach knotted. "Dr. Vanderbilt, I'll take Emily to Serenity Pines. Sarah and I have some pressing work matters to discuss anyway." 
I swallowed hard but didn't let my tension show. Being alone with Bronn and my child in an enclosed space was the absolute last thing I wanted. "Uhm, it's fine, Mr. Martin, really. I have a car with me." I took Willow's small hand in mine, squeezing it a bit too tightly. "Let's go, sweetie!" 
"Bye, uncles!" My daughter waved goodbye. 
We left without looking back, guiding Willow through the hospital's main entrance and into the bright afternoon sunlight. We needed to leave that place. When we reached the parking lot, I was startled as Bronn roughly turned me around after I had safely placed Willow in her seat. 
"Are you avoiding me, Emily?" Bronn Martin asked. 
I considered making an excuse, but a bitter laugh escaped my lips instead. "Shouldn't I be?" 
His eyes narrowed, a flash of realization crossing his face.  
"Now it makes sense! That daughter-is she Ethan's?" My heart pounded, and a mix of anger and hurt flooded through me. Why did I feel more insulted than accused by his assumption? 
"As far as I recall, Mr. Martin, I don't owe you any explanations," I retorted firmly. 
"But-" 
Forcefully removing his hand from my arm, I tried to ignore the familiar warmth of his touch. It pained me that he'd assume someone else was Willow's father. Then again, Bronn had never been interested in having children with me. 
It's my fault; our contract required me to take birth control pills. But with his frequent absences from the mansion, my stress from school, and my mother's condition, I haven't been diligent with my medication. 
Bronn's voice interrupted my thoughts. "Why did you have to come back, Emily?" he demanded, a hint of resentment in his tone. "Why did you leave back then, only to disturb my life now?" 
His accusation stung like a physical blow. "Fuck you, Bronn! Fuck you!" I hissed, careful to keep my voice down with Willow nearby. "Go back to Henderson or hide in BM Technologies! Just don't show up in front of me again. Don't ask me questions I have no answers for!" 
Suddenly, his hand was at the nape of my neck, pulling me close. His lips crashed against mine in a searing kiss-right there in broad daylight, with our confused child watching from the car. 
It was the kiss I'd longed for, the one I'd missed dearly. But it was from the very wrong man! 
Remembering Willow's presence, I pushed him away and slapped him hard across the face. Bronn's expression darkened as he touched his reddened cheek, but I saw him visibly restraining his anger. 
On the contrary, I stood my ground and discreetly glanced at him. 
"I know what you're doing, Mr. Martin. You're bored with your perfect life and decided to toy with me again. What is it this time-looking for a new contractual mistress to add to your collection? Well, I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm not that desperate girl anymore. I have a job and a boss who respects me, and I certainly don't need your blood money. The very thought is insulting!"  
I was seething with anger. My surprise peaked when the car door suddenly swung open, and Willow stepped out. She locked eyes with me and then with Bronn. 
"Why are you bullying my mommy? You're bad!" Willow shouted at Bronn. "I thought you were a nice uncle, but you're just a big bully!"  
Before I could react, Willow darted forward, her small hand connecting with Bronn's leg. 
"Willow!" 
Damn! 
I gasped, lunging forward to pull her back. She clung to my thigh, her body trembling against mine as she continued to glare at Bronn. Well, she definitely inherited Bronn's strong territorial attitude! 
"I hate you, uncle! You're a mean bully!" Willow shouted, her hand still raised as if to strike again. 
"Go back to Henderson, Mr. Martin!" I asserted firmly, guiding Willow back into the car. 
"Mommy, let's go home" she whimpered, tears starting to roll down her cheeks, confused as she glanced at Bronn. 
"We're going home, sweetie. Don't worry." 
As I adjusted her seat belt, Bronn spoke again. "Emily, I... I regret not coming back when your mother passed away. I didn't know you needed support so badly. I only discovered everything when I started searching for you after you left the mansion." 
I closed the car door and turned to him with a steely expression. His words reopened a painful wound, and tears welled up despite my hardened resolve. 
"No, Bronn. That was the day I realized I had fallen in love with the wrong man." 
As I spoke, I saw a flicker in Bronn's eyes-pain, regret, perhaps a trace of the love I once believed in. But by then, it was too late. 
I continued, my voice trembling with emotion, "That was the day you made me realize I meant nothing more to you than a sexual object. Do you know what happened between my mother and me before she died? She accused me of being just a mistress! I tried desperately to convince myself you treated me beyond that. But you proved her accusation right... and then she lost her life, leaving me alone with that bitter truth." 
Entering the car, I left the hospital parking lot. His figure remained in the side mirror, prompting uncontrollable sobs as he stirred up painful memories... 
"Mommy, please stop crying," Willow's small voice came from the back seat. "I hate that uncle! When is Daddy coming back? I'll ask Daddy to kick that uncle's butt!"  
Her small face twisted into a determined pout. 
I focused on the road ahead, my vision blurry as I drove away from the parking lot. The bitterness of the past weighed heavily on me. 
Days passed, and I foolishly thought everything was fine; Bronn had disappeared from my personal life, and I started to breathe easier.  
However, destiny had different intentions. During one of Sarah's business meetings centered around Love Logic, I unexpectedly encountered Bronn Martin once more. 
Bronn's face darkened upon seeing Sarah and me together, burned with accusation. 
"How long do you two intend to keep lying to me?" Bronn accused Sarah and me. 
Sarah stepped forward, her brow furrowed in confusion. "What are you talking about, Bronn?" 
Before I could even process what was happening, Bronn's following words shattered my world. 
"The truth about Willow! You hid it from me, Sarah! And you, Emily... you're the worst of all. Well, see you in court because I'll do everything possible to get my daughter!" 
My thoughts went blank, unable to process his words.
###chapter 120: Logic of Relationship 
**Sarah** 
Due to the growing team and the need for more space, an office was rented near Luminary Production's building. With my team expanding, this move was essential. Along with Emily, Amir provided me with two more assistants: Sophia, a sharp-witted woman in her early thirties with a background in marketing, and Mike, a finance expert around my age.  
None of my staff knows that I'm pregnant. I'd managed to keep it a secret within the people in Serenity Pines, even from Emily. 
After discussing some business matters, I decided to ask Emily about her relationship with Bronn.  
"I have a meeting with Bronn this afternoon to discuss some details about the LoveLogic app," I informed Emily as she sipped her coffee while I nursed a glass of calcium-rich milk, a new addition to my routine. 
Mentioning Bronn, I noticed a look of sadness in Emily's eyes.  
"Did something happen between the two of you?" I asked curiously. 
"I saw Mr. Martin at the hospital when I took Willow for a check-up. He he saw my daughter." 
I gasped, my curiosity deepening. "Did Bronn suspect that Willow is his daughter?" 
Emily shook her head. "The funny thing is, he thought Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt is Willow's father. Mr. Martin knows I've known Ethan's father for a long time. I guess he made the connection and assumed I was involved with the younger Dr. Vanderbilt." 
I grimaced, understanding how Bronn could have made that assumption. Ethan, with his striking blue eyes and naturally blonde hair, could easily pass as Willow's father. When I asked Ethan why he stopped coloring his hair, he said some patients lost trust in him. 
"That must have been awkward," I sympathized. "Jakob told me that Bronn is donating his share of the earnings from the non-player character to the hospital's charity, particularly to the department specializing in heart diseases," I continued. 
As I spoke, I noticed Emily's hand, resting on the countertop, clenched into a tight fist. We shifted our focus back to work to avoid further discussion about Bronn. 
I also read some articles as I monitored Lila's activities. In recent weeks, she has become more audacious, boldly using my name, Sarah Benner, in her social media profiles and interviews with local lifestyle magazines. 
I've let her be for the past few weeks, and it seems she's enjoyed the lack of confrontation. Every false claim, every stolen accomplishment, was another piece of evidence in my growing collection. The more Lila lied about her identity, the stronger my case against her became. 
As afternoon approached, Bronn arrived, flanked by his two imposing bodyguards and Robert Kingsley. The sour expression etched on Bronn's face spoke volumes before he even uttered a word. 
Bronn's voice thundered through the room as the door to my private office closed behind us, expressing his disappointment at my concealment of the truth about Willow. 
"How could you keep this from me?" he demanded, his eyes flashing with anger and hurt. "My own daughter, and I had no idea!" Turning to Emily, his voice took on a threatening edge. "I'll see you in court because I'll do everything possible to get my daughter!"  
Emily visibly trembled, her eyes widening in fear and shock. The color drained from her face as the weight of Bronn's words sank in. 
I intervened, trying to keep my voice steady. "Emily, Robert, could you please give Bronn and me a moment alone?" 
"B-But-" Emily stuttered, her voice trembling with uncertainty. 
I locked eyes with Bronn. Robert gently guided Emily out, closing the door behind them. 
As soon as we were alone, I couldn't contain my anger. "You're being an absolute asshole, Bronn!" 
His face tightened in irritation. 
"Sarah, anyone in my position would be furious! She hid my child from me-my own flesh and blood! The last time I saw Willow, she was furious with me. Emily kept her from me all this time! Don't I have the right to know about my own daughter?" 
"Have you ever considered that Emily might have had valid reasons? You're being selfish! This is exactly why she didn't tell you! Damn it, Bronn! How was Emily supposed to disclose your child when you never respected our feelings? You claim to love Emily, but all you do is hurt her!" 
Bronn squeezed his eyes shut, his jaw clenching as he absorbed my words. 
"I don't blame Emily for hiding Willow from you. Let's be honest: you never planned to have a child with her, did you? If you sue Emily and drag this paternity case to court, you'll put Willow in an impossible situation." 
My voice softened as I concluded, "Your public profile has grown significantly. By pursuing this, you're putting your daughter at risk. People will talk; they'll dig into Emily's past, into Willow's life" 
As I spoke, I noticed a shift in Bronn's demeanor. The anger in his eyes began to fade, replaced by a conflicted, almost vulnerable look.  
I continued, my voice laced with a mix of frustration and concern, " Bronn, the real problem is that you don't know what you truly want." 
His face darkened again, a familiar stubbornness creeping into his expression. "I follow tradition, Sarah... I do what's expected of me. That's how I was raised." 
"You're not twelve, Bronn! You're the head chief of BM Technologies, for heaven's sake! Can't you take charge of your own life, especially when it comes to your daughter?" I shook my head in disbelief. 
I paused, collecting my thoughts. "Emily confided in me about your relationship status before. I wanted to understand, to make sense of it all. I thought you were doing the right thing, which is why I distanced myself. But I never expected you to be still this conflicted after all this time." 
He explained, "I never planned to let go of Emily. I was just embarrassed in front of Grandpa Mitchell. I owe him a lot, so I was determined to reconcile with your family" 
"Then do something about it!" I urged. His earlier anger seemed to have calmed. He needed to persuade Emily; I knew they could still reconcile. A custody battle would ruin his relationship with my assistant. 
"Anyway, how did you find out about this?" I asked. 
"Jakob," Bronn replied simply. 
That rascal! Jakob and I had a decent conversation, but that man was as stubborn as they come! He even mentioned he was scared of ending our friendship over this! 
On the other note, Emily seemed hesitated to tell the truth. I took a deep breath to calm myself. 
"Talk to Emily, Bronn. Don't make this situation any more complicated than it already is!" 
"Our situation is already difficult, Sarah. It's been difficult for such a long time..." 
*** 
**Emily**  

Trembling has persisted since I entered Bronn Martin's car. The atmosphere was thick with tension, but I tried my best to ignore it. Sarah had graciously allowed me to leave the office early so I could properly introduce Willow to her father. 
A heavy sigh escaped me involuntarily. Robert, seated in the driver's seat, cast a glance at me through the rearview mirror while Bronn, occupying the backseat beside me, remained silent. 
"What are your plans, Mr. Martin?" I finally mustered the courage to ask, breaking our uneasy silence.
###chapter 121: Contractual Love Affair 
**Bronn** 
Emily and I were tense as the car made its way to her apartment. My chest churned with anticipation and resentment. Sarah's words from earlier echoed in my mind, reminding me that I had no right to question Emily's decisions. Given our complicated past, doing so would be selfish and hypocritical. 
When the car stopped in front of an apartment, I gave Robert an order. "Please leave me and Emily alone," I said firmly. 
"Certainly, Mr. Martin," Robert replied with a nod, his professional demeanor unwavering as he smoothly exited the vehicle, leaving Emily and me alone in the suddenly claustrophobic backseat. 
Emily's voice, tinged with nervousness, broke the silence. "What are your plans, Mr. Martin?" 
I inhaled deeply, the scent of her familiar perfume-a delicate mix of jasmine and vanilla-momentarily distracting me.  
"I just want to understand why you got pregnant," I began. "When we met at the hospital, why did you let me believe you and Ethan were together?" 
Emily's fist clenched on her lap. "I don't know either, Mr. Martin. When I went to Pennsylvania, I discovered I was pregnant. I realized I hadn't been as diligent with the birth control as our contract stipulated. I believed you were going to marry Sarah then, and I thought our situation with my child would complicate your life. I was convinced that keeping it to myself was the right thing to do." 
Emily was clearly putting up a wall between us, and her tears caught me off guard. 
"Bronn, my child is innocent of my past mistakes, so please let me keep Willow. Don't take her away from me." 
Emily's pain and sorrow hit me hard. I wanted to hug her and assure her I had no plans to take Willow away, but I was also struggling.  
After Jakob told me what he knew this morning, my parents informed me they were still committed to the Benners. They had replaced Sarah with Lila. 
At that moment, driven by desperation, guilt, and a spark of something I couldn't quite name, I made a decision that surprised me even. 
"I'm offering marriage to you, Emily," I blurted out. 
Her lips parted in surprise. "Marriage?" 
Maybe I was desperate, trying to regain control of a situation slipping away from me quickly. Sarah was right; I had been denying the truth because it was harder to face than lying about it. I couldn't stand the idea of marrying Lila either; she was using Sarah's name, and it irked me, but Emily didn't need to know that. 
"Think about it carefully. I'll send you the contract for review. Take your time to consider all aspects." 
Emily's face soured at the mention of the 'contract,' but she didn't respond. 
Emily took a deep breath, steeling herself before speaking. "About Willow... please, let me explain our situation to her." 
"Alright..." I followed Emily, exited the car, and observed their apartment. It was a decent home located in a safe community area. 
"It's one of the perks Sarah provided as part of my role as her assistant," Emily explained, noticing my glance around. "I receive many benefits from being her assistant, so I stay in the job. She's a good boss who values my contributions to her team." 
I was keenly aware of Emily's remarkable work ethic. No other woman had ever captured my heart like she had, yet I continued to lie about it. My eyes were drawn to her lips, full and inviting in the soft light. The urge to kiss her was almost overwhelming, but I controlled my desire and resolved to stay calm. 
"Mommy!" The door swung open, and Willow emerged. Emily smiled and embraced our daughter. My heart raced; although Willow had inherited Emily's beautiful face, she had my blue eyes and blonde hair. 
The little girl turned her gaze to me, her expression souring. She folded her small arms and scowled. "Mister, why are you here? Are you bullying my mommy again?" 
I almost chuckled at her cuteness. To emphasize her displeasure, she had stopped referring to me as "uncle" and now addressed me only as "mister," as if she had severed any connection between us. Our previous encounters had not been pleasant. 
"I came here to apologize to you..." I said softly, trying to convey my sincerity. 
"Hmph! I don't need your apologies! I hate people who bully my mommy! Like Ms. Erica! I only like Auntie Evelyn and Uncle Ethan!" 
I couldn't help but scratch my head, feeling amused and overwhelmed. It was becoming clear that gaining Willow's approval might be more complicated than patching things up with Emily. 
"Um..." 
Willow dashed back into the house, leaving me uncertain of my next move. 
"I think it's best to earn Willow's trust first. If we reveal I'm her father right away, it could be overwhelming and potentially traumatic," I explained to Emily, who nodded in agreement. 
My situation with Emily grew more complicated. We entered the house and surveyed the surroundings where my daughter lived. Yet, the knowledge that Willow had been living here, under a roof that wasn't mine, stirred a deep discomfort within me.  
In the living room, Willow seemed determined to ignore my presence. She was engrossed in play with her teddy bear. 
Emily cleared her throat softly. "I apologize for my daughter's behavior," she said. "The hospital incident has left her with a different impression."  
"It's alright. Let's give her some space for now. Emily, please consider my proposal. Let me give Willow the family she deserves," I implored. 
Emily nodded, though her expression betrayed her reservations. 
My proposal was straightforward: a discreet marriage to Emily, ensuring our personal lives remained private, which was crucial given my position, followed by us starting a family together in Henderson. However, Emily's life and career were firmly established here in Highland Hills, adding complexity to the situation. I needed to discuss this with Sarah and obtain her approval for Emily to relocate. 
When I sent Emily the contract outlining my proposal, I hadn't anticipated her disapproval. 
"I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. I'm declining the offer. I'm sorry, but I can't accept these terms" 
*** 

**Emily** 
"Why did you turn down Bronn's marriage proposal, Emily?" Sarah's voice came through clearly on our video conference. As usual, she was at Serenity Pines, her familiar personal office visible in the background. 
"I have to be honest with you; Bronn reached out to me. He shared his plans about moving you and Willow to Henderson. It would be difficult for me if you moved into Bronn's mansion because it would undoubtedly increase my workload. On the other hand, you would be my support at BM Technologies and for various business engagements in Las Vegas and Henderson. So, after careful consideration, I gave my approval." 
"Sarah, I don't want to be just a contractual love affair for Bronn Martin. It hurts me deeply. I'd rather forget he ever existed in my life." 
I still can't believe Bronn would impose those terms in his contract. Yes, I wanted to give Willow a real family, especially now that her father was in the picture. But Bronn's approach felt like a slap in the face, reducing our potential relationship to another business transaction. 
"He sent you a contract?" Sarah was shocked, understanding my concerns. "I assumed he was proposing a standard prenuptial agreement." 
"What if I can't comply with what's in the contract? I can't bear the thought of Willow getting hurt the way I was before." 
The heartbreak Bronn left in my heart was undeniably painful. The last thing I wanted was for our daughter to experience that kind of heartbreak. 
After talking with Sarah, I took off my coat and went downstairs to spend some time with my daughter, only to be surprised to find Bronn sitting beside Willow on the sofa. 
"Mommy! Daddy brought me food!" Willow exclaimed happily, enjoying her clubhouse sandwich. My gaze shifted to the sandwich I used to adore. 
'They're already close? And how had Bronn already earned the title of 'dad'? 
"Your dad?" I echoed, raising an eyebrow at Bronn. "Mr. Martin, I never knew you were so good at charming people with food." 
Bronn's lips curved into a broad smile. "And you haven't changed a bit. Still capable of seducing me effortlessly." His eyes traveled down my body, then back up to meet my gaze. "Quite a view, by the way." 
It took me a moment to realize he was referring to my attire-a thin white top and no bra, as I hadn't planned on leaving the house. My nipples were clearly visible.  
'Damn it!' 
Cursing under my breath, I hurried back upstairs to change.
###chapter 122: Through the Husband's Eyes 
**Sarah**  
For several months now, I've been residing at Serenity Pines Estate. Standing before the full-length mirror inside the wardrobe, I observe my growing belly. At 24 weeks pregnant, my belly is a prominent dome, growing more pronounced daily.  
I noticed Philip leaning casually against the door, a soft smile playing on his lips, making me feel cherished.  
"So sexy!" he exclaimed.  
I can't help but pout, my insecurities bubbling to the surface. "You don't find me ugly?" I asked curiously.  
"Not at all," he assured me, crossing the room with long strides. His strong arms encircled me from behind, placing a tender kiss on my temple. "You are more beautiful than ever," he muttered.  
His words tickled my heart, spreading warmth through my chest. But there's a playful glint in his eye as he added, "What if I did find you unattractive?"  
"Nothing I've experienced worse. It's nothing if you find me unattractive." The thought hurt, bringing back memories of past rejections and insecurities that threatened to resurface.  
Philip caressed my round belly and let his lips trail along my neck, looking at my reflection in the mirror. "You are even more beautiful, my love."  
I shared with Philip what was on my mind: "I was supposed to attend a stockholders' meeting on the next day, but it's impossible for me to go in person. At this point, I will unlikely leave Serenity Pines Estate in my condition" I paused, considering my words carefully. "I was thinking of giving you authorization for some of my accounts."  
That would be fine, especially since Philip and I are legally married. My child's safety is more important than the stock market and the meetings I must attend.  
Philip fell silent, his brow furrowing in contemplation. His hands continued their soothing circles on my belly, but I could sense the wheels turning in his mind.  
I urged him further, "Come on, Philip. Emily is moving to Henderson. She's accepted Bronn's proposal, so asking her to handle transactions as my assistant isn't feasible anymore."  
Philip caressed my shoulder and then explained, "It's fine, babe. I want to help you, too; I'm just thinking about Amir and your Grandpa Mitchell. I don't know how they'll take our plan."  
Noticing me shivering, Philip fetched some clothes and carefully dressed me.  
"My grandfather will understand me, but I'm sure Amir will question me."  
Without warning, Philip scooped me into his arms, cradling me against his chest. Over these past months, his pampering and attention have only made me fall more in love with him. I breathed in his comforting scent as he carried me towards the kitchen.  
"Did you want something to eat?" he asked, peering into the fridge.  
"Anything!" I exclaimed.  
Philip quickly gathered colorful ingredients on the granite countertop. He picked out a thick piece of wild-caught salmon and placed it alongside fresh asparagus, cherry tomatoes, and sliced bell peppers. After arranging them neatly on a baking tray, he drizzled olive oil over everything and put it in the oven.  
"Anyway, I'm happy to help you, babe. I feel more comfortable with you here at Serenity Pines. I'll pick you up later tonight for the hospital. Ethan confirmed your check-up is scheduled for tonight," Philip murmured.  
That night, we learned my children were fine-yes, babies! Tears welled up when the doctor revealed we were expecting a girl and a boy, explaining my larger belly.  
Overjoyed, we decided Philip would take over some of my commitments. I needed to be more cautious.  
As we headed back to Serenity Pines from the hospital hallway, Philip received a call from his father's assistant.  
"Yes?" Philip answered, his body visibly tensing as he listened. The color drained from his face. "I understand. I'm on my way."  
"What happened, Philip?" I asked, unable to hide my concern.  
"There's been an incident with my mother at the prison, Sarah. I have to go there right away." He swiftly called Trey and another security team member, telling them to escort me safely back to Serenity Pines.  
Feeling anxious and uncertain, I grabbed my phone and messaged Jane, sure she would know more:  
Me: Has something happened to Madam Cornell?  
My ride pulled up to the Serenity Pines backyard, but there was no reply from Jane. Once inside the villa, I hurried to our shared master suite, quickly changing into more comfortable clothes while my mind raced with worried thoughts.  
An hour passed with no word from Jane, even after midnight. Unable to sleep, I returned to the kitchen for milk. As I prepared it, I found Josh drinking coffee outside the main door.  
Seeking company in my restlessness, I made my way outside to join him.  
"Hey!" I greeted Josh.  
He glanced at my swollen belly before returning his focus to his coffee.  
"I'm the one assigned to guard through the night, so here I am, relying on coffee," Josh remarked.  
"Do you have any idea what's happening with the Cornells?" I asked curiously.  
Josh paused for a moment, and I sensed he knew something. "It would be better if your husband tells you," he replied cryptically.  
We fell into a peaceful silence, surrounded by the calm night. The air hummed with chirping insects, and a soft breeze gently stirred the leaves. The comforting scent of coffee and milk filled the air.  
"Sarah," Josh began hesitantly, "I've decided to leave Philip's team. My former hospital reached out to me a few months ago; they want me back."  
"Oh! They've been trying to get you back for a while. What made you decide just now?" I said, believing in Josh's capability to handle his work, having seen him manage my panic attacks and episodes.  
"Because I need to watch over you, Sarah," he said softly, a small smile playing on his lips. "Knowing you're building a life with Philip, starting a family, puts my mind at ease. I won't have to worry about him hurting you, sending you back to what you went through."  
"Thank you, Dr. Daniel Caldwell," I grinned back, using his real name.  
"I have one last favor to ask," he said.  
Before I could react, Josh held my nape, and his lips pressed mine. Shocked, I stood frozen, my eyes wide with surprise.  
"What's going on here?" My anxiety shot up in a single line from my back to my neck upon hearing Philip's voice.  
Josh stepped back, glaring at Philip. I saw Philip trembling, his eyes darkened with a mix of emotions. I hadn't even noticed he had returned.  
Gasping as Philip's hand connected with Josh's cheek in a sharp punch, I quickly covered my mouth, realizing the terrible misunderstanding he must have had upon finding us outside our house at this late hour.  
"Philip, wait!" I cried desperately, my voice cracking. "It's not what you think!" My heart raced as I tried to reach him.  
"I've had suspicions about your loyalty from the beginning!" Philip shouted through gritted teeth, his demeanor darkening.  
"Heh" a sardonic smile playing on Josh's lips. "And I've always known you were a first-class asshole! I can't believe Sarah forgave you even after locking her in the closet. But what can we do? But I suppose that's what love does to people!"  
Josh's words struck Philip hard, leaving me feeling like cold water had been poured over my realization. He was about to lunge at Josh, and without hesitation, I threw myself forward, grabbing Philip's arm with both hands.  
"Stop it, both of you!" I shouted, my voice echoing in the night air. "Just leave, Josh, please. I will forget this night ever happened." I exclaimed, my chest heaving with mixed emotions. I still couldn't believe he kissed me.  
As I glanced around, I noticed several of the estate's staff watching our commotion. I wished desperately for the ground to open up and swallow me whole.  
Philip pulled his arm away from me. His eyes, full of hurt and betrayal, wouldn't meet mine. Without saying a word, he turned and stormed toward Serenity Pines' main building while Josh was escorted towards the estate's gates.  
Fear shook me. I remembered when Philip caught me with someone in our room before and kicked me out of Serenity Pines. Tears cascaded down my cheeks.  
Alex, who had been nearby, approached me.  
"Madam Sarah, I'm not sure what happened, but I know you're innocent... Please understand the boss. He needs you now more than ever."  
Alex's following words sent a chill down my spine, leaving me breathless.
###chapter 123: Unspoken Fears 
**Sarah** 
"What happened?" I asked Alex. My heart pounded in my chest, and I tasted the salt of my tears as they streamed down my face.  
Alex placed a comforting hand on my shoulder before continuing, sending a shock through my very core. "Madam Cornell," he began, his voice low and somber, "she... she took her own life in prison this afternoon." 
A gasp escaped my lips as my hand flew to my mouth. My mind went blank. 
"W-what?" I stammered, my mouth agape. 
"That's why, Madam Sarah Please the Boss needs you now more than ever." 
A thousand questions raced through my mind for Alex, many things to say, but I chose to keep them to myself. Taking a deep, shaky breath, I steeled myself and entered the imposing building. 
Inside, I found Philip. In his hand was a crystal tumbler, half-filled with his favorite 30-year-old scotch. The amber liquid cast a warm glow, starkly contrasting the cold tension that filled the room. 
"Philip, I was also shocked that Josh did that to me. Please, you have to believe me" The fear of rejection, of being cast out like before when my mother-in-law framed me, clawed at my insides. 
Philip lifted his gaze to me. His eyes, filled with pain, met mine. 
"Sarah, I can't... I can't lose you. I... I just can't." Philip's body trembled, and I could hear the fear in his voice. 
Crossing the room with cautious but determined steps, I gently took his free hand, feeling the slight tremor in his fingers.  
"Philip, you should know by now that I am always choosing you," I paused to sob. 
Philip gently pulled me closer, wrapping me in his arms. I felt his heart beating rapidly, and I caught the familiar scent of his cologne mixed with the aroma of scotch. 
"Ever since I woke up from the coma, I realized and felt a unique understanding between you and Josh that I couldn't grasp. It's like he knows parts of you that I can't reach, that you can share things with him you can't with me. I was jealous of your relationship but kept it to myself because I didn't want to ruin what we have" 
His grip tightened slightly. 
"I keep asking myself if I have the right to feel this way. To want to claim you, to own you Do I have the right to be jealous?" His voice broke. "When I saw you outside, late at night, having a deep conversation with Josh, I was terrified, Sarah. I... I can't lose you. I just can't."  
As he spoke, I felt the dam of his emotions break. His body shook with silent sobs, and I felt the warm wetness of his tears on my shoulder. 
"As each day passes, Philip, I find myself falling deeper in love with you," I whispered, my voice thick with emotion. "I can't imagine a life without you anymore." 
Maybe if we had discussed this during the first few weeks Philip and I met, my answer would have been different-I wouldn't have accepted Philip. But here I am now, my feelings for him deepening even more. He's shown me he deserves my love. 
Philip's thumb gently caressed my cheek, wiping away a stray tear. He leaned in, pressing his lips to mine in a tender kiss. The saltiness of his tears mingled with the sweetness of his lips, creating a bittersweet moment that spoke volumes. 
"I love you, Sarah" he murmured against my lips, his eyes tightly shut as if to hold back the flood of emotions threatening to overwhelm him. He was hurting deeply. 
Without warning, Philip scooped me up in his arms, cradling me against his chest as he carried me to the bedroom. He laid me down gently on the bed before lying beside me, his face mere inches from my stomach. I understood his need for closeness, for the comfort of holding each other in this intimate space. 
I ran my fingers through Philip's dark locks as his hand found its way to my swollen belly, fingers splaying protectively over our unborn child. 
"About Josh," I began hesitantly, "he's a psychiatrist If you've noticed that I often confide in him, it's because I've been consulting with him professionally. Josh has been a great help to me since we met. He helped me through my panic attacks naturally, without relying on medication that could harm me." 
Philip lifted his gaze to mine. "But you can't deny that he fell for you, Sarah." 
"There's nothing I can do about it" 
But I blame myself for not realizing Josh's feelings sooner... I never imagined he could love anyone other than Megan. 
Philip's hand tightened slightly on my belly.  
"When I saw Josh kiss you, I felt this intense fear grip me... my anxiety is overwhelming me right now," he murmured. 
"I heard about your mother" I said gently, trying to gauge his reaction. 
"I can't believe she would do that. It's like she realized there was no way out of prison and chose... self-exit." He swallowed hard. "I feel so embarrassed and hurt, Sarah. Even in her final moments, she was selfish. It's... it's hard to process."  
Philip's voice was low and pained as he continued, "My parents never had a great relationship. My dad saw my mom as little more than a prop in his carefully constructed image of paternal success. While my mom, She was deeply manipulative. My father saw that as an asset in the ruthless business world. Many business partners favored my mom, like Madam Olsen" 
His eyes met mine, filled with regret and a desperate need for understanding. 
"I grew up surrounded by that toxicity, never knowing what real love looked like. That's why I couldn't give you the time and attention you deserved when we first got married. I mistook you for my mother, influenced by her portrayal of you as a user..." 
Philip's words made me clench my fists. 
"I'm truly sorry, my love..." Philip whispered, his lips brushing against my belly in a tender kiss. "I should have known better. Should have trusted my heart instead of the poison my mother fed me." 
Silence enveloped us; Philip's hand continued its gentle caress of my rounded stomach while my fingers threaded through his hair, offering comfort in the quiet intimacy of touch. 
*** 
During the video call with Amir, he was astounded by my plans. Although I hadn't mentioned what transpired between Philip and me, I did bring up Madam Cornell's passing. 
"I'm saddened by Philip losing his mother, but honestly, I'm frustrated, brother! I haven't discussed this with my husband yet because the timing isn't right. For now, I'm letting Philip have his space to mourn." 
Amir's expression darkened further, his thick eyebrows knitting together. 
"I understand your conflicted feelings, Sarah, but I can't wrap my head around you giving Philip access to some of your accounts and shares. Have you completely lost your mind?" His voice rose. "I don't trust that man!"  
His irritation was evident on the screen. 
Anticipating his reaction, all I could do was explain. "I know what I'm doing, brother! Right now, Emily is among the people I trust, but she's relocating to Henderson. The secretaries you've recommended are fine, but Emily is different. Though we've only known each other briefly, I feel a deep sense of comfort and trust with her. I can't think of anyone else besides Philip who could handle some of these intricate business transactions." 
"Sarah, listen to yourself! Have you considered even a moment that Philip might be plotting revenge? He's betrayed you once. Who's to say he won't do it again? Think about it: his mother just passed away.  
"Do you really expect Philip to not harbor ill intentions toward you? Are you certain about his feelings for you? Remember, you nearly lost your life because of Philip before! From where I stand, Philip will always prioritize his mother's love over anything else, including you!" 
Amir's point gave me pause. I understood his concern, but surely, I won't let Philip hurt me a second time. I've grown, I've learned, and I'm stronger now! 
Right?
###chapter 124: Emotional Tug-of-War  
**Philip** 
The streetlights blurred as I stared out the car window, my mind a whirlwind of emotions on the way back to Serenity Pines. 
I had just come from the police station, where I met my father, who had a grim look throughout the process. My mother died in prison. The news of my mother's suicide in prison hit me like a physical blow. Even though she had become a bad person, Madam Cornell was still my mother. It pained me to think she had managed to hurt Sarah. 
Dad had taken on the grim responsibility of identifying and claiming Mom's body. 
My mind was in chaos as the car approached Serenity Pines. It must have been around one in the morning, and Sarah was probably curled on the bed. I checked my phone and saw a message from her, which had been sent hours ago. 
***Sarah:*** *Is everything alright, Philip?* 
My throat tightened. No, nothing was alright.  
I decided to tell Sarah the truth in person, so I didn't respond to her message. Besides, she was likely asleep by now. 
I got out of the vehicle and saw Sarah outside with Josh. What was she doing? Why was she out there? Above all, why did it seem like they were having a serious conversation? 
With a dark expression, I approached them. Before I could close the distance between us, he did the unthinkable-he leaned in and kissed Sarah. Time stood still. My vision narrowed on the spot where Josh's lips met my wife's. A primal rage surged through me, and my fists clenched involuntarily. 
He dared to touch what's mine! 
In that eternal moment, all I could think was: Is this it? Is she leaving me? 
*** 
Sarah and I reconciled quickly after the incident I witnessed. The misunderstanding was resolved, and our bond grew stronger after enduring yet another challenge. Now, here I am at the cemetery, emotions swirling beneath a calm exterior. 
It was late afternoon. There was a drizzle, so most attendees held black umbrellas as they paid their last respects to my mother, Madam Cornell. 
Familiar faces filled the crowd: long-lost relatives, my friend Ethan, and even some business associates like Bronn and Madam Olsen. Despite the turmoil inside me, I maintained a stoic façade, my face betraying no emotion. 
Jane decided to stay away and focus on her day at work instead. I understood her choice; the trauma from her abduction by my mother was still fresh, with both physical and emotional wounds yet to heal. Sarah also stayed at Serenity Pines Estate, a wise decision considering the reporters circling the cemetery's outskirts. 
I didn't notice when the people at the cemetery started to leave one by one. My friend Ethan was beside me, supporting me, along with a few guards. 
After a while, Trey's voice interrupted my thoughts. "We need to go, boss!" 
I nodded, turning towards the waiting car. As I did, I thought I saw someone by a big oak tree-just for a moment, I thought it was Sarah, but she quickly disappeared from my sight. 
To ensure that Sarah wasn't around, I called her phone. 
"Hello!" Sarah answered. 
"What are you doing right now?" I asked, my eyes still fixed on the tree. 
"Finalizing your character in the LoveLogic app," she replied. 
Does that mean she's home? 
My brow furrowed. "My character?" 
"Yes. Philip, your character was completed by Lexi, and it was so handsome! I almost don't want to release it to the public. If I didn't think about my team's effort and the potential earnings for our app..." 
For the first time that day, a smile tugged at my lips. "You're probably ogling over the AI version of me." 
"Of course not! That's being a pervert!" 
"You are a pregnant pervert. You just admitted it to me..." 
"Did I?" She's so cute when she's confused. I'm so fucking in love with this woman. God, how I wanted to see her, to hold her and feel the swell of her belly where our babies grew. 
Right now, she's the person I need the most. 
"Please take care of yourself," I reminded her. 
Sarah was in a challenging situation, compelled to stay at Serenity Pines and work there. 
"I will, babe!" Sarah replied. "Pick up some delicious buns from the bakery near Luminary Productions before you return home. Bye!" 
After ending the call with Sarah, Ethan turned to me, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. 
"I never thought Sarah was the key to making you smile. It's almost cringe-worthy how obsessed you are!" 
"Crazy!" I retorted, shaking my head at Ethan's comment. My gaze returned to the old oak tree on the edge of the property. "I thought I saw her standing there earlier. That's why I called her-to see if she'd managed to sneak out somehow." 
Ethan glanced toward where I had pointed. Trey looked alarmed and instructed another guard to check the spot. Whether it was Sarah or not, caution was necessary. 
Moments later, the guard returned, slightly out of breath. "Boss, there's no one there. I checked the surrounding area, too-all clear." 
"You were probably just missing Sarah," Ethan commented. 
Possible. The thought repeated in my mind, bringing a surge of longing. 
"Boss, we should get going," my other guard remarked. 
Glancing at my watch, I realized it was time to meet Mariano's group. I sighed heavily, feeling anger resurface. 
"Could you give Ethan and me some space?" I requested of my guards, my tone leaving no room for argument. 
They nodded silently and moved away, positioning themselves at a respectful distance but still within sight. 
"What's your plan, Philip?" Ethan inquired softly. 
"It's about Josh. I saw him kissing my wife, Sarah," I gritted my teeth, speaking in a low voice. 
"What?" Ethan exclaimed, clearly confused. 
"Ethan," I said, gripping his arms tightly and looking him directly in the eyes, "if something happens to me during this meeting, I need you to promise me you'll ensure Sarah and the babies are safe. No matter what." 
Confusion and alarm warred in Ethan's expression. "What does that even mean, Philip? What are you planning?" 
"I have to confront Mariano's team because Josh is his people. This meeting is inevitable since Josh has unexpectedly chosen to leave my team. I question his motives even more. It's not me he's been watching over all this time-it's Sarah!" 
Ethan's eyes widened as he glanced around at our companions, ensuring we weren't overheard. "What exactly are you implying?" 
"It's not easy to leave Mariano's team, especially if you know as much about his operations as I do. Yet Mariano allowed Josh to leave my team without any fuss. Don't you find that suspicious? I think Mariano deliberately placed Josh in my team to watch over Sarah." 
Ethan paused, processing this revelation. "Wait, are you saying Mariano wanted to protect Sarah?" 
I nodded firmly. That's right! Josh was always there for Sarah, ensuring she recovered fully from her panic attacks. Now that my wife is improving, Mariano suddenly allows Josh to leave my team. 
"You know what I'm thinking?" I continued, lowering my voice even further. "I think Mariano might be one of Sarah's family. Maybe Amir, her father, or Grandpa Mitchell!"
###chapter 125: Her Defender 
**Philip** 
Ethan's brow furrowed as he contemplated our conversation. After a moment of silence, he spoke, his voice laced with confusion. "But I always thought you had already met Mariano." 
"That's what I thought, too, Ethan. But now, I'm not so sure. I'm Luminary Productions' President, and the man I've always met is probably an actor hired by the real Mariano. Everyone thinks I've met the real him, but I'm starting to doubt if that person was real either." 
An image of Mariano flashed in my mind-a distinguished man in a business suit, always with a cigar between his fingers. The scent of expensive tobacco seemed to linger in my memory. 
I'm genuinely confused, or perhaps the real Mariano has been manipulating my understanding. 
"Now that I think about what you said, you met Mariano during your first marriage with Sarah. There's a possibility he was keeping a close eye on you because of Sarah," Ethan commented. 
I nodded slowly, pieces starting to fall into place. "And Madam Olsen, I think she had suspicions, which is why she tried to invite Sarah away when I was in a coma. It makes more sense now."  
Recounting the events, "I stole Sarah's file from Madam Olsen, and that's where I found out the truth about her identity. Mariano's assistant-that snake- took action, ordering their people to kill Sarah. But Sarah was safe, and that assistant ended up dead instead." 
Ethan added, "But Mariano punished you, assigning you to ensure Sarah would join the race." 
I responded to Ethan, "But Amir spoke to me when I went to Dubai. He made sure I wouldn't involve Sarah in my recklessness. Grandpa Mitchell did the same. They were protecting my wife Mariano ordered me to ensure Sarah would join the race, fully aware that I would carefully consider it.  
"That's why I was compelled to participate in a death-defying race as punishment, which I believe was his true intention. He created this elaborate illusion of targeting Sarah, but she was never in danger. I'm the one who's frequently at risk." 
Ethan pondered deeply. "And let's not forget, when Sarah made her escape to find you in Romania, Josh was there. They both encountered Amir at the airport. It's like he was always one step ahead." 
Precisely! Amir was in the picture even when Sarah divorced me the first time. But here's the thing: I don't think Amir could be Mariano. The person behind Mariano's identity... I get the sense they're much older and more experienced than any of us. 
"Grandpa Mitchell has a reputation in business, and so does Mariano! Sarah's grandfather was a brilliant economist, and Mariano taught me how to manipulate prices and create artificial demand to maximize profits. The only other person I know with that level of expertise is Grandpa Mitchell." 
Ethan let out a heavy sigh, his face etched with concern. "Whatever it is, please ensure your safety. I'll protect Sarah, but you must return safely. What's your plan exactly? Why are you meeting with Mariano's team?" 
"It's protocol since Josh is under my team. I disagreed with Josh to leave without facing consequences from Mariano's whole organization. And I'm not alone in this-Mariano's advisor and some of his top men share my sentiment. They want Josh to face repercussions." 
"What kind of consequences are we talking about here? This isn't just a slap on the wrist, is it?" 
"Anything's possible."  
Ethan's curiosity was palpable. I had already shared a dangerous amount of information with him, and I didn't want to burden him with more. 
"Mariano sent me to a dangerous place after I retrieved a document from Madam Olsen, which landed me in a coma. He shouldn't make things any easier for Josh either." 
*** 
The helicopter's blades quieted as we landed on the island, the mansion standing prominently atop the hill. My thoughts spun with the recent events: my mother's funeral and the cryptic conversation with Ethan. 
Mariano's new assistant greeted me and escorted me into the conference room inside the mansion.  
The conference room exuded luxury with dark mahogany panels, plush leather chairs, and a prominent round table. At the center, a modern speaker system surrounded by microphones awaited. As I settled into my chair, I locked eyes with Josh. Tension filled the air between us, a silent battle of determination. 
Orlie, my racing manager, sat beside me. "I heard about your mother. My condolences," he muttered.  
I stayed quiet, allowing the gravity of recent events to linger. The room gradually filled, each newcomer adding to the tension and uncertainty in the air. 
"Good afternoon, gentlemen," Mariano's voice filled the room. It was unmistakably him but altered-more powerful, more authoritative. It was the real Mariano, not the impersonator I'd grown accustomed to. "We are gathered here to vote on whether to discipline Josh for his desire to leave Philip's team." 
Raising my hand, I sought clarification.  
"Yes, Philip?" Mariano's voice responded. I glanced around, noticing cameras strategically placed in each corner of the room-Mariano could see every twitch, every glance. 
I cleared my throat before speaking up. "I want to clarify my position. I support removing Josh from my team."  
Casting a sidelong glance at Josh, I couldn't shake the concern over his close proximity to my wife and its potential complications. The thought alone made my blood boil.  
"However," I continued, "I also question his loyalty to our organization as a whole. Allowing him to leave so easily might lead Josh to divulge sensitive information to the public." 
"I don't know much! All I know is to watch you wherever you go!" Josh retorted loudly. 
Tension filled the room, and I felt everyone's eyes on me. Something inside me snapped. 
"If he can leave that easily," I said, my voice rising, "then I want to get out, too!" 
Orlie gasped audibly beside me, his mouth hanging open in shock. The room fell into stunned silence. 
I'm earning more now, yes. I've learned a lot about business under Mariano's guidance. But leaving this fuckery-this constant tension and danger- that's what I truly desire right now! 
My thoughts raced to Sarah and the twins she was carrying. I wanted to build a family with her the right way, be present, and be the father my children deserved.  
Josh's potential departure had inadvertently sparked my buried desires, but I knew full well the impossibility of my request. But I had to do this for my growing family. 
"Fine!" Mariano's voice crackled through the speaker. "I will allow you to leave, Philip. But you have to fight against Josh." 
My eyes narrowed, muscles tensing as I locked gazes with Josh across the table. 
"You will go against each other in a battle to the death. The survivor earns their freedom from the group." He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. "And it all must be resolved within two hours." 
We filed out of the conference room in silence. Mariano's assistant swiftly prepared the battleground located in the sea. Mariano's business partners began placing bets and prepared to watch online as they gambled on our lives. The two-hour deadline now made sense; Mariano aimed to maximize his profit from the situation. 
Orlie grabbed my arm, his face a mix of fury and disbelief.  
"Philip! What madness is this?!" he hissed. 
"I want to leave, too, Orlie! That's what I mean! You know I want out of here!" 
"But are you out of your mind? You just recovered from a coma! You escaped death once, and now you're willing to try again?" 
I didn't tell him that I had anticipated this outcome. That's why I had instructed Ethan to take care of Sarah if anything happened to me. Locked in a fierce gaze with Josh, my fist clenched, I was driven by the desire to retaliate against him for kissing Sarah. 
But this was no simple fistfight. One of us would be dead in two hours.
###chapter 126: Viper Turf War 
**Philip**  
The battle between Josh and me will take place in the middle of the sea, two kilometers from the island's shore. It's called a Viper Turf War.  
The battleground is an engineering marvel-a square platform made of thick hydro foam, built to float and move with the ocean's waves. It's anchored to the seabed and operated by a high-tech remote system, but its real challenge comes from the relentless strength of the waves. Crates line the sides, containing either weapons or nothing at all.  
I know Mariano is sick! And the money he'd earn from this battle is no small amount. Maybe it's foolish, or perhaps I'm just determined, but I'll do this to escape this mess, just like Josh! It's just a bonus that I want to hurt him for the stolen kiss he gave my wife. Now, I'm even more suspicious that Mariano is doing this because of Sarah. That man wants to see me dead!  
The time is thirty minutes to seven in the evening. Besides the waves, the approaching darkness would make an already dangerous situation even harder. A network of powerful spotlights mounted on hovering drones cast an eerie glow over the battleground. These drones, along with fixed cameras at each corner of the platform, ensure that every moment of the fight is captured in high definition for the gamblers watching from afar.  
Josh and I changed into simple wetsuits. As I waited, I dialed Sarah's number with trembling fingers. The weight of possibly saying goodbye without her knowing pressed heavily on my chest.  
"Hey, babe!" Sarah greeted cheerfully.  
Guilt filled my chest at the sound of her voice. "I'll ask Assistant Alex to bring you the buns, my love. I have some work to finish."  
"It's fine. How are you?" Sarah asked.  
"I'm alright It's just that" Fuck! I don't even know what to say!  
After a moment of silence, she ventured a guess. "Is this about your mother, Philip? I know the funeral was hard on you."  
"No, my love. I" I paused, gathering courage. "I love you so much, Sarah!" I finally said. This might be the last time I tell her that.  
"I love you too, Philip! Truth is, I've been worried about you. I'm glad you called, even if it's just for a moment"  
I clenched my fist tightly. I'm so selfish that Sarah doesn't know what's about to happen. She probably assumed I was dealing with the aftermath of my mother's funeral. If only she knew the truth-that her husband was about to engage in a potentially fatal battle on a floating platform in the middle of the ocean.  
"Take a rest for a moment. Just tell Alex if you need anything," I gently reminded her.  
"Okay! Please be back soon! Bye, babe!" She ended the call.  
I immediately typed a message to Alex: 'Keep Sarah safe at Serenity Pines. I'm at Mariano's sprawling mansion, about to enter a brutal battle in the infamous Viper Turf War.'  
I imagined Sarah's image, her round belly with our growing twins. The thought of her waiting, hoping for my return, ignited a fierce determination within me.  
Alex's reply was swift: 'A life-or-death challenge? Boss, I understand it's for Sarah, but have you considered all the risks? Are you absolutely certain about this?'  
Before I could respond, Mariano's stern-faced assistant announced, "Mr. Cornell and Josh, it's time to leave!"  
I nodded grimly and moved to follow, but Orlie suddenly appeared, his muscular frame blocking my path on the shore.  
"Philip!" he called, staring at me intently.  
I looked at him apologetically, conveying a silent message. This was the second time Orlie had stopped me on my way to a deadly fight. I hoped I would once again cheat death and come out victorious.  
A sleek, black yacht sliced through rough waters, carrying us toward our destiny. Alongside Josh and me were Orlie, Mariano's assistant; three tech experts focused on sophisticated equipment; and six other leaders.  
The yacht stopped a few meters away from the hydrofoam platform being tossed by the waves. The battleground, barely larger than a boxing ring, lacked safety barriers, emphasizing its intent to challenge us at every step.  
It's been a few months since I recovered from the coma, and I've been exercising at Serenity Pines or the Luminary Productions gym. I placed my trust in this hard-earned strength and my finely-tuned instincts.  
The assistant's voice broke the tense silence, "You'll have ten minutes of unarmed combat. You may access the crates at the platform's edge when we give another signal. Be warned-most are empty decoys. Only one or two contain actual weapons. Remember, this is no mere contest. It's a fight for your very survival and your only chance to break free from Mariano's iron grip."  
Josh and I exchanged glances. I didn't know what he was thinking, but there was a strong possibility he was reading my mind.  
Sarah mentioned that Josh is a doctor. But as an experienced businessman, I read people, too. I took pride in my knack for understanding people and discovering their hidden motivations and weaknesses.  
I cast a final, meaningful glance at Orlie before plunging into the churning sea. The shock of cold water jolted my senses as I swam forcefully toward the Viper Turf War platform. As I got closer, I felt the hydrofoam block moving unpredictably with the waves, making me dizzy.  
Pulling myself onto the platform, my lungs burned, and my chest heaved. I struggled to catch my breath before standing, my legs adjusting instinctively to the unsteady surface. My eyes darted around, searching for any clue where a weapon might be hidden.  
A spotlight suddenly focused on me, momentarily blinding me.  
'Just great!'  
Moments later, Josh hauled himself onto the Viper Turf War. At precisely seven o'clock in the evening, Mariano's assistant fired a gunshot into the air, signaling the start of battle.  
Josh and I positioned ourselves to strategize, our movements heavy but deliberate on the unstable surface-every step required concentration to maintain balance.  
"Come on, Philip! We both know you're here to kill me!" Josh taunted.  
"You're damn right," I growled, launching into action with a powerful kick aimed at his midsection. Josh managed to deflect it partially, retaliating with a swift jab that glanced off my cheekbone.  
We traded blows furiously, each impact echoing the crash of waves around us. The constant motion of the platform added an extra layer of challenge, forcing us to fight each other and maintain our footing.  
Josh grabbed my arms, attempting to wrench them behind my back. "Once you're dead," he hissed, "I'll marry Sarah. Your children will be mine!"  
His words ignited a primal rage within me. Roaring, "In your fucking dreams!"  
I broke free, tackled him onto the uneven foam surface, and started punching relentlessly. Each punch hit hard, my fists connecting firmly with his face. The sound of my knuckles against his flesh echoed over the waves, mixed with his painful grunts. Determined, I kept striking, focusing solely on the satisfying impact of each blow.  
"I'll make damn sure," I panted between blows, "that I will never see you again, you fucking bastard!"
###chapter 127: Viper Turf War 2 
**Philip**  
Josh saw an opening and swung his legs upward, crossing them over my neck in a desperate attempt to break free. Suddenly, the ten-minute signal blared-it was time to find the hidden knife. My fists were already bloody, but I had to act quickly.  
With a powerful thrust of his legs, Josh flipped me over, and we tumbled across the foam surface. The battleground shifted violently as a massive wave surged over us, knocking us both down. After ten minutes of relentless struggle, my internal organs screamed in pain.  
"Fuck you, Philip! Fuck you for hurting Sarah!" Josh shouted, pounding my body with brutal force.  
His words cut deep, but I had to stay focused. I knew my wrongdoings, but my wife had already forgiven me. "Your words don't matter anymore! You're just a pathetic fool trying to take what's mine!"  
Josh crawled towards a crate on the side, struggling to open it while lying downward. Empty!  
I seized the opportunity and kicked his back repeatedly in desperation. He rolled away, dodging my foot, and countered with a powerful kick to my chest.  
Josh's strength was overwhelming, and I felt the force of every blow. The fight was brutal; I tasted my own blood as he punched my face, and I kicked back in retaliation.  
Both of us were panting, drenched in sweat, and utterly exhausted, yet we pushed on, determined to finish the fight.  
In a vicious move, Josh grabbed my hair and shoved my face into the salty water, pinning my body against the foam platform. Panic surged through me as water filled my mouth and nostrils.  
"I fell in love with Sarah! I'll fuck her once you're dead!" he spat, his intentions clear. He planned to drown me, knowing we had opened half the crates without finding the knife.  
I struggled against his grip, my vision blurring as the lack of oxygen took its toll.  
Bubbles escaped my lips as my lungs strained for air. I fight against his suffocating grip, desperate to break free and prevent my head from being forced underwater.  
Under the bright spotlight, I noticed a glimmer-a silver knife resting in a crate next to me, submerged and ready. With determination, I grabbed it, feeling its cold metal in my hand. Quickly, I slashed at Josh's hand, the cut deep enough to make him let go of my tangled hair.  
A gasp tore from my throat, loud and ragged, as I gulped in precious air. Teeth clenched, I lashed out in frustration, kicking at him with all the force I could muster.  
"Ahhhh!" My scream pierced the dark night, a mix of fury and exhaustion.  
We square off again in the middle of the sea, his gaze fixed on the gleaming knife gripped tightly in my shaking hand.  
He growled fiercely as he approached. I swiftly ducked under his attack, sliding beneath his defenses. The knife struck, cutting into his legs, blood spurting from his wounds.  
The sea churned violently and threatened our balances. Josh saw his chance and kicked my hand. The knife slipped from my grasp, tumbling into the hydrofoam platform! We fight for it, our fingers tangled in a desperate struggle to gain control.  
Soon, the Viper Turf War is stained crimson with blood.  
"Ahhhh!"  
With determination, Josh struck back, the knife flashing dangerously close to my shoulder. Pain shot through me as the blade grazed my palm. I reacted instantly, elbowing his jaw and gritting my teeth against the pain.  
We huffed  
Exhaustion filled the space between us, the weight of fatigue pressing down on us. In a rare moment of clear thinking, I seized my opportunity and drove the knife deep into Josh's shoulder, close to his chest.  
We stood on the edge of the battlefield, poised for action. Digging deep for one final burst of energy, I delivered a powerful kick to his neck, sending him sprawling into the sea, far from the turmoil of the Viper Turf War. Dizziness blurred my vision, but I stayed alert, ready for any hint of his return.  
The pain from his deep cuts surged through me, every breath a battle against the creeping darkness.  
I glanced right, then left, as darkness crept into my vision. Soon, I lost consciousness.  
Or maybe... was I dead?  
***  
**Sarah**  
After Philip called me tonight, I couldn't calm my nerves down. It brought back memories of my conversation with Amir.  
Today is Madam Cornell's final farewell, a solemn event my husband's mysterious absence made more complicated. Despite everything, I still believe Philip chose me, but I can't shake the worry-did recent events hurt him more than he showed?  
I find myself questioning if Philip could betray me again. My hands shook as I dialed Jane's number, hoping for answers.  
"Hi," Jane's voice sounded tired, heavy with exhaustion.  
"Love, are you still at the office?" I asked, injecting warmth into my tone to mask my anxiety.  
"Yes. Remember the SciFi project? Unfortunately, I've been assigned as its producer. Dad transferred the responsibility to me."  
I hadn't been aware of this development. Jane hadn't visited Serenity Pines in months, and I'd noticed a growing distance between us, unlike our closer bond in the past. Yet, I hoped it was merely my perception, considering she was still in therapy.  
Jane continued, "Philip asked if I could join the family at the cemetery for his mom's burial, but I declined. I... I chose to work overtime instead."  
"Oh, I see," I murmured, processing this information. "Please, do try to visit soon. I miss you dearly, Jane," I expressed warmly.  
"I miss you too, Sarah!" Her voice perked up. "By the way, I heard from Philip's bodyguard that Josh has quit?"  
"Yes," I replied shortly, wanting to change the subject from Josh, which was still sensitive. "Um, could you do me a favor? Can you check on Philip's office? I just want to ensure everything's okay, especially since today is Madam Cornell's burial."  
"Sure thing!"  
Philip and Jane's office were in the same building, so it was convenient for Jane to inform me about my husband's whereabouts.  
As I sipped milk in the kitchen, another call came in from Jane.  
"Hey, love! Brother Philip's private office is closed. I saw Assistant Alex and noticed he was uneasy. Just as I was about to approach him, he received a call and hurriedly left. I didn't get a chance to talk to him."  
My heart pounded. Something was definitely wrong; I could sense it deeply. I had felt tension during Philip's earlier call. Now, those suspicions rushed back to me. However, I chose to keep quiet, aware of Jane's fragile state during therapy.  
"Maybe your brother met a business partner outside the office, and then he called Alex to resolve some issues possibly... Anyway, it was lovely catching up. Take care of yourself, bestie!"  
The moment I hung up, my fingers flew across my phone's keyboard:  
Me: Log in to our secure channel NOW. I need your expertise ASAP!  
From the kitchen, I planned to head to the computer room to talk to Jakob. Passing through the living room, I glanced outside the villa's floor-to-ceiling window. It seemed like my guards were on high alert, murmuring to each other.  
I saw Trey stationed outside the door. My anxiety heightened. Instead of hesitating, I went to the door and flung it open.  
Trey quickly turned at the sound, sensing my presence, and turned to look at me.  
"What's going on, Trey?" I asked, my voice shaking slightly despite my attempt to stay calm.  
He swallowed.  
"Philip told me he had something to do at the office, but I spoke to Jane, and she said my husband wasn't there. What's happening?"  
Trey took a step towards me. But before the bodyguard could utter a word, the main gate opened, and Ethan's emergency car pulled in from the hospital. It screeched to a halt in front of the villa's grand entrance. The back doors flew open, and a team in scrubs began unloading an array of sophisticated medical equipment.  
My blood ran cold. "W-where's Philip?" I stammered.  
"He's on his way!" Ethan replied, then began giving instructions.  
Ethan's medical team hurried in, pushing carts filled with advanced equipment. They headed straight for the east wing-the same room where Philip had recovered from his coma months ago. My stomach twisted into knots.  
"Damn it! Can someone answer me? Where is Philip?" I shouted, my voice trembling with fear and frustration. The staff flinched, exchanging nervous glances.  
Ethan motioned for his team to continue their work, then approached me. He gently took my trembling hands in his.  
"Sarah, one thing's for sure: your husband is alive. Just like when he was in a coma, we can't risk keeping him at the hospital. The media would swarm in no time. That's why we're setting up here."  
His words didn't calm the rising panic in my chest.  
Before I could demand more answers, I heard a helicopter approaching. He finalized our conversation. "Sarah, I know you have many questions, but your husband needed me."  
Ethan spun around and ran towards the improvised landing area on the expansive lawn. The helicopter descended, swirling up a storm of grass and leaves. As soon as it landed, the door burst open.  
Trembling in fear, unsure of what had transpired, all that was evident was Philip's wetsuit, torn by knives. Dark, wet stains covered the white sheets beneath him, and I realized in horror that it was his blood.  
Tears streamed down my face as I watched them quickly take my husband away.
###chapter 128: Clinical Chamber 
**Sarah** 

A few hours had passed since I last spoke with Philip on the phone. Now, he returned, but unconscious and covered in blood. Panic surged through me as I followed Ethan's group to the room where my husband was being taken, but I was stopped at the door. 
"Sarah, trust me on this. It's better if you stay outside for now," said Ethan before closing the door. 
It was then that I noticed Philip's assistant, who looked at me sadly. In his hands was a paper bag, grease stains showing what was inside-just the buns I'd asked Philip to bring home. 
Tears spilled down my cheeks as I turned to Alex, my voice trembling and frantic, eager to get answers. "What happened, Alex? Why is my husband covered in blood? Did something happen to him? Where did Philip go?"  
Alex took a deep breath, visibly burdened by what he was about to say. He briefly removed his glasses, rubbed the bridge of his nose, and then looked me straight in the eye. 
"He's doing this for you, Madam Sarah. He did this to leave Mariano's group." 
The name sent a chill down my spine. Mariano. Again! 
"I don't know how much you're aware of: Josh was allowed to leave and return to his normal life, which resulted in questions from some of Mariano's advisors and men. Boss Philip disagreed that Josh would leave without consequences." 
Alex paused, swallowing hard before continuing. "The punishment is usually not a joke, especially since Josh's request was to leave Mariano's team-it often results in death to protect the secrets." 
Anxiously, I awaited Alex's following words. My thoughts were split: one part was trying to process this information, to understand the web of danger Philip had been entangled in, while the other remained fixed on the closed door where Ethan fought to save my husband's life. 
"Boss Philip expressed his desire to leave the group as well... Ever since that day when Mariano's men chased you on your return to Dubai, Boss Philip has been looking for a way out. Your safety became his priority, especially now with the pregnancy." 
My hand instinctively moved to my stomach.  
"Mariano agreed to the boss's request but had to contend with Josh." 
I gasped. 
"Boss Philip brought up the issue deliberately in this meeting to prevent Mariano from refusing. He ensured Mariano's key people were present as witnesses to prevent any changes to the agreement and to show he wasn't receiving special treatment. They agreed to physical confrontation. Only the survivor would be allowed to leave." 
My lips trembled at the news. "You... You mean..." 
Assistant Alex nodded. "Yes, Madam Sarah! Josh is dead." 
'Oh, my God!' My eyes widened in shock. 
Alex refrained from saying more, knowing how close I was to Josh. Philip's bodyguard had been a great support to me, which made me cry even harder. I couldn't believe Philip had gone through this to break free from Mariano's grip. 
Why did it have to come to this? With Josh gone, now Philip's life was also at risk. 
"Where... where is Josh now?" I managed to ask through my tears. 
"Mariano's group is handling the arrangements Madam Sarah, please... You also need to take care of yourself," Alex pleaded. 
I nodded numbly, knowing he was right. It would be a waste of their efforts if I didn't care for myself. Just months ago, all I had dreamed of was starting a family, but I never imagined facing such trials first. 
My phone rang, showing Jakob's number. He might already be waiting for our meeting link because I messaged him earlier to talk. 
I declined the call, sending a quick message instead: 
***Me:*** *'I'm sorry, Jake. I already know what happened. This isn't the right time to talk.'* 
***Jakob:*** *'Is everything okay?'* 
My fingers shook as I typed: *'No. Philip is receiving treatment, and I'm not okay.'* 
***Jakob:*** *'Call me when you're ready. I want to hear what happened.'* 
I left his message unanswered, my attention drawn back to the closed door where Ethan worked to save my husband.  
Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself. Questions whirled in my mind, but I pushed them aside. Philip's survival was all that mattered now.  
Hours dragged on as I waited outside the makeshift operating room, each passing second stretching into eternity. Finally, Ethan emerged. 
"Sarah, I understand this is a challenging moment," Ethan spoke softly. "I've tended to most of his wounds, but I can't let you in yet. We need to keep the environment sterile to minimize infection risk. Only my medical team is allowed inside for now." 
Ethan seemed to notice my reddened eyes. He stepped forward and enveloped me in a comforting embrace. "I know you're desperate to be by his side," he murmured. "I promise I'll let you know when you can see him, alright?" 
I nodded against his shoulder as he gently led me towards the master bedroom, Alex silently following behind us. 
"Philip is stable for now," he assured me. "But Sarah, you need to take care of yourself too. It's not just Philip who needs you." His eyes flickered briefly to my round belly. "Remember, two others are depending on you now." 
I nodded again, momentarily forgetting about the twins waiting for me. 
"Please, take some rest I won't let you stress yourself to the point of harm," Ethan urged. 
Lying down on the bed, I endeavored to regain composure, holding back tears. Ethan knew about my history of panic attacks and shallow breathing. Despite months passing since my last episode, when my vision blurred and breathing became shallow, I still needed to calm myself down. 
*** 
The morning sun's warm rays filtered through the slightly open balcony door, waking me gently. 
Suddenly, a jolt of realization hit me. "Philip!" 
I stood up suddenly with my heart racing. My eyes adjusted to recognize the familiar master bedroom around me. Quickly, I grabbed the soft robe hanging on the nearby chair. I quickly tied the robe with shaking hands and rushed down the hallway. The house was eerily silent, making my rapid breathing seem louder. 
As I approached Philip's room, I noticed a different guard standing watch outside, suggesting Assistant Alex and Ethan had likely gone home to rest. 
"How's your boss?" I asked the guard. 
The guard's expression stayed blank, revealing nothing. Before he could respond, the door opened with a soft click. A woman in pale blue scrubs emerged. 
"Can I see Philip now?" I asked eagerly. 
Though a surgical mask covered half her face, I could see the corners of her eyes crinkle with a reassuring smile.  
"You can go in, Ms. Mitchell," she replied. 
Entering the room, I found Philip propped up in bed. Our gazes locked, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. He looked better than I had feared-perhaps Alex, indeed, was a skilled surgeon. A clear IV bag hung next to the bed, with a thin tube running down under a bandage on his arm. 
"You idiot!" I scolded, and my voice broke as tears threatened to spill over. 
He smiled softly. "Come here," he said, his voice slightly hoarse. 
Sniffling, I approached and sat on the edge of the bed. 
"I'm sorry if I worried you," Philip said, reaching out to gently caress my rounded belly.  
Frustrated, I slapped his shoulder.  
"Ow!" he hissed, wincing slightly. 
"Sorry! I'm annoyed that you made a deal with Mariano instead of prioritizing your life. What if..." My words stuck in my throat, unable to express the terrifying thought that had plagued me all night. 
Philip looked pained. "I know, babe. I know what I did was wrong. Please forgive me..." 
I took a deep breath, preparing myself for the question that had been bothering me. "What about Josh?" 
Philip's eyebrow quirked upward. 
"I know you're jealous of him, Philip, but it's not right for him to die because of me. You should have let him go." 
"I know, I'm sorry... But Josh wasn't a good man either, Sarah. He said he'd fuck you and would take our children. It's no excuse, but he insulted you, and that's not acceptable." 
A heavy silence fell between us. 
"I almost thought I was the one who was dead," Philip continued after a moment. He brought my hand to his lips, pressing a gentle kiss against my knuckles. "Now, I'm free, Sarah... I will be your servant from now on." 
Leaning carefully against Philip's side, mindful of his injuries, the steady rhythm of his heartbeat beneath my ear became the most beautiful sound in the world.  
Suddenly, a knock on the door interrupted the silent room. 
"M-Madam Sarah, you've got a visitor. Your grandfather and Mr. Benner's car are outside." 
Oh, shit!
###chapter 129: Unseen Enemy 
**Philip** 

Holding Sarah close, I tried to ignore the searing pain from the knife wounds scattered across my body. Her warmth revitalized me, almost as if her presence alone could heal my injuries. I gently touched her belly, my fingers spreading out as if I could feel the new life growing inside. 
A pang of guilt about Josh flashed through my mind, but that's just the harsh reality of our world, the one I need to leave behind.  
As my fingers roamed over her skin, my wife and I seemed to be on the same wavelength. 
"I can't believe Josh is gone. You should have let him be, Philip," Sarah repeated, her voice tinged with sorrow. 
I lifted her face and kissed her passionately, pouring all my emotions into that mind-blowing, toe-curling, cum-inducing kiss she deserved. When we finally parted, Sarah looked dazed, her lips slightly swollen and her cheeks flushed. 
"I've already told you, haven't I? I hate it when you think about other men." 
Sarah frowned. "You're impossible, Philip!" 
I sneered. "Anyway, I'm just a bit bothered by Josh." 
"Tss! A bit? Your actions scream otherwise!" she said, shaking her head. "You and your-" 
"SDE!" I interjected, completing her sentence, finally understanding what it meant. 
Her giggle was like music to my ears. I couldn't help but smile, drinking in the sight of her-hair tousled, eyes bright with a mix of emotions. I leaned in for another kiss, this one slower, more tender. My tongue traced the curve of her lips before delving deeper, tasting, exploring.  
I didn't even notice the blood spurting from my shoulder because all I wanted was her presence, her scent, oblivious to the pain screaming from different parts of my body. 
"Oh God, Philip! You're bleeding!" She jerked back, her eyes wide with horror, staring at the reddened gauze on my shoulder. 
"Geez, I won't faint from a panic attack, Philip; I'll faint from the blood!" she murmured, her face adorably flushed in the sunlight. I wanted to live forever with this woman. I couldn't wait to see the babies growing inside her, my hand caressing her belly at the thought. 
"It's not as bad as it looks," I lied. 
"I need to call the medical staff right now. Dr. Ethan will definitely scold me!" 
The names she mentioned earlier were unimportant compared to her and the precious life she carried. 
"Shhh," I whispered, gently silencing her worried rambling. "Just let me hold you for a moment, babe." 
My words caused Sarah's body to relax against mine, sensing my presence as if it were my own. I wanted to stay in this peaceful bubble, but fate had different plans. 
Loud, persistent knocking shattered our peaceful moment. Each bang on the thick door carried urgency, making me tense. 
One of my guards spoke clearly: "M-Madam Sarah, you have a visitor. Your grandfather and Mr. Benner's car are outside." 
Sarah's eyes widened in panic. "Ohhh, shit!"  
Clearly flustered, she exclaimed, "My God! Of all days, why now?" My wife sighed. "I don't know how I will explain to Grandpa Mitchell that you're recovering, Philip! The medical equipment, your injuries... there'll be many questions!" 
I remained composed outwardly, but inside, I was distraught. The simultaneous arrival of both Amir and Grandpa Mitchell heightened my suspicions. Could Mariano be checking to confirm my survival? 
Nervously, Sarah said, "I-I'll face them, love," as she got off the bed. "I'll tell them you had an accident during car racing practice. That should cover it, right?" 
Wincing at her hurried movements, I cautioned, "Careful, Sarah!" eyeing her swollen belly with concern.  
Sometimes, I wondered if she forgot she was pregnant. She seemed so carefree. 
Sarah exited, leaving me alone with my thoughts and suspicions. Time crawled before the door swung open again. Grandpa Mitchell and Amir entered first, trailed by my visibly anxious wife and a couple of vigilant guards stationed at the doorway. 
Their scrutinizing gazes scanned over me, noticing the IV drip and my bandaged wounds. Before they could say a word, I took charge of the conversation. 
"Grandpa Mitchell," I began, "I apologize for not being able to return to Dubai. I've been recuperating for months and have been immediately confronted with office issues and my mother's situation. Please understand it doesn't reflect my lack of respect for you." 
Sarah forced a laugh. "See? We've had some issues so that we couldn't visit you! He takes care of me, grandfather." Her eyes shifted nervously between me and the elderly man, silently seeking understanding. 
The elderly man didn't acknowledge Sarah's comment. "I heard you acquired a significant stake in the petroleum business in Venezuela." 
My wife's brow furrowed. "Petroleum business?" before glancing at me. 
Grandpa Mitchell clarified, "Your husband bought 10% of PetroVeneza Energy Corporation last year." 
"The company that had financial troubles last year? The one all over the financial news?" Sarah asked. 
"Precisely," the old man nodded. "While the company lost money, your husband increased his stake to 50%. Their CEO made a series of terrible decisions over three years, causing the stock to plummet. Philip then bought a controlling interest of 60%. He revamped the marketing strategy, and the company bounced back remarkably with the recent rise in global oil prices. Within months, they were earning far more than anyone had expected." 
I listened intently, understanding every word, but I struggled to discern the purpose behind this unexpected visit and impromptu business lecture. 
"Wow, love!" Sarah forgot her earlier nervousness. "You're not just rich; you're incredibly wealthy! I married a loaded man!" she exclaimed proudly. 
The old man grew contemplative before making a request, "Can you all please leave Philip and me alone?" 
A surge of nervousness swept over me. Grandpa Mitchell's detailed knowledge of my business dealings raised questions about his true identity. Could he possibly be Mariano? 
Amir's eyes narrowed as he turned to Sarah. "You and I need to talk, too." 
"Yeah, yeah. Why are you being so snarky?" Sarah retorted, visibly annoyed, delivering her trump card. "Careful with your words-I'm pregnant." 
Amir frowned. Soon after, everyone started to leave. Sarah shot me an apologetic glance before trailing after her brother, and then the door closed. 
I faced Grandpa Mitchell's gray eyes. They seemed to bore into me as if trying to read my very thoughts. 
He began, "I don't trust you because of your past actions toward my granddaughter, but I've spoken with Sarah, and despite my reservations, she seems genuinely happy Whatever I think doesn't matter anymore" 
I wait for him to continue. 
"You're making quite a name for yourself in the business world, but what I want-what I need-is for you to take care of my Sarah." 
His words softened my defenses. Despite our differences, we both shared the same goal. 
"She has overcome more challenges than you know to reach where she is now. Please, love and take care of my granddaughter..." 
I sincerely replied, "You can count on me, Grandpa Mitchell. I'm doing everything in my power for Sarah." 
As I spoke, I noticed a strange gleam in his eyes. Taking a deep breath, I decided to address my suspicion directly. 
"But I need to know the truth. Are you Mariano?" 
*** 

**Sarah** 

Two long months have passed since that frightening incident, and I still carry the heavy burden of guilt over what happened to Josh. 
Despite the time passing, I stayed watchful and focused on Lila's every move. Once the babies arrive, I can confront Lila without the concern of endangering my unborn children. 
I was occupied with various tasks when Jakob called me. 
"Sarah, you're on social media outlets and porn sites!" Jakob's voice was urgent and frantic.  
"What? What do you mean?" Porn sites? Is he serious? At 32 weeks pregnant, this feels like a ridiculous joke.  
"I sent you the link. Check it now!"  
Holding my phone, I quickly opened the link Jakob had sent. A video started playing. My eyes widened in horror as I recognized the scene. It was me and... Josh?  
A chill ran down my spine, and a wave of nausea swept over me as I watched myself on screen, engaged in a sexual act with a man who had passed away! 
"These have to be filters! Help me get them removed from those sites!" I demanded, my voice shaking with anger.  
"Um, the thing is, there's no sign that it's a filter, Sarah."  
My mouth fell open. What does that even mean? How could this be happening?
###chapter 130: Bound by Trust 
**Sarah**  
"Jakob, that's impossible!" I exclaimed, clutching my forehead as a headache started to form from what my friend had just told me. The room seemed to spin as I tried to process his words. "I have no relationship with Josh! I don't even see him that way!"  
I started to pace frantically across the marble floor. My strongest connection with Josh is our friendship, but it's nowhere near as close as what I share with Jakob or Jane.  
A sharp pain shot through my lower back, and my stomach twisted painfully. I placed a hand on my swollen belly, trying to soothe both myself and the babies inside me.  
"No, Sarah. I'm not kidding," Jakob replied, his tone serious.  
Sinking onto the plush sofa, legs suddenly weak, "You mean there's no filter on the video? You realize I'm pregnant, right? Besides, Josh is dead!" My voice wavered with concern.  
"Oh, right! But look at the date on the video. It says it was captured months ago. It's possible your belly wasn't showing yet, and Josh was still alive. Also, isn't that in Serenity Pines where you and Philip live?" he asked.  
His words sank in, making me tremble. The background did resemble our living space in Serenity Pines.  
"Please... Please do whatever it takes to remove those videos from the internet! I..." I exhaled heavily, feeling utterly lost and overwhelmed.  
"Don't worry," Jakob assured me, "Before you even asked, I've been working on it. I'm doing everything I can to take them down. If any issues arise, we'll assert they are all merely camera tricks. There will be no trace left, I promise. I'll ask Lexi to help speed things up."  
Despite not entirely calming my nerves, I appreciated Jakob and our team's support.  
After ending the call, I sat in stunned silence for several long moments, my mind racing, before dialing Philip's number.  
"Hello..." Philip's voice was emotionless when he answered. My heart clenched, uncertain if he had seen the video or not. Either way, we needed to talk about this immediately.  
"Philip, c-can you come home? I need to talk to you. It's urgent!" I said, my voice trembling.  
It took a moment before he responded.  
"My family saw your video with Josh," he muttered. "It was Alex who alerted me about it."  
My heart sank. "Philip, it wasn't me! Please, you have to believe me!" I pleaded, my voice filled with alarm. Suddenly, a sharp movement in my belly made me gasp-one of the twins had kicked strongly as if feeling my distress.  
My husband's deep, tired sigh came through the earpiece.  
"Philip..."  
"Sarah, I trust you. You don't have to worry about me. I don't care about what my relatives or anyone else say. Their words don't matter to me It's just that"  
"What is it?"  
"Aside from being furious about this whole situation, I'm worried about the consequences," Philip admitted. "And I hate that I had to see that... that sex tape!"  
I winced at his words, understanding how upsetting it must be for him to see his wife in such an intimate act with a bodyguard.  
"It's not me!" Tears threatened to spill. What about my future? What about my children if they ever see it?  
Frantically pacing around the room, one hand pressed against my lower back, the other cradling my swollen belly, I told myself, 'Sarah, calm down! You need to think clearly!'  
"I'm here!" I struggled to grasp Philip's meaning. Before I could make sense of his words, the familiar sound of his car pulling up at the front of Serenity Pines Estate interrupted my thoughts.  
Hurrying out, I reached the foyer just as Philip entered the villa.  
"Calm down" he muttered, frowning. His gaze swept over the living space-the very setting of the damning video now circulating online. I watched his face intently, searching for any hint that he genuinely believed in my innocence.  
Philip's jaw tightened, his fist clenched at his side. I could see the conflict in his expression as he wrestled between trusting me and the sex tape.  
"I won't sit idly by. I need to prove I'm innocent!" I declared, feeling the baby kick in my stomach. Instinctively, I cradled my swollen belly. Damn it! The news only made me feel worse.  
Philip's arms suddenly cradled me. I scolded him immediately. "Hey! Your shoulder wound isn't healed yet!"  
Philip's shoulder still throbbed from the deep wound. The weight on my heart grew heavier. We sat on the couch, his arms around me.  
I began to explain, "Philip, Jakob said the video had no trace of a filter... H-how did that happen? I didn't sleep with Josh! I'm not crazy enough to do that!"  
"Shh," he soothed, his calloused hand warm against my cheek as he stroked it gently. "I know it's not you, Sarah. Does that help calm you down?" Philip asked.  
I nodded, placing my hand on my chest as if trying to dispel the breath caught in my lungs. "I just... I can't understand how my face ended up in that video. It doesn't make sense to me."  
Philip rested his face on my shoulder, his stubble softly scratching my skin while his warm breath tickled my neck. His familiar scent surrounded me.  
"When I first saw it, I was livid," he admitted, "I actually broke the crystal paperweight Jane gave me last Christmas. I shattered it right there in the office."  
Softly, a gasp escaped me, attempting to ease the discomfort inside me.  
Philip continued, "But once I calmed down, I figured it must be a sophisticated filter or incredibly skilled makeup work. And yet..." His voice trailed off, confusion crossing his face.  
"What is it?" I interjected.  
He looked into my eyes once more, his brow creased in concentration. "During my mother's funeral procession, I could have sworn I saw you there, standing beside an oak tree, just... observing me. It unsettled me so deeply that I called you immediately."  
I furrowed my brow at his words. "What? That's impossible, Philip! I haven't set foot outside the Serenity Pines Estate gates in months. Even if I wanted to shop, dine out, or go on a date with you, I couldn't. I've been here keeping my pregnancy a secret!"  
"I know, love," he said soothingly, "I had forgotten about that incident until now. But remembering it, especially after seeing this video, it seems like someone has been playing a complex, twisted game with us."  
A chill ran down my spine, causing me to shiver despite the warmth of Philip's embrace. "Are you suggesting that I might have a look-alike out there? And what about that replica of Serenity Pines in the video? How could anyone recreate our home so perfectly?"  
I didn't dare speak aloud, but watching that sex tape, even I would be convinced it was me.  
Trembling, a mixture of anger and fear coursed through me. Instinctively, a protective hand went over my belly, trying to soothe our unborn children.  
Philip spoke sharply, "I suspect Josh might be involved with that woman. He's the only other person familiar with Serenity Pines' layout. This could be his attempt to drive a wedge between us."  
His words stung, yet I couldn't dismiss his suspicion. Josh knew the estate very well and was also in the video.  
"Are you certain you trust that it's not me in the video?"  
He smirked, "Sarah, it's amusing, but I know anything about you. I recognize your moans and your body, even in the dark. You're not her. And her cunt wasn't as appealing either."  
"You studied her that closely?" I asked incredulously, shaking my head in disbelief.  
"Women differ in size and color down there. I know your body well, even your fingertips."  
I didn't know whether to feel proud or flabbergasted-I chose the last and left speechless.  
"But who is that woman, Philip?" I asked, curiosity overriding my discomfort.  
Before he could answer, his brow furrowed in concern. He glanced down at his leg where I was sitting.  
"Oh my God, Philip!" I cried out, gripping his shoulder as pain seared through my hips. Damn it, it couldn't be time yet.  
"Ahhh!" My scream echoed through the house.  
Forget Josh, Serenity Pines, or the mysterious video! "I... I think I'm going into labor!"  
The door burst open as alarmed guards rushed in.  
"Boss?"  
"Quickly! Prepare the car and call Ethan-it's an emergency!" he ordered urgently, scooping me up and rushing out the door.
###chapter 131: Non-Contractual Love 
**Emily** 

Lost in thought, I remembered the day Bronn tried to convince me to move to Henderson with Willow. It was months ago... 
My phone buzzed with a message from Bronn: 
Bronn: 'Emily, why are you turning down my offer? This isn't just about us, and it's for Willow. We'll get along so our daughter can have the complete family she deserves. We'll let the public know slowly, but I really want to keep this quiet for now so Willow doesn't get hounded by paparazzi and gossip columnists.' 
A tickle in my nose preceded a sudden sneeze. The bright screen of my phone seemed to pierce my already strained eyes, so I set it aside. 
Not a single thing Bronn said made me happy. I allowed him to visit our child; I think he already won her over-with nothing more than a clubhouse sandwich! Tss! 
But I can't agree with Bronn; his contract offer felt like poison to me. He can be a father to Willow without involving me or making me his wife. I didn't even read the content in the contract because I was so pissed. 
"Ms. Emily, are you feeling alright?" Sophia's voice interrupted my chaotic thoughts. She was one of Sarah's new assistants, a capable woman in her mid-thirties. 
Just then, our meeting partner re-entered the small conference room. The realtor, a well-dressed woman in her fifties with an efficient demeanor, handed me the signed document. I reviewed it, but a thin layer of tears clouded my vision. Quickly grabbing a tissue, I wiped them away. 
"Are you alright, Ms. Carter?" the realtor inquired. We met here in Sweet Valley, just a few hours from Highland Hills. 
"Yes, I'm terribly sorry for the distraction," I managed, forcing a smile. I turned to Sophia, "Please review the documents. We must ensure all required signatures are present and every minute detail has been properly signed." 
She nodded and went through the documents one by one. It was challenging to go back to save our time here. Even a single missing signature would be a huge problem. There needed to be more than an electronic signature since the document related to properties and real estate. 
"I feel like you're going to get sick," the lady remarked. "Ms. Mitchell is lucky to have someone like you." 
"Thank you for your kind observation," I replied, striving to stay professional. "Working with Ms. Mitchell is truly an honor." 
My smile remained fixed. Sarah's offer to lead Sophia and Mike after promoting me was anything but ordinary. The salary alone was impressive, and on top of that, there was the apartment, car, and the option to work from home while handling her meetings schedule and video conferences.  
It was a package that would make any executive assistant jealous. The compensation was so competitive that it seemed almost unbelievable for someone like me. 
"Ms. Mitchell's new office in Highland Hills has just opened," I said, my voice slightly hoarse. "Our team is busy setting up and transitioning." 
I sniffled again, feeling my nose tickle and my sinuses grow heavy. My throat felt rough like I'd swallowed sandpaper. 
"Ms. Emily," Sophia interjected, "I've thoroughly reviewed all the documents. Everything appears to be in order and properly signed." 
"Thank you so much, Madam!" Our transaction concluded smoothly. 
In the elevator, I rubbed my gritty, sore eyes. 
Sophia sounded concerned. "Ms. Emily, maybe you should rest. You don't look well." 
I nodded, feeling a wave of fatigue wash over me. "You're right. I'll call Sarah after this to inform her that I'm not feeling my best. Would you mind driving us back?" 
Hesitating slightly, I held out the car keys. Sarah had entrusted the vehicle to me, and I took that responsibility. But given how I was feeling, letting Sophia drive seemed the safer option to avoid any potential accidents. 
During our journey, I texted Sarah: 
Me: 'I'll let Sophia drive. I'm not feeling well and think I'm coming down with the flu.' 
Once we were on the road, Sophia broke the silence with a question that had clearly been on her mind. 
"Ms. Emily, isn't Ms. Mitchell based in Highland Hills? It seems odd that she hasn't met me and Mike in person yet." Sophia asked. Glancing at Sophia, her sharp observational skills came to mind. 
Truthfully, I had been wondering the same thing. Sarah has rarely left Serenity Pines since Madam Cornell's arrest. I thought the incident had affected her more than she showed. 
"Our boss is currently undergoing therapy," I explained carefully, aware of the need for discretion. "There have been... threats to her safety. Do you remember the incident on The Oceanic Odyssey cruise ship? Sarah's family was directly involved. But please, don't share this with anyone," I cautioned her. 
Sophia shrugged. "I just can't believe it! She's what, twenty-three? Sometimes it feels like our boss spends her time shopping and living off her wealth, relying on us for everything just because she's young." 
"You need to observe your words, Sophia. Sarah's life choices are hers, and it's not your place to interfere. Your relationship with her is strictly professional-she pays you to work, and that's the extent of it." 
Sophia shrugged. 
I became more cautious of Sophia. At early thirties, she was the oldest among us, and I frequently heard her asking Mike about our ages. It seemed like she was always trying to get ahead, using her seniority to gain an advantage over us younger employees. Her ambition was clear, but her approach bothered me. 
"Keep this in mind, Sophia. Sarah may be young, but that doesn't mean she's naïve or incompetent." 
Sarah wouldn't be raking in millions just by monitoring the stock market if she didn't know exactly what she was doing. Her success spoke volumes about her capabilities, regardless of her age. She's the Benner princess, not an ordinary woman. 
A heavy silence fell between Sophia and me as our vehicle cruised along the long highway back to Highland Hills.  
When we arrived at the office, Josh was waiting in the lobby. 
"Hi, Josh!" Sophia greeted him. I noticed Sophia trying to flirt with Sarah's bodyguard, but he remained as impassive as a wall, unaffected by her attempts. 
"Madam Sarah sent me to collect the documents," Josh stated flatly, pointedly ignoring Sophia's advances.  
"Is she alright?" I asked. A sudden sneeze escaped me, making me realize how awful I felt. "I haven't seen her for months." 
"I think you're the one who's not okay," he remarked before making suggestions. "Give me the car keys. I'll drive you to your apartment." 
"Thank you!" I didn't refuse because my eyes were already stinging, and my head felt heavy. 
"Can I come too?" Sophia asked with a flirtatious tone, trying to join our conversation. It was apparent she was trying to seduce Josh. 
Before I could respond, a newcomer appeared, snatching the keys from my hand with surprising speed.  
"I'll take her." It was Bronn; his forehead creased as he noticed my discomfort. He placed his palm on my forehead. 
My face contorted into a sour expression. I had no intention of discussing the contract with Bronn again, but I was too exhausted to protest. Besides, I didn't want to trouble Josh for a ride, and Willow would be delighted to see her dad.  
I got into the car, leaving Sophia and Josh standing on the side of the road. 
Inside the car, the quiet engine and the comfortable leather seat made me feel sleepy. I'm not sure what happened next. One moment, I struggled to stay awake, and the next, I drifted into complete darkness. 
The next thing I knew of was being guided by strong, steady arms into the apartment.  
My vision blurred, and my legs weakened, slipping into a relentless cycle of darkness and unconsciousness.  
I was enveloped in a chill 
I needed a thick fleece or comforter desperately  
I was shivering with cold sweat, my clothes clinging uncomfortably to my skin 
When I regained consciousness, two familiar, strong arms embraced me warmly. 
Battling the flu, I spent a few days recovering.  
Bronn stayed in the apartment the whole time, caring for Willow and me. He is remarkably balanced as a nurse and father. I found out later that he had canceled all his plans for the week to prioritize being with us. 
He even postponed his trip to China to promote LoveLogic. 
As I started feeling better, I wanted to trust Bronn's care and commitment. But part of me hesitated, remembering our past issues. Eventually, I found the courage to confront the obvious. 
"I accept your offer for Willow and me to stay in Henderson, but not the marriage proposal, Bronn-I'm not just a business deal," I muttered. 
"What does that even mean?" Bronn asked. 
"It means I'm a woman, not a contractual lover." 
To my surprise, he acknowledged his mistakes. "Sarah already explained it to me," he admitted. "But can we at least be a family? I mean, Emily... I want you to be my... I want you to be my... I want us to be exclusive." 
Stunned, never in my wildest dreams had I expected Bronn to ask me to be his official partner. 
"We can work through this for now, and then we can decide if marriage is something we want to pursue." 
His request was so ordinary, almost like something out of a teenage romance, that it completely caught me off guard. After a moment of shocked silence, I found myself agreeing.  
I informed Sarah that I accepted Bronn, though she misunderstood, thinking it meant I accepted his marriage proposal.
###chapter 132: Double the Joy  
**Philip** 
Restless with nerves, I paced the hallway in the dim glow of midnight, unable to settle. Sarah had been in the labor room for what felt like an eternity, on the brink of delivering twins prematurely. 
The anxiety gripped me tight. The twins, still weeks from their due date, now necessitated an urgent C-section due to complications. The mere thought of Sarah undergoing surgery sent waves of unease through me. 
"Boss, it's Mr. Benner!" Alex said, snapping me out of my worried trance. 
Amir hurried over, his face etched with worry. I wasn't prepared to face him, my mind racing with many emotions. 
"Where's Sarah?" Amir demanded, his tone accusatory. 
Alex glanced at me, then back to Amir. "She's inside, Mr. Benner, undergoing a cesarean section." 
"What have you done?!" Amir's anger flared, seizing my collar with a fierce grip. 
"What did you do? Sarah shouldn't be giving birth yet! Did you stress her out about that video circulating online?" he accused fiercely.  
"Could you, please? Don't blame me-I didn't do anything! Yes, Sarah was stressed-who wouldn't be? But it wasn't because of me!" I retorted, pushing his hand away in frustration. 
Alex intervened, restraining Amir gently. "Mr. Benner, since the video came out, we've been working tirelessly to remove it and safeguard Madam Sarah's privacy. Dr. Vanderbilt confirmed that Madam could no longer carry the babies, but the procedure will ensure their safe delivery without complications." 
Amir released my collar; his expression clouded with concern. "Where's Josh? He's the only one who could have leaked that video!" 
"He's dead!" I blurted out, turning away in frustration. 
"What do you mean he's dead?" Amir asked, stunned. 
Amir was relentless. Couldn't he see I wasn't in the right frame of mind to talk? 
"Did you kill him?" His mouth hung open in suspicion. 
Alex cleared his throat. 
"Did Sarah cheat with him?" Amir pressed again. "Did you decide to eliminate your rival by removing him from your lives?" 
At this point, I struggled to contain my frustration with his relentless questioning. Yes, that's right! Part of me wanted to kill Josh! And if this goddamn brother-in-law of mine keeps pushing would be next! 
"First off, Sarah isn't the woman in it. So, if you're thinking my wife and I had a fight or that I suspected her of cheating, you're completely off base. Second, I'm doing everything I can to investigate the video." 
I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. 
"Lastly, can you please shut the fuck up?! Say one more word, and I'll ensure you're barred from Serenity Pines Estate. You won't see even a strand of my children's hair." 
Amir's eyes narrowed as my heart raced with irritation. Only the sound of a baby crying from the room calmed me momentarily. 
Damn it! I wasn't calm at all. Standing up abruptly, I felt at a loss for what to do next. Furthermore, I wasn't even sure if the baby's cries belonged to my twins.  
A medical staff member emerged from the wide door. "President Cornell, you can go in now." 
I rushed inside, hearing Amir complain behind me about why he couldn't come in. This hospital area is tightly regulated and situated in a separate building from the main one. Inside the maternity ward, there's a recovery area. I saw Sarah, the only patient in sight, through the large window. 
Sarah's hospital bed was slightly elevated, fatigue evident on her face as she kept her eyes closed. I longed to go to her side and check on her after her surgery. Worry consumed me, and I couldn't hold back the tears of fear and relief. 
"Philip!" Ethan's voice called out urgently. 
"Ethan! Is... is my wife okay?" I asked anxiously. 
"She'll be recovering for about six more hours. You should be able to talk to her properly tomorrow, considering she just had surgery." 
My chest ached with pain, a deep feeling that seemed to spread through my whole body. At that moment, I silently promised to every god I could think of: that I would forever protect and cherish Sarah, my beloved wife. She had sacrificed so much to bring our children into the world.  
Taking a deep breath to steady myself, I turned to Ethan. 
"Where are the babies?" I asked. 
His eyes crinkled at the corners, betraying his own emotional state despite the medical mask covering half his face. He guided me towards a corner of the room I hadn't noticed before-a small nursery. 
Through the transparent sides of a modern bassinet, I caught my first glimpse of two tiny forms. My breath caught, and a choked sob escaped me. Wrapped in soft blankets, there they lay-perfect little beings.  
Even from this distance, I knew without a doubt that these were my children. Something deep within me recognized them instantly. 
They were incredibly tiny, their delicate features slightly swollen from birth. Their little hands were tightly clenched into fists. Joy overwhelmed me. If only Sarah could share this moment. 
"Hello, my precious little ones," I whispered through sniffles. It was a happiness unlike any I had ever felt before. 
"Congratulations, brother! Damn! I never thought you'd start a family before me!" 
Before I could respond, Sarah's doctor entered the room. Like Ethan, she wore a surgical mask. "Congratulations, President Cornell. You can hold the twins briefly if you'd like. It's good for them to have that early contact." 
Despite the temptation to cradle my newborns, I shook my head. "Please, let my wife have that privilege," I insisted. 
I should have given Sarah the opportunity since I had the privilege of seeing them first. 
"We'll need names for the birth certificates, President Cornell," she prompted gently. "Have you and your wife decided?" 
Sarah and I had already talked about it. "Our daughter will be Iris, and our son, Preston." 
The doctor made a note, then excused herself, leaving Ethan and me with the twins. After a brief moment in the nursery, I headed to Sarah's recovery room, taking her hand. 
I sat beside her for what felt like hours, cherishing her serene face, tracing the curve of her cheek with my hand. 
"You've given me the most incredible gift. I can't wait for you to wake up and share this happiness," I murmured.  
Through the large, clear window of the recovery room, I spotted Assistant Alex. His posture was tense, and he seemed to be trying to catch my attention without being too obvious. 
'What's he doing?' 
Stepping out to meet Alex, I sensed the urgency in his demeanor. 
"Boss, I... I have bad news," Alex began. 
Noticing his discomfort, I led him further away from the ward to avoid disturbing anyone. I spotted Amir nearby, engaged in what appeared to be an intense phone conversation. 
Turning to Alex, I asked, "What is it?" 
Without a word, Alex handed me his iPad, displaying a video. 
I played it. A woman sat before the camera-it was Sarah! 
"I am Sarah Mitchell," the woman declared, "The original Sarah Benner! You heard it right! Someone is pretending to be me, deceiving everyone. I have to claim what's mine! That woman you all knew as Sarah Benner is fake! She's Lila Fox, my father's mistress's daughter. Just like her surname, she's a dog!" 
As the video ended, my mind raced, analyzing every detail.  
None of it made sense. Sarah wouldn't expose the truth this way. She was methodical, gathering evidence quietly and planning a calculated legal strike against Lila. Moreover, this woman's voice and accent were noticeably different from my wife's. 
"Boss, I think this woman might be the same one from the sex tape with Josh. She may also be behind its release online," Alex remarked. 
And I believe his assumption was correct. 
But right now, I don't give a fuck! A mere woman who looks exactly like my wife won't ruin my mood. 
I glanced over at Amir, who had just ended his call and was approaching us grimly. Before he could speak, I cut him off. 
"This is your problem to fix!"  
Amir's eyes widened in surprise, clearly unaccustomed to being given orders. "What the fuck are you talking about?" 
A mischievous grin tugged at my lips.  
"Fix it," I repeated, "or you won't get to meet my adorable newborns!" 
"Mr. Benner, I saw the babies earlier. They truly are precious!" Alex added. 
Amir was left speechless.
###chapter 133: Beyond Scandal 
**Sarah** 
The incident of the past left me severely traumatized after being admitted to the hospital. During the procedure, panic attacks overwhelmed me. My heart raced, and my breath came in short gasps. Philip's voice, though muffled through the operating room doors, tried to reassure me that he would stay outside to ensure the safety of me and our unborn babies. 
His words didn't ease my anxiety. The chilling memory of my last experience haunted me-the sudden fear upon waking to find my child no longer safe in my womb. The pain from that loss seemed to blend with my current discomfort, lingering in my body. 
"Dr. Vanderbilt, Ms. Mitchell's heart rate isn't stabilizing," Dr. Ruth informed Ethan. "Her blood pressure is very high, and it's difficult for me to continue the operation. This much stress could seriously harm her pregnancy." 
Ethan faced me urgently. "Sarah, you must calm down. I know you're scared, but this much stress could harm your babies. Let's take deep breaths together." 
"Ethan, please..." I pleaded, "I don't want to see Megan or Madam Cornell! I don't want to see evil people! They'll take my babies!" I spoke quickly and desperately, my hands tightly gripping the sheets. 
"I'm here. Look at me, Sarah Do you trust me? I will protect your babies with everything I have. I'm your friend. Can you believe that?" he said, looking directly into my gray eyes. 
I nodded repeatedly. The last thing I remembered was Ethan's voice soothing me, assuring me that my babies were safe. 
During the cesarean procedure, I drifted in and out of consciousness, feeling fuzzy from the medication. I caught snippets of sounds-the murmur of voices, the clink of instruments, the steady pressure of skilled hands at work. 
When I finally regained full awareness, intense pain shot through my body, especially around the fresh incision where they had delivered the babies. 
Beside the bed, I sensed someone slumped over. Philip's face turned toward me while he held my hand tightly. Gently withdrawing my hand, I softly ran my fingers through his hair. 
Feeling my touch, Philip stirred. He slowly lifted his head, a grimace flashing across his features as his stiff joints protested the sudden movement.  
"I'm so happy" he murmured. He gently took my hand, bringing it to his lips for a tender kiss. His eyes, rimmed with exhaustion, met mine. "But I'm so stressed and worried about your surgery. Ethan spent hours trying to calm you down." 
A wave of anxiety washed over me as I remembered the panic that had gripped me. 
"Are they safe, Philip?" I asked in a trembling voice. "Are they... healthy?"  
I feared that everything from the sex tape scandal onwards might have affected the twins. Thinking about the doctor and Ethan trying to calm me down, guilt gnawed at me, making me doubt whether I had been a good mother. 
Philip squeezed my hand reassuringly. "They're slightly premature but healthy, according to Ethan." 
"Where are they?" 
"In the nursery." 
A pang of jealousy shot through me. "You've met them already?"  
Philip's eyes softened with understanding. "Yes, they're as adorable as you, my love." Tears welled up in his eyes as he spoke, and I felt my emotions surge in response. 
Just then, a nurse entered the room, noticing my conscious state. The doctor followed, examining me thoroughly before instructing the nurse to bring the babies inside. 
They were so tiny, so perfect. Tears spilled down my cheeks as I gazed at them, overwhelmed by the joy and the lingering sorrow for my first child. The happiness I felt was indescribable-two breathing, living miracles blessed to me. 
"Philip, they're my babies..." I whispered in awe, my voice cracking with emotion. Tears of happiness streamed down my cheeks. 
Philip nodded, leaning in to place a gentle kiss on my forehead.  
I savored these precious moments with Philip and our children, setting aside the pain and negativity. This was our time-a bubble of joy amid the chaos we faced. 
"I will do everything to provide better for our family," Philip promised me. 
*** 
It had been a full day since our twins were unexpectedly born. Despite my apparent control over my movements, I was confined to bed. I sensed an issue looming, though it hadn't been explicitly brought to my attention. 
"Ethan and Dr. Ruth will examine you here at Serenity Pines, just as we arranged," Philip assured me from the edge of the bed, his fingers tracing delicate patterns on my skin.  
The babies slept peacefully in an ornate crib near the window. Philip's world now revolves entirely around our expanded family. 
"Amanda, Pepper, and Grandpa Mitchell are on a private jet from Dubai as we speak. I also contacted Emily and Bronn to keep them in the loop. They're all rushing here. Your executive assistant seemed quite taken aback by your labor," Philip remarked. 
"I hadn't informed Emily or my team about my pregnancy. They saw me on camera during a video conference, but apparently, my condition went unnoticed," I admitted. 
"You're quite good at keeping secrets," Philip teased, raising an eyebrow, to which I responded with a grin. 
Our moment was interrupted by a familiar, singsong voice from the hallway. "Yoo-hoo! New parents, where are you?" 
Jakob peeked in first, followed by Trey and Lexi, their faces lighting up as they saw the sleeping babies. 
"Oh my god, they're adorable!" Lexi whispered 
"Congratulations, dear friend!" Jakob exclaimed joyfully.  
I allowed them their moment, sharing my happiness with my friends. After a few moments of cheer, the mood turned serious. 
"Um..." Jakob glanced at Philip, hesitantly scratching his cheek as if seeking permission to share the news with me. 
Sensing their unease, I pressed, "Alright, what's happening? What aren't you all telling me?" Since giving birth, Philip had shielded me from troubling matters. 
But it was Philip who spoke up, divulging the truth. "A woman has come forward. A woman who... well, she looks exactly like you This woman exposed Lila publicly, claiming to be the real Sarah Benner." 
"The video's release caused a stir in the industry, leading to immediate internal investigations across all companies partnered with Lila. This scandal quickly became the most talked-about topic in business and social media circles. Not only are you Grandpa Mitchell's granddaughter, but also the ex-wife of Luminary Productions' president. And now, it's come to light that you're also Sarah Benner. Your identities have sparked extensive speculation and gossip." 
Philip was next to explain. "I gave the job to Amir because your family was deeply concerned. They weren't just worried but desperate to understand this person's motives." 
"Perhaps it's my status, wealth, connections, influence." 
'But who could it be? Who would dare to take such a risk?' 
"Your absence from public view for months created the perfect opportunity. This Sarah lookalike likely saw a chance to take your place without being immediately noticed," Jakob observed. 
"Or she might have other motives we haven't considered yet," Lexi interjected. 
"What about Bronn and Emily? Emily seems the likeliest target-she knows about my work, schedules, and business transactions." 
"You don't have to worry about Emily. She's under Bronn's protection," Jakob reassured. 
"But who is this person? If they know so much about me, it means they know me well," I nervously asked, feeling my wound ache. 
Jakob's gaze intensified. "Besides your family, who else knows you're the original Sarah Benner? Think carefully." 
"Well, about that" Lexi began, diverting attention momentarily from the babies she had been so captivated by. She opened her iPad and showed me a picture. "I saw her with this woman, which might help the case." 
"That's Madam Olsen!" Jakob exclaimed, leaning in for a closer look. 
The surveillance photo from above in a dimly lit restaurant showed four people sitting at a table: Madam Olsen, the woman impersonating me, and two men. 
My gaze didn't linger on the woman who resembled me but on the person next to her. Philip and I exchanged confused looks. 
"Let me see that!" Philip demanded sharply, seemingly unable to believe what he was seeing. 
Madam Olsen, her son, the woman impersonating me, and the man sitting next to them-it's Josh!
###chapter 134: The Imposter Game 
**Philip** 
Seeing Josh's picture, I struggle to articulate how it makes me feel. It's almost as though Mariano is playing games with me. 
Glancing at Sarah, I noticed her lips were still parted in disbelief. 
"I feel so stupid!" she exclaimed. Her hands gripped the clean white sheets. 
"Try to stay calm, love," I reassured, squeezing her hand. 
"I trusted him completely, Philip. I told him about my deepest feelings, my struggles... How could he betray me like this?" Her voice rose, tinged with anger and disbelief. "And who is this new Sarah? What kind of sick game is this?" 
Glancing at Jakob by the window, I hoped for his insight. He responded with a shrug, his expression tinged with concern.  
I hadn't told Sarah everything that happened because I didn't want to add more stress to her fragile state. 
"Don't worry about it. We'll figure this out," I assured her, trying to inject confidence into my voice. "We'll do everything we can." 
"But it doesn't make any sense! Did that person really think she could have my life just because she looks like me?" 
I wanted to agree, to tell her it doesn't work that way, but I held my tongue. The situation was more complicated than she knew. 
Instead, I raised her hand to my lips and gently kissed her knuckles. "You need to rest and take care of yourself. Let me handle this issue; I suspect Mariano's involvement. He won't leave me alone." 
"Could Madam Olsen have been working with Josh all this time?" Jakob pondered. "Remember how she took him to Romania to retrieve Philip's body? Anything could have happened then." 
It's plausible, but Sarah immediately dismissed the idea. "No, Philip! I trust Josh completely. So much has happened since then." 
"Another thing," Jakob pointed out, "Josh knew you were pregnant, Sarah, but this group doesn't seem to know that," his brow furrowed as he studied the photograph again. 
"I wonder what his motive could be," I pondered aloud, more to myself than anyone else. The pieces didn't quite make sense. 
Sarah sighed heavily, clearly frustrated. I could sense her confusion. 
"Enough with the stress. Everyone, please leave the room. I appreciate your concern for my wife, and thank you for visiting, but your presence is causing her distress," I said firmly. 
That was the last thing I wanted-to stress out my wife. 
"You can stay at Amir's villa," Sarah suggested, glancing at Trey to handle the arrangements. 
It was a practical suggestion. Amir's villa boasted high security and was conveniently close to Serenity Pines, allowing me to respond swiftly to any new developments. 
Once everyone had left, I sat on Sarah's bed, facing her. 
"You can count on me for this, babe. Somehow, this person is helping you resolve your issues with Lila. Companies are filing deception charges, and some products have been withdrawn. Amir said there's chaos in the Benner family. Your father wasn't fooled, though. He knew that woman wasn't really you. " 
My wife pondered profoundly and then nodded. "Oh, goodness! You're absolutely right!" 
Grinning, I was glad to see a glimpse of her usual self. "You married quite the capable husband, you know?" 
"Tss!" 
I chuckled. "For now, let them fight amongst themselves. You must focus on regaining strength and being a happy, healthy mother."  
Refusing to let outside issues disrupt our peace at Serenity Pines, this sanctuary was ours and free from outside disruptions. 
"Your mind is sharpest when you're calm We'll prepare and wait for the right moment to act." 
I lifted her chin gently with my finger and leaned in, pressing a soft, loving kiss to her lips.  
*** 
After two days, work demands couldn't be ignored any longer, especially given the recent developments.  
Sarah's scandal caused chaos at Luminary Productions. A press conference was scheduled, and my father, the chairman, called me to accompany the public relations team. 
As I adjusted my tie, I told Sarah, "Lexi and Jakob noticed a lot of buzz on social media, especially from those who said they saw us getting married in Las Vegas." 
Sarah's face contorted in a wince. 
"They're doing everything they can to scrub the internet," I continued, my fingers twisting the tie knot. "Taking down public posts, flagging videos-anything about our forced wedding." 
"Forced wedding?" she echoed. 
"Yeah, remember when you forced me to marry you?" I teased. 
She gave me a wicked smile. "But I asked you for a divorce practically before the ink was dry on the certificate!" 
"Right, right!" I said, finding her cute when she was riled up. I sat beside her on the bed, and she automatically helped me straighten my tie. 
"If reporters at the press conference ask about our marital status... are you comfortable with me confirming it?" I asked, hoping to dispel any lingering doubts. In my mind, I envisioned a future where Sarah had fully recovered: romantic dinners at our favorite restaurants, strolling hand-in-hand through the park, and attending red-carpet events as a power couple. 
"It's okay to confirm the marriage, but please don't mention the twins. The idea of the public knowing about them terrifies me," she replied. "Done!" she announced, finishing with the necktie. 
I knew Sarah was scared, especially if Marcus showed up unexpectedly. I had to investigate to make sure he wouldn't surprise us. 
Setting aside wedding concerns, she mentioned, "I was thinking of giving Jakob and Lexi an apartment near Luminary Productions as a token of appreciation for their hard work. Can you help me check it out? I want it to be a surprise and not trouble Emily right now, as she's closely managing Sophia and Mike." 
"Of course, I'll handle it." 
Jakob and Lexi definitely deserved recognition. I used to have unfounded jealousy toward Jakob. However, now I've come to see that they regard each other as extended family. Sarah's team has much work ahead of time, and arranging the apartment is just a small request. 
Before heading to the office, I gently kissed her lips. 
*** 
At Luminary Productions, especially in my father's office, tension filled the air as I met with the public relations team. They looked curious and concerned as we discussed my relationship with Sarah. 
"You mean to tell me you're still married?" my father asked. 
"Yes, those social media comments about people witnessing our wedding a few months ago are accurate. I remarried Sarah just before the accident that put me in a coma," I explained. 
I sensed a hint of satisfaction from Dad upon hearing this news. Sarah was more than just an ordinary woman; my father was finally starting to understand how important she was to the family. 
While he had never been openly abusive toward Sarah, he often treated her with indifference. He wasn't a good man by any means, but compared to my mother's cruel manipulations, he seemed like a saint. 
After the meeting ended, I walked out of the office and found Alex, my assistant, anxiously fidgeting in the hallway. It always makes me nervous when my assistant acts this way. Perhaps it's because we've been together for so long; I can usually read his mind. 
"Boss, there's a visitor in your office. Trey is there keeping an eye on her," he reported. 
"Why would you allow someone into my private office?" I frowned. 
"I had to, sir. It... it could potentially disrupt today's agenda," he replied. 
His unclear answer made me more uneasy. Without saying anything else, I walked quickly to my office, ready to face whoever this mysterious visitor was. 
Upon opening the door to my private office, I was surprised to find Sarah sitting elegantly on the couch, reading a newspaper. 
"Hello, babe!" she exclaimed, perfectly mimicking Sarah's gentle voice, as she gracefully stood up and moved towards me for a hug. 
Trey, who stood nearby, cleared his throat as a subtle warning. Of course, I was aware-it wasn't miraculous for my wife to rise from bed with fresh surgical wounds. 
As the imposter approached, I smelled her perfume-a strong scent that Sarah would never use. Quickly, I stepped back and firmly grabbed her shoulders, keeping her at a distance. 
"Who are you?" I demanded, my voice low and dangerous.
###chapter 135: Deceptive Encounter 
**Philip** 
"What do you mean, 'Who am I?'" the woman asked incredulously, shooting a questioning glance at Trey, feigning confusion. 
A smirk tugged at the corner of my lips. "Sarah's expressions, the way she speaks, her subtle gestures, even her scent-they're all unique to her. Yours, on the other hand... it's pungent." I took a deep breath, noticing her overpowering perfume. 
Curious to uncover her identity, I chose my words carefully, masking my intent with floral phrases, hoping she would continue the charade. 
"Why are you doing this to me, Philip?" She sank into the soft leather couch, her movements awkward and exaggerated. With narrowed eyes, she scrutinized me, her voice thick with feigned emotion.  
"Is this about Josh? I promise, there's nothing between us. I did have feelings for him once, but they mean nothing-nothing compared to what I feel for you..." Her voice trembled, tears welling in her eyes but not spilling over. 
Even Trey wasn't buying her Oscar-worthy performance, coughing awkwardly. 
"I was only gone for a few months, and you've already forgotten me?" she added. 
I shrugged nonchalantly, then locked eyes with her, my gaze unwavering.  
"I know it's you-Megan." 
Her eyes narrowed, and then she chuckled. "Tss! You're no fun at all, Philip." 
"And you're pathetic for trying to imitate Sarah," I responded firmly, my voice sharp.  
My remark struck a nerve. She gritted her teeth, the muscles in her jaw tightening visibly. Settling into a chair opposite her, I studied Megan closely, noting every minute detail that distinguished her from my Sarah. 
"Everyone else believed I was Sarah Mitchell," Megan said, finally dropping the act. "That's why I'm here in your private office. Did she mean so much to you that you can tell us apart at a glance?"  
"That's right! Perhaps acting isn't your forte," I replied coolly, leaning back in my chair. "As president of Luminary Productions, I've worked closely with actors. Your performance wouldn't even pass muster in a high school drama class!"  
"You-" Megan seethed, clearly stung by my words. 
Her composure was crumbling rapidly, much to my satisfaction. 
"Yes, I must admit, your little performance was momentarily entertaining. But you couldn't capture Sarah's gray eyes. That's how I knew you were a fake right from the beginning Megan, we've been friends. Did you believe I wouldn't recognize you immediately?" 
I fixed her with a scornful look. 
"Sarah doesn't use perfume," I stated matter-of-factly. It was a detail Megan had overlooked, unaware of how scents could trigger Sarah's panic attacks.  
"You're also taller than Sarah by an inch, so the heels you wore this afternoon were lower. Thanks for the effort, though. In imitation, it's the little things that reveal the fake. Cheap and easy to break." 
My words were intentionally hurtful. Megan and I were friends before, but what she did destroyed any fondness I had for her. Disgust churned inside me, wiping out any remaining affection. 
I continued, "I don't know why you're doing this, Megan. Did you think that everything would fall into place just because you resemble Sarah? That you could simply step into her life and claim what's hers?" 
"Maybe I was stupid, Philip!" she exploded, her carefully constructed façade crumbling. "Since I returned here after your divorce from Sarah, I've felt hopeless. Your mother made me believe we could be together if I just played along. I hoped you'd finally see me how I wanted-that you'd love me! And what do I get, huh?" 
I didn't realize how much truth was in her words. All I knew was that I treated Megan as a friend. 
Her teeth clenched in frustration. "All you see is Sarah, Sarah, Sarah! Now, you're seeing me as Sarah; aren't you going to love me too, Philip?" Her voice carried a deep emotional weight. 
I scoffed, unmoved by her outburst. "Wow, Megan. Is that what this is about? Did you think you could use Josh, drain his accounts, and use that money to crawl back to Highland Hills? Don't make me laugh. You don't love me." 
Sarah had confided in me about Josh's true character and his past relationship with Megan. 
"You just liked the idea of living in Serenity Pines and being my wife because you couldn't find anyone better! But let's be honest here-you're facing financial charges from multiple investors in Highland Hills, and the police are after you for the murder of that maid, among other serious offenses." 
Megan's face paled, her glare intensifying as she swallowed hard. 
"Let me lay out my theory," I began, "You fled Highland Hills after securing evidence that framed you as the prime suspect in your house's arson. On top of that, you amassed funds from various investors, but now you're strapped for cash!" 
I paused, gauging her reaction before continuing.  
"You discovered Sarah's true identity at Ethan's family salon-with Rebecca present-that my wife is the real Sarah Benner. Since Sarah doesn't use her true identity, you boldly decided to adopt it as your own. But you didn't stop there, did you? You went further and conspired with Madam Olsen." 
Megan's lips curled into a smirk. "Your deductive skills are impressive, Philip, but not entirely on the mark. You've got it backward. Madam Olsen approached me, not the other way around. She's the one who suggested I undergo facial surgery even before your trip to Romania for the car race  
"She opened my eyes to the potential benefits and painted a picture of a future I couldn't resist. It's irritating, to say the least, that you saw through me right from the start. I thought I had you fooled." 
"There's more," I narrowed my eyes at her and voiced my concern. "You were at the cemetery during my mother's burial. I saw you lurking by an oak tree. You've been meticulously tracking my family's movements. Were you also working with Josh? Is that why he suddenly decided to return to his medical career? And where is he now?" 
Megan frowned deeply, a look of surprise crossing her face. She appeared genuinely taken aback by our knowledge of Josh's survival, her usual composure faltering briefly. 
"I have no idea what you're talking about. Didn't you kill him?" She splayed her fingers as she spoke, examining her perfectly manicured nails with exaggerated nonchalance-an apparent attempt to mask her discomfort. 
My smile widened, sensing weakness; Megan clearly knew more than she let on. 
"If so, then you're aware Josh is dead?"  
She didn't know I was catching her, so I've been in the mood to talk since earlier. Megan knows a lot! Maybe it's because of her relationship with Madam Olsen. 
Megan's lips curved into an unsettling smile. It felt disturbingly out of place, sending a chill down my spine and reminding me she wasn't my wife. 
"Tell me the truth," I pressed, leaning even closer. "How did you manage to save Josh from the battle and the treacherous sea currents in the Viper Turf War?"
###chapter 136: Art of Misdirection 
**Philip**  
The burial of my mother and my fight with Josh happened on the same day. If I had seen this woman pretending to be Sarah on that day, there's a good chance she knew exactly where I was going and what I was thinking. 
Mariano's new assistant informed me that Josh's body was missing. The strong ocean currents had taken him, leaving no trace. After a week of searching, Josh was officially declared dead. 
I wondered just how much Megan knew about Mariano's network. Was she just a pawn or a key player in this twisted game? 
On the other hand, Sarah told me that Josh was furious with this woman because of what she did. But I began to doubt: what if the bodyguard lied to Sarah to manipulate my wife's trust? The thought made me feel sick. 
If Josh lied, it would definitely hurt Sarah's feelings. 
Josh's true motives were a mystery, a puzzle with pieces that didn't quite fit together. His skill at moving between Megan, Mariano, Madam Olsen, and Sarah effortlessly made me doubt everything. Who is he behind his masks? 
Megan cut through my thoughts. "I don't understand what you're saying, Philip." That was the second time she denied it. "A video just surfaced recently. Maybe Josh and Sarah really had a relationship behind your back, and they even managed to have sex at Serenity Pines," she said, curling her lips into a malicious smirk. 
She stood up gracefully, moving towards me with deliberate and provocative steps. A heavy, unpleasant scent surrounded her-a mix of strong perfume and something sinister that made me recoil in disgust. 
In a fit of anger, I stood up and closed the gap between us. My hands gripped her neck, fingers pressing on her pulse. The disgust I felt inside me boiled over, fueled by her last hurtful words. 
"I think you need to be careful with me," I growled, my voice low and dangerous. "I'm not a saint, and you've given me a very easy job by coming here," I told her. 
"W-what do you mean?" 
I glanced at Trey before fixing my gaze back on Megan.  
"What I mean is, I won't let you tarnish Sarah's reputation. You can't, Megan Not now, not ever."  
Trey's deep voice came from behind me. "Boss, everything was recorded and caught on camera." 
The color drained from Megan's face. "You bastard!" she spat, her composure cracking. "What are you planning to do with me?" 
For the first time, I saw genuine fear in her eyes-a feeling she couldn't fake, even with Sarah's borrowed identity. It reminded me starkly of the contrast between the woman I loved and the impostor standing before me. 
"Mr. Beckett has been asking for you," I said, watching as recognition and terror flooded her features. 
Mr. Beckett is a powerful business tycoon whom Megan allegedly seduced and extorted into securing an eight-digit deal, despite his marital status. He also owned the villa that mysteriously burned down. 
"He's been searching for you since your sudden disappearance from Highland Hills, Surely, you're aware of your misdeeds. He's furious, and I can only guess what he plans to do to you," I warned. 
Megan's mask fell away entirely. "No, Philip, please!" she begged, her voice filled with panic. "Don't give me to him! He'll kill me!" 
Two bodyguards entered, with Alex following closely behind. My heart raced as her screams echoed while they escorted her away. 
*** 
**Sarah** 

A month has passed, and I can feel a noticeable improvement in my overall well-being. Philip made a public declaration that our marriage remains strong, effectively silencing the rumors that had been swirling around us. More importantly, he took steps to clear my name regarding the infamous sex tape. 
Philip hired a team of experts, including forensic specialists and body language analysts, to release a comprehensive statement. This document highlighted distinct differences in body shape, movements, and even subtle mannerisms. 
With the issue surrounding me now settled after a month, if there's anything on my mind, it's Josh. 
Dr. Ruth, who is also thirty years old, examined me and my body. To ensure my safety outside Serenity Pines, she arrived at the villa early. 
"You can leave the villa, Ms. Mitchell, but don't exert yourself. You still need to take care of your body," the doctor reminded me.  
Her words brought a wide smile to my face. After what seemed like an endless time at Serenity Pines, the thought of returning to a normal routine filled me with excitement. 
"Call me immediately if there are any issues," the doctor said before leaving the room. 
As the doctor left, Philip approached me. His hand gently brushed my cheek. "Are you certain about visiting the office?"  
"Yes, I am. It's been so long since I've stepped outside of Serenity Pines. I promise it'll just be a short visit to meet with Emily's team, then I'll come straight back. I know you're worried, Philip, but it's been over a month of recovery. Besides, I won't be doing anything too demanding." 
I feel guilty because those around me have worked hard. Philip managed most of the accounts I handled in the stock market, and Emily coordinated with him to ensure everything ran smoothly. 
Kissing the twins on the forehead, I then turned back to Philip. "It's your special time with your babies!" I giggled, giving his shoulder a gentle pat. 
"And I'm going to love every second of it," Philip replied, his arms encircling my waist. His voice dropped to a husky whisper, "Though I probably should have asked Dr. Ruth when I could 'score' with my wife again." 
"I'll make it up to you, don't worry!" Blush crept up my cheeks. 
Jakob and Trey accompanied me to the office. On the way, our talk turned into something I'd been thinking about. 
"I've been meaning to ask," Jakob said, breaking a moment of silence, "why haven't we seen much of Jane lately?" 
My expression turned serious as I contemplated Jane's recent absence.  
"To be honest, I'm not sure either. I'm worried about her too," I admitted, a frown creasing my brow. "Strangely enough, it seems we were closer when she lived in London than we are now. Philip said he talked to her and Jane's okay. She's only visited Serenity Pines once after I gave birth." 
"Perhaps she's just busy... or, um," he trailed off, scratching his head uncertainly. 
I raised an eyebrow, intrigued by his hesitation. Jakob and Jane weren't very close, but his reaction hinted he might have information I didn't know. "Do you know something?" 
Finally, he admitted, "The truth is, she's become a VIP player in LoveLogic." 
"Oh, really?" This was news to me. I had assumed Jane was occupied with office work, not immersed in the virtual world of LoveLogic. 
"She's been... pursuing Bronn as her boyfriend in the game." 
At first, I didn't see anything particularly concerning about this. Jane designed Bronn's character. 
But Jakob's next words caught me off guard. "Sarah, I think she's in love with my brother. Actually, she confessed to Bronn when they met recently." 
"Oh! That's unexpected!" 
Our conversation was interrupted as the car stopped in front of the building where the office was located. Through the tinted windows, I could see Emily waiting for me on the sidewalk. 
Exiting the vehicle, Jakob, Trey, and another bodyguard followed me. Emily and I exchanged greetings until I noticed Josh not far away, his long strides bringing him closer to me. 
"Josh!" I exclaimed in surprise to see him there. 
Trey and the other bodyguard's eyes narrowed when they saw him. They swiftly moved to intercept Josh before he could get too close to me. 
"Sarah! I've missed you so much!" Josh's voice was thick with emotion. "You've been gone from our house for a month. You only said you were going to Luminary Productions, and then you vanished!" 
Jakob and I exchanged glances. His words made no sense to me-what house was he talking about? 
Josh gritted his teeth in frustration as my bodyguards maintained their firm grip on him, keeping him at a distance of about two meters. 
"Let me go!" he shouted, struggling against their hold. 
I glanced around nervously.  
"Trey," I whispered urgently, "we're in public." 
On my very first day out of Serenity Pines, fate seemed to be playing tricks on me.  
What on earth was happening?
###chapter 137: Shielded Truths 
**Sarah**  
Josh was invited into the office to handle the situation discreetly rather than causing a public scene. Thankfully, a small, well-appointed meeting room is prepared for visiting business partners. 
This room called the Summit Room, is where Lexi and Jakob usually work when they're at Highland Hills overseeing the LoveLogic project app development. 
At this moment, Josh is seated in the Summit Room. Two trusted security guards stand watch near the door. Looking professionally detached, Jakob sits across from Josh with his laptop open, but his attention is focused on him. 
In the main office, I introduced myself to Mike and Sophia.  
"It's a pleasure to meet you both in person," I greeted them, trying to sound warm despite the turmoil in my mind. Mike gave a firm handshake, and Sophia smiled. 
"It's an honor to meet you face-to-face finally, Ms. Sarah!" Mike replied enthusiastically. 
Forcing a smile, sweat formed on my forehead. I was waiting for Philip to arrive, as Trey had already alerted him that Josh was here in the office. 
"Please forgive me for only meeting you now, even though the job was taken on months ago. I'm dealing with some personal issues." 
"Of course, that's completely understandable!" Mike responded quickly, sounding sympathetic. "President Cornell has always been very kind and understanding to our team." 
Sophia, who had been quiet until now, suddenly spoke up, "Um, Ms. Mitchell, if you don't mind me asking... why is Josh being watched in the Summit Room?"  
Emily cleared her throat, seemingly wanting to warn Sophia about her question. 
I forced another smile, trying to hide my tension. My heart raced, but I kept my voice steady. "If you recall, there was a sex tape that spread last month. I just want to question how he could do that to me." 
Sophia's cheeks immediately flushed a deep crimson, and she looked down at her feet, clearly embarrassed. 
"Ah, right! It's good that President Cornell explained and brought in an expert to tell the public it wasn't you, Ms. Sarah," Mike replied. 
Emily smoothly interjected, "Anyway, we have a meeting scheduled. I'll take both of you to meet with the jewelry shop owner this morning. They want to discuss how to prevent any future security issues." 
I considered doing this. The last thing I wanted was for Mike and Sophia to witness any potential confrontation with Josh. It would create a terrible first impression, especially after how long we'd been communicating virtually. 
However, if the suggestion came from me, it would seem like I was hiding something. 
"Thank you for your hard work. Don't worry, I'll make it up to you." I handed my credit card to Emily. "Please, take good care of them. Treat them to a nice meal on me." 
As I spoke, Emily and I shared a long, meaningful glance. Her slight nod conveyed that she understood the delicacy of the situation and would handle it discreetly. 
Emily continued, calm and professional, "Mike, Sophia, please wait for me in the lobby. I need to organize the documents we'll need for the meeting." 
Mike and Sophia nodded and headed for the elevator. Once we were alone in the main office room, Emily's professional demeanor softened. She wrapped her arms around me in a comforting embrace. 
"Thank you, Emily!" I said, grateful she knew exactly what to do. 
"I'll take care of them, don't worry. You focus on what you need to do here," she assured me. 
I nodded as Emily squeezed my arm before following the two assistants out. 
Left alone in the room, I sank into a nearby chair, my thoughts racing. For a month, Philip had shielded me from all this, handling everything independently. I was already grappling with panic attacks, and the last thing we needed was for me to be overwhelmed by postpartum issues. 
But now, I needed to confront this head-on. I couldn't remain in the dark any longer. Philip would definitely argue against it, but the thought of staying isolated at Serenity Pines while all this unfolded was unbearable.  
Five minutes passed before the door opened, and Philip entered with Assistant Alex. He strode over and embraced me. 
"Are you okay?" he murmured into my hair. Then he pulled back, his expression serious. "I'll take care of him," he said, already turning toward the Summit Room. 
I grabbed his arm, my grip firm. "I'm coming!" I insisted, my tone leaving no room for argument. 
"No, Sarah! He's dangerous!" he shot back. 
"No!" I countered, a sudden realization dawning on me. "Philip, is there something you're not telling me? The impostor Sarah Mitchell is missing. Josh said earlier, the woman went to Luminary Productions last month... Did you meet her?" 
It hit me then that there had been no updates on what the fake Sarah had been up to. Something was definitely wrong. 
"Boss, I'll wait outside," Alex said, clearly uncomfortable with our argument. 
Philip's jaw clenched. "She's under Mr. Beckett's control," he admitted reluctantly. "Honestly, I have no idea what's happening to her now. She might even be dead."  
I bit my lip, my mind racing to piece together the fragments of information. Mr. Beckett was one of the businessmen I'd interacted with during virtual meetings at Aspire Financial Group. I had heard that Megan had scammed him out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was also rumored to be the valid owner of Megan's villa. 
The pieces of the puzzle were coming together. To sum up, Megan had created a fake persona as a sophisticated lady, claiming to be the daughter of wealthy European aristocrats. But it was all an elaborate fabrication. She was using money from various sources to maintain the lavish lifestyle she had invented-that of a refined, affluent socialite. 
"My impersonator-you mean she's Megan?"  
Philip nodded grimly, confirming my suspicion. 
"Now it makes sense!" I exclaimed, my mind racing. "I just need to know Josh's role in all this." 
Without waiting for Philip's response, I hurried out of the room. In the hallway, I saw Assistant Alex, who seemed unsure how to meet my gaze. 
"Sarah!" Philip grabbed my arm to restrain me. "You're not strong enough yet! What if Josh hurts you? We don't even know his motives." 
"I have a motive! I wanted to grab a gun and go berserk! Move!" I yelled at him, my voice sharp and filled with fury. 
Alex flinched at my outburst. When I glanced his way, he looked genuinely afraid and quickly retreated toward the room Philip and I had just left. 
Philip released my arm as if he'd been burned. Frowning, I strode purposefully into the Summit Room. All eyes immediately turned towards me as I entered. 
Jakob stood up. "Guys, I know there might have been a misunderstanding between you two, but we have some news." 
"What is it?" I asked, glancing at Josh, who remained seated, fists clenched tightly on the table, staring at the floor. 
Trey cleared his throat before responding, "He doesn't remember his past." 
"Ahhh!" Josh groaned and angrily tugged at his hair. I flinched, and Philip's security team instantly went on high alert. 
Josh's gaze was restless as he spoke, "I have these... visions that I see. I- You can't leave me like this, Sarah! I know you're married. It's in the news, but you came with me and said you left President Cornell!" 
Philip's eyes narrowed at Josh's words, a flash of anger crossing his face. I shot him a warning look, silently pleading for him to stay calm. 
"I'm sorry, Josh, but I'm not the woman you've been with these past few months." 
His lips parted in shock. 
I continued, "It was Megan. Only she could mess with your head like this... I'm not the woman in your residence right now, or the woman... you slept with or had a relationship with. That's not me..." 
"Aaugh!" He screamed, clearly struggling to accept my words. He abruptly stood and headed towards the door. Philip's security team tensed, their hands moving to their weapons. But Josh just rushed past me and out of the Summit room.  
Everything that had happened hit me all at once. I couldn't hold back any longer. Tears filled my eyes, a blend of relief, sadness, and strong emotion.
###chapter 138: Aching Space Between 
**Sarah**   
"Could everyone please leave Philip and me alone?" I asked, addressing everyone in the Summit Room. 
Jakob hesitated, then gave an understanding nod before leaving. They all exited one by one until Trey was the last to leave. 
Once Philip and I were alone, a heavy silence filled the room. I wiped away my tears, trying to compose myself. My husband's eyes narrowed as he looked at me, taking in my reactions. 
"What is it that I don't know, Philip? "What am I missing that's left me so blindsided by all this?" I pleaded, desperate for answers. 
He laughed bitterly, surprising me.  
"You're asking me that, Sarah?" He shook his head. "Now you know how it feels to be kept in the dark, to have secrets kept from you!" His voice rose slightly, his hurt and frustration showing. 
Stunned into silence, I opened my mouth a few times, but no words came out. His words hurt, and finding any explanations was a struggle. 
Philip's face twisted with deep pain. "Sarah, I need you to be honest with me, just this once," he said, "Did you love Josh?" 
The question felt like a punch. "What?" 
He continued, unable to hold back his emotions any longer. "I've tried so hard to hide my jealousy for so long. I've kept it inside, even though it tore me apart because I thought I shouldn't complain!"  
His words rushed out, years of feelings pouring out.  
"You care for Josh, Sarah. That much is obvious to anyone with eyes. I don't understand the nature of the bond you two share, but I'm not blind. Just admit it-you loved him! You wouldn't be so devastated if he meant nothing to you!" 
'What? No!' 
I cried even harder. My body trembled at his accusation. It was challenging to explain to Philip what I felt because he would never understand. But I couldn't deny the truth in Philip's words-I had hidden things from him, letting this situation worsen until it reached this breaking point. 
Philip whispered painfully, each word filled with the anguish of someone who had silently endured for too long.  
"Did you honestly believe it was acceptable for me to witness you forming a bond with my bodyguard? Did you think it was okay for me to see Josh kiss you or how torn you seemed without his presence? Did you think I wouldn't notice how much you cared for him?" 
"Philip" I murmured his name. 
He continued, his voice trembling, "I admit it, Sarah. I wanted Josh out of our lives. Your feelings for him aren't simple, and I'm... I'm consumed by jealousy over the relationship you two share I know it's my fault. You wouldn't feel this way if I had given you the time and attention you needed back then. I don't have the right to these feelings, but I can't help it. You love him, Sarah... and it hurts so much." 
Tears filled my eyes, and I covered my mouth as Philip's words hit me hard. His perception shook me deeply. 
Finally, I found my voice. "Do you want the truth? Maybe I was drawn to Josh, or maybe it was because he showed me unconditional love, Philip." I took a deep breath, steeling myself to continue. "He stayed with your team for months, ensuring I wouldn't suffer from panic episodes again. He loved me, Philip-even if it was simple. It was a kind of love you didn't give me back then." 
Witnessing the pain my words caused, I saw it reflected in Philip's eyes. His fist clenched tightly with tension. He turned and departed from the Summit room without uttering a word, leaving me with tears. 
Moments later, Jakob entered and gently rubbed my back as I sobbed uncontrollably. 
"Tell me what happened," Jakob urged softly 
Between gasping breaths, I managed to say, "I told him everything."  
The pain of my confession still burned on my cheeks. Slowly and hesitantly, I explained everything to Jakob. 
After listening patiently, he asked the inevitable question. "But how do you really feel about Josh, Sarah? Have you thought about why your husband continues to feel jealous of him? I thought your relationship with Josh was purely professional." He paused, weighing his words. "Even if I were in Philip's shoes, I wouldn't appreciate what I saw today."  
"But, Jakob. Philip is the one I love. It's natural for me to worry about Josh because he has no family. I admit we shared deep conversations, and there was mutual trust. Our relationship wasn't just professional. It was... special," I explained. 
Jakob's hand moved in soothing circles on my back as he spoke, his voice gentle but firm.  
"That's why your husband is hurting. Because you didn't confess to him. You keep insisting that your relationship with Josh is purely professional, but your treatment of him runs much deeper."  
I sniffled, my voice thick with emotion. "I finally admitted it to Philip, but it hurt him more." 
"I've observed your relationship with Philip. I believe you haven't loved or accepted anyone besides him, but from what you told him earlier, he might have gotten a different impression. Like you, Philip is haunted by fears that you might leave him because of past events, and he sees Josh as a formidable rival." 
With gentle fingers, Jakob wiped the tears that had spilled onto my cheeks. His touch was comforting. "Your feelings are valid, but try to understand that Philip has reason to be hurt as well." 
Leaving the room, I searched the office for Philip but couldn't find him. This was our first argument since our whirlwind wedding in Las Vegas. 
Upon returning to Serenity Pines Estate, I spotted Philip with the twins. He was carrying both of them, their tiny bodies cradled in his strong arms. His face wore a smile, but his eyes held a sadness that tugged at my heart. It seemed as though he was channeling all his pain into this tender moment with our children. 
Amanda greeted me, noticing my swollen eyes. "Are you okay, dear?" 
I couldn't hold back anymore. Falling into Amanda's motherly embrace, I let the tears flow freely. "Philip is angry with me..." 
Amanda stroked my hair soothingly. "No wonder he didn't come home happy either. But don't worry, you'll patch things up. These things happen in marriages." She paused, looking over my shoulder. "Oh, there he is, heading inside." 
I followed Amanda's gaze to see Philip walking towards the villa's main building; Iris was nestled in his arms, her little head resting on his shoulder, while Pepper trailed behind, carefully holding Rowan. 
Amanda took Iris from Philip. "You two talk things out, and we'll take care of your little ones for now." 
Philip seemed at a loss for words, tension evident in his stance. 
"Can we talk?" I asked tentatively. 
His expression softened, and he gently pulled me into his arms. I breathed in his familiar scent as he kissed my forehead tenderly.  
"I'm sorry, my love," he whispered. 
Holding me close, Philip led me into the bedroom.  
He sat me down on the edge of the bed, then knelt before me. His strong arms encircled my waist, his forehead resting against my stomach. I could feel his warm breath through my shirt. 
"I'm really sorry" he murmured, sensing my presence. 
I ran my fingers through his hair, trying to soothe him. "Let's talk about Josh and then put this behind us. Is that okay?" I suggested softly. "I want to clarify that what I feel for him isn't romantic. It's... special, but not in that way." 
Philip's gaze met mine. I continued, choosing my words carefully.  
"During my recovery, Josh was often there. He helped cleanse my damaged soul, in a way. I feel sad about him because I didn't see Josh simply as a bodyguard, Philip I saw him as an older brother." 
He nodded. "I understand, and I apologize for what I said earlier. I'm just frustrated seeing him again. I was apprehensive about you because it was the first day you went out and immediately faced a problem. I was terrified something might happen to you. I'm so sorry, my love." 
We shifted positions. Philip sat on the single couch and pulled me onto his lap, cradling me against his chest. 
"I love you so much, Sarah," he whispered into my hair. "I'm terrified at the thought of you leaving me because of my past mistakes. When I saw our children earlier, it reminded me of my promise-to never make you cry and to love you deeply, always." 
"Let's support each other and have no more secrets, okay?" I suggested, searching his eyes. 
He kissed me on the forehead. Silence lingered between us before I remembered his sister.  
"By the way, how's Jane? She hasn't been answering my calls." 
"She seems okay. She asked about you the other day." 
Little did I know then, but Jane was far from okay. I could never have imagined that one day, my dear friend would betray me in ways I couldn't yet fathom
###chapter 139: Heart's Commitment 
**Bronn** 
It's been months since I convinced Emily to come with me to Henderson. However, her commitments to Sarah's group often keep her in Highland Hills, which frustrates and intrigues me. Balancing our new life together and her ongoing responsibilities has been a delicate dance. 
We were both surprised to learn that Sarah frequently stays at Serenity Pines because she is pregnant, something she cannot disclose publicly. Tonight, as I prepared to attend a high-profile gathering while Emily stepped in as Sarah's representative, we were getting ready to leave the mansion together.  
"Daddy, can't I come with you and Mommy?" Willow asked as I put on my necktie. Emily was being attended to by three stylists in another room. 
"Come here," I said softly, beckoning her closer. As she rushed toward me, eyes wide with excitement, I realized how much my life had transformed. In an instant, I went from being alone to experiencing pure happiness.  
I scooped Willow up, relishing the weight of her in my arms, and planted a kiss on her petal-soft cheeks.  
"Mommy said the party is only for big people," she said, her lower lip jutting out in an adorable pout. 
"I know it's disappointing," I said, "But we'll bring you along when you're a bit older, okay? To make it up to you, how about we have a special tea party tomorrow? Just you, me, and Mommy."  
"Yay! I want to play with Iris and Rowan once they get bigger, too!" Those were Sarah and Philip's twins. 
The three of us visited Sarah after she gave birth. For now, she is still recovering, and I think it will take two or three months before Sarah can personally handle her tasks again. 
"Of course," I chuckled. "And maybe, if you're good, we can visit Auntie Sarah's babies, Iris and Rowan, next week. Would you like that?" 
"Yes, yes, yes!" Willow squealed, bouncing in my arms. I kissed her cheeks again. 
It was at this moment that I caught sight of Emily standing in the doorway, and my breath caught in my throat. Her hair was styled in a detailed bun. She wore a long gown in rich purple that shimmered as she walked. The color suited her fair skin, and the dress elegantly highlighted her figure. Her makeup was subtle yet flawless, enhancing her natural beauty. 
I was utterly mesmerized, unable to look away as she glided towards us.  
"It looks like you finally managed to convince her to stay here with just her nanny," Emily said, kissing Willow on the cheek. Her simple perfume filled the air. 
"You're... stunning," I breathed, the words escaping before I could stop them.  
A blush crept across Emily's cheeks, and she returned the conversation to our departure. 
"We need to leave so we can return quickly," she suggested.  
The three of us walked together to Willow's room to personally tuck our child into bed. After tonight's gathering, I have plans for us. I'd already spoken with my parents about my intentions, explaining Emily's situation. They understood, but their acceptance was tinged with reservation. Emily's background as an orphan from a modest family didn't align with their vision of a suitable wife for their son. 
When I first announced my intention to marry Emily, I recalled my father's words: "You don't have to marry her, Bronn."  
It was a weighty declaration. I clarified that they shouldn't meddle in my personal life with Emily.  
If you ask my dad, he still harbored hopes of me marrying into a prestigious family. As the head of BM Technologies, I'd made my own name in the business world, becoming a sought-after bachelor. But Sarah's words rang in my ears: I was my own man, and no one-not even my parents-should control my life choices. 
This journey with Emily completely changed how I see things. My structured world of contracts and traditions was turned upside down, but I've learned to find a middle ground with Emily, merging our different perspectives into a shared vision for our future. 
"Goodnight, baby!" Emily's soft voice pulled me from my reverie, returning me to the present moment.  
A knock at the door interrupted the peaceful scene. "Boss, your ride has arrived," came a voice from the hallway. 
I turned to Emily, who was gently kissing Willow's forehead.  
"Are you ready?" I asked, admiring how she managed to look both maternal and breathtakingly elegant in her evening gown. 
As we left Willow's room, I wrapped an arm around Emily's waist as we made our way to the helipad where the helicopter had landed, avoiding the annoyance of traffic. Tonight's gathering on the Las Vegas Strip is convenient for us, just a few miles from Henderson. 
"Sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed by the life you've given me," Emily confessed as we stepped out of the grand mansion's ornate entrance. The helicopter hovered gracefully over the meticulously maintained Bermuda grass.  
I grinned and guided her towards it, helping her board. We landed at the hotel helipad within minutes, where the gathering awaited. 
As we walked through the luxurious hallway, Emily brought up a topic about Sarah. "Did you know she's pregnant?" 
"I had no idea, but I have a feeling Jakob might have known," I replied. Another thought about Sarah crossed my mind. "By the way, how's your professional relationship with Philip developing? I hope he hasn't caused you any trouble." 
"Oh, I have absolutely no issues with Philip," she assured me. "In fact, I'm often pleasantly surprised because we are frequently on the same wavelength when it comes to handling Sarah's accounts." 
"That's because you're brilliant, Emily," I remarked. 
She smiled, a blush coloring her cheeks. 
"You know," I continued, expressing my admiration, "I'm grateful you joined Sarah's team. You've made a remarkable name for yourself in less than a year. It's impressive. When people ask about Emily Carter, they already know you're one of the industry's highest-paid and most respected executive assistants. Your reputation speaks for itself." 
"The assistant who commutes by helicopter daily," she giggled softly. 
I couldn't help but ponder how different things might be if Emily were on my team instead.  
There would undoubtedly be gossip and speculation about whether her beauty was being used to get my attention. People love to gossip, and while I usually ignore it, I'm more concerned now. I'm not just a businessman anymore; I'm a father and a man deeply in love with a woman I want to protect. 
In Sarah's team, there are no such accusations, but I often worry about Emily's health and well-being. Her high-profile job can be very stressful. 
"Are you sure it's okay for us to be seen together by reporters?" she asked, a hint of worry in her voice. 
"Absolutely! I'm exclusively dating the most stunning executive assistant. Who would disapprove?" I teased. 
Her arm hooked onto mine more securely as we stepped onto the plush red carpet. A sea of cameras immediately began to click and flash around us.  
"Mr. Martin!" a reporter called out, thrusting a microphone in our direction. "Can you share with us who your stunning date is this evening?" 
"Hi, I'm Emily Carter!" Emily replied, flashing a dazzling smile.  
"Wow! You two look adorable together. Are you a fan of Mr. Martin's?" the reporter pressed mischievously. 
Emily's smile faltered slightly. It was clear that I had garnered more female admirers following the launch of Bronn, my non-player character in LoveLogic. This led to widespread guessing that any woman seen with me might be a hopeful admirer trying to get my attention. 
"Actually, it's quite the opposite. I'm the one who's Emily's devoted fan! I've been the one pursuing her relentlessly," I replied. 
The reporters were thrilled. It was my first time bringing a date to such a high-profile event, and they were eager to ask many questions about this unexpected development. I happily answered their inquiries, staying close to Emily to protect her. 
Once we managed to slip away from the group of reporters, Emily looked visibly drained.  
"Geez!" she exclaimed under her breath. 
Throughout the gathering, Emily confidently mingled with officials while I engaged in conversation with a few people until Jane Cornell tapped me on the shoulder. Her presence surprised me. 
"Hi!" she greeted 
"Oh, hi!" I responded, leaning in to place a customary kiss on her cheek. "Are you here as your family's representative for the event?" 
"Yeah... I just arrived. Um, can I talk to you privately for a moment?" 
Thinking it might involve Sarah and the twins, a private matter not for public discussion, I agreed to Jane's idea. We walked to an open area next to the main hall, where we found ourselves by a sparkling pool under the clear blue fluorescent. A refreshing breeze offered relief from the stuffy indoor air, and I saw a few familiar faces chatting quietly nearby. 
"Bronn, um, I'm in love with you," Jane declared, shocking me to the core. 
How should I respond to that? 'Thank you?' 
"My dad said he'll help me talk to your family so we can have a relationship. I'm telling you this so you won't be surprised if they approach you," she explained. 
"Hold on, hold on, Jane. Um, I'm sorry, Jane... but I can't. I want you to know I'm getting married soon. You know I'm committed to someone else, right? I love her, and she's the one I want to marry." 
Pain etched across her face, and then tears began to spill down her cheeks. 
I was perplexed because Jane and I had only interacted briefly in person; our relationship was more of a professional acquaintance than a close friend, let alone a romantic interest. 
Why was she acting like this?
###chapter 140: Eclipsed by Love 
**Emily** 
I spotted Bronn and Jane, Philip Cornell's sister, slipping away from the bustling party into a secluded corner of the expansive open lounge. Curiosity gnawed at me, but I resisted the urge to follow. I decided to wait until their conversation ended. 
Turning my attention back to the party, I was approached by two assistants in Aspire Financial Group. The woman, Vivian, was a sleek blonde about Sophia's age, and the man, Derek, around his forties, exuded an air of smug self-importance. 
"Ms. Carter, how is Ms. Mitchell doing? We haven't seen her at several important gatherings lately. She hasn't been coming to the office either. There are some rumors that President Cornell is keeping her locked up," Vivian said.  
A waiter glided past with a tray of crystal flutes filled with bubbling champagne. I plucked one gracefully, using the moment to compose my thoughts. After almost a year of working closely with Sarah, I had become adept at brushing off rumors. 
Cautiously, I took a sip before responding, "I can assure you, that's nothing but baseless gossip. Sarah's been dealing with some personal matters, which is true, but she's far from being a prisoner. She's doing just fine." 
Vivian and Derek exchanged a look that set alarm bells ringing in my head. Derek cleared his throat, "Since you're the one who often handles Ms. Mitchell's business personally, it would be easy for you to steal from her. Haven't you thought of robbing her?" 
My grip on the champagne flute tightened.  
"I'm not sure I follow your meaning," I replied coolly, furrowing my brow, genuinely offended by the accusation. 
Vivian jumped in, "Oh, come now. Ms. Mitchell is young. Brilliant in some ways, perhaps, but so naïve about the real world. Rumors say she didn't finish school." 
Derek nodded confidently. "Exactly. With that much wealth, who would notice if a little... is missing?" 
A harsh laugh escaped me as I fixed them both with an icy glare. "I can't believe what I'm hearing! Do you think Sarah Mitchell is stupid? And why are you implying like I'm a thief?" I gave another sarcastic laugh. "Sarah's grandfather is an economist, surely you know that. Do you think Mr. Mitchell's granddaughter is an idiot?" 
Their smug expressions faltered, unable to meet my unwavering gaze. 
"Uhm"  
Just then, Jane re-entered the gathering, and I noticed her wiping away tears.  
What happened? 
Jane rushed past our group, eyes lowered and shoulders tense. Her obvious distress reignited my curiosity about her conversation with Bronn. 
"Excuse me," I said to Vivian and Derek. It wasn't the first time someone suggested tampering with Sarah's account. Sarah's young age made her an easy target for gossip and scheming in some people's eyes. 
Outside, where the cool night air was refreshing compared to the stuffy indoors, Bronn stood alone, his figure outlined by the garden lights. 
"Bronn, what happened?" I asked, concern evident in my voice. 
He hugged me before explaining, "It's nothing serious. Jane confessed her feelings, and I turned her down." 
I pulled back slightly, surprise etched on my face. "Confessed? You mean romantically?" 
He nodded, but I grimaced, imagining Jane's embarrassment and heartache. 
"Let's forget about Jane. Anyway, are you done with your agenda?" Bronn asked. 
"Yeah," I replied, pushing thoughts of Jane aside. 
Bronn guided me toward the event's entrance, his hand gently holding my waist. We ascended to the building's helipad to board the waiting helicopter. Bronn kissed my hand repeatedly as we boarded, seemingly forgetting about the drama with Philip's sister. 
Several minutes passed before I realized we weren't heading toward his mansion. 
After a few hours, we were dropped off at the beach house. I remembered this place. It was one of our favorites because it was quiet, and here, I felt like I was his world. 
"What are we doing here?" I asked Bronn. 
He answered with a simple smile. 
We entered, greeted by the sweet scent of roses. Gentle music accompanied the fire in the fireplace. 
"I wanted a date with just you, the two of us," he said.  
My heart fluttered at his words. We settled at a beautifully set table, where Bronn insisted on feeding me bites from each exquisite dish. Between mouthfuls, we exchanged smiles and shared our dreams for our daughter, Willow. At this moment, it felt as if the outside world had faded away, leaving only Bronn and me in our own little bubble of happiness. 
After dinner, Bronn extended his hand. "Dance with me?" 
As we swayed to the music, Bronn's expression grew serious. "Emily, I can't hold back anymore. I... I want to marry you, Emily." 
With trembling hands, he produced a small red velvet box from his pocket, and immediately, nervousness overwhelmed me. 
"I'm willing to leave everything behind just to spend the rest of my life with you and Willow..." Bronn said softly, his voice husky with emotion.  
Tears welled up in my eyes, his words resonating with the deepest longings of my heart. 
"The truth is," he continued, "my parents arranged meetings with countless women from influential families. But none of them were who I truly wanted. I was wrong before, thinking I'd made the right choice, but it never felt right. I lied to myself, convinced you weren't what I needed, but when you were gone... a part of me died." 
He paused, gently kissing my knuckles. 
"Emily, can you give me a chance? Let me speak from my heart. There's nothing I desire more than your answer..." 
His lips brushed mine in a tender kiss. 
"I'll fight anyone who tries to come between us," he vowed. "From the very beginning, that day you were eating a clubhouse sandwich in Mrs. Frost's library, you captured my heart. And yes," he added with a hint of mischief, "I wanted to fuck you from the beginning!" 
I giggled, unsure if it was a jest or sincerity, my cheeks flushed in anticipation. 
"I've wanted to kiss you every day, to wake up to your face each morning I yearned to love and fuck you for the rest of my days, Emily. So please..." Bronn finally opened the small box, revealing a large diamond ring nestled within. "Emily Carter, will you marry me?" 
My heart felt like it might burst. "Yes, absolutely!" 
Bronn's face transformed with a joy I'd never seen before; slipping the ring onto my finger. It fits perfectly, as if it had always been meant to be there. Our eyes met, and then our lips, in a kiss that felt like coming home and embarking on a new adventure all at once. 
I never imagined Bronn would one day say I was his whole world. It had always been just a dream, a fantasy I'd held close in the past.  
Bronn's hand found the zipper of my dress, slowly drawing it down. His lips traced a path from my neck to my shoulder, igniting sparks wherever they touched. When our mouths met again, it was with a deeper, more urgent passion. The room felt warmer, the world beyond its walls fading away until there was nothing but us. 
He lifted me, laying me gently on the bed, claiming me repeatedly, whispering promises and passionate declarations. 
At last, Mr. Bronn Martin, the only man I'd ever truly longed for, was officially mine. And I was his, completely and without reservation. 
*** 
**Sarah** 

Time passed unnoticed, blending days and months into a new rhythm of life. Gradually, everything settled, finding a balance I hadn't known for months.  
I began attending business events and business parties, enjoying a fulfilling relationship with Philip. Josh no longer bothered me, but at least I knew he was alive. 
Tonight, I was invited to talk about a possible partnership at an upscale club. The room buzzed with soft conversations and the sound of glasses clinking. As I looked around, I thought about the potential profits if I chose to invest here. 
"Madam Sarah, Isn't that Jane over there?" Trey pointed out, accompanying me for the evening. 
There sat Jane, alone at a table, nursing what looked like her third or fourth drink. A pang of concern shot through me.  
"Stay here," I murmured to Trey. He nodded, taking up a discreet position a few meters away as I approached my friend. 
"Hey, love!" I called out, keeping my tone light. 
"Sarah!" She seemed surprised to see me, perhaps embarrassed to be found unwinding alone in the club. 
Little did I know that night would bring unexpected danger.
###chapter 141: Betrayal Within  
**Sarah**   
"What are you doing here?" I asked Jane, my voice tinged with concern. I scanned the crowded lounge, wondering if she had come with anyone. 
"I'm alone. I heard Bronn married your executive assistant," she said sadly. 
Jane and I hadn't been in touch much lately, and I didn't realize how deeply she felt. Jakob told me that she had confessed her love to Bronn, but I hadn't grasped the gravity of the situation until now. I took Jane's hand and tried to console her. 
"Oh, love," I said softly, "Maybe it was just an infatuation. There are so many wonderful people in the world who would love you deeply." 
Her reaction was immediate and intense. 
"No, Sarah! I was in love with Bronn from the very first time you introduced him to me. He even saved me from Madam Cornell on the cruise! I worked hard to draw his character in LoveLogic because I love him!" Jane exclaimed, raising her voice. 
Studying her face, I sought signs of alcohol's influence. Her speech remained clear, yet her emotions appeared raw and unfiltered. 
"Okay, sorry. I had no idea it was so serious," I admitted.  
Jane said, her mood shifting abruptly. "I'm sorry for raising my voice Stay and drink with me!" 
Before I could stop her, she stood up and headed to the bar area. I watched her go, feeling helpless and conflicted. Since the incident with Madam Cornell, there has been an invisible barrier between us. According to Philip, there hadn't been any noticeable change in their relationship, which only added to my confusion. 
I called Trey, discreetly observing from a short distance away. 
"Find Jane's bodyguard. Also, call Philip and tell him we're here," I instructed my bodyguard. Philip and I had made plans to meet tonight, and this unexpected encounter with Jane could offer him valuable insight into her current state of mind. 
As Trey nodded and moved away to carry out my instructions, I pulled out my phone and composed a quick message to Jakob: 'Hey, are you busy? Could you please investigate the Eclipse Club Lounge for me? The owner, Arthur DeLuca, invited me here for a potential business partnership.' 
The club's location was excellent, and I couldn't help but notice the number of high-profile individuals scattered throughout the venue. It certainly seemed like a promising business opportunity. 
Jane returned after a while, carrying alcohol. 
"Let's drink!" she said. 
My first reaction was to decline Jane's offer. 
"Jane, I have a meeting scheduled with the owner of this establishment tonight," I explained. 
"Tsk! You can't because your life is so perfect," Jane whispered, her voice tinged with bitterness and envy. 
I exhaled deeply, trying to make Jane understand.  
Jane, of all people, should have understood. My life was far from perfect, and she had seen me struggle through many hardships. Yes, things had been quieter since the fake Sarah vanished, and I hadn't heard much about Josh or Mariano lately. Philip hadn't mentioned the man for a while. But that didn't mean my life was problem-free. 
"Just this once, alright?" I managed to say. 
Picking up the glass, I gulped down the margarita Jane had given me in one go. The hot liquid burned down my throat, almost making me gag. It had been a long time since I'd had alcohol, especially during months of pregnancy. The waiter approached our table. 
"Ms. Mitchell?" he inquired politely. 
Assuming he was a staff member for Arthur DeLuca, whom I was meeting tonight, I said, "Hi! I'm looking for your boss. We have a meeting scheduled for tonight." 
The waiter briefly glanced at Jane, who raised an eyebrow. 
The waiter continued, "Uh, yes! He's requesting your presence in the VIP room." 
I felt uneasy. The thought of going to a private area without my security detail made me uncomfortable. Trey hadn't returned yet to ensure my safety. 
"Love, can you come with me?" I asked Jane, hoping she'd agree. 
She frowned. "Why?" 
"I asked Trey to find your guard," I explained. 
Jane considered for a moment. "I'll tell Trey to head straight to the meeting, and you'll be back soon." 
Against my better judgment, I agreed. "Okay. Thanks!" 
As I stood up, the world around me began to spin alarmingly. I grabbed the back of my chair, struggling to maintain my balance. 
"Are you alright?" Jane asked with concern. 
No, I wasn't all right. Something was very wrong. An intense heat rapidly spread through my body, followed by a cold sweat that broke out across my skin. 
"Ms. Mitchell, are you okay?" the waiter asked, sounding worried. 
"Sorry, Sarah. Did you get dizzy from the alcohol?" Jane asked casually. "Maybe you're not used to drinking. I apologize." 
When I tried to focus on Jane's face, my vision doubled, making concentrating difficult. "Please, just accompany me to the meeting..." 
Shit! I'm wondering if this is another panic attack, but it felt different from my usual episodes. 
Jane argued, "But I haven't finished my drink yet." 
The idea that Jane might have spiked my drink was terrifying. We'd been friends for so long. But as the room kept spinning and I grew weaker, I couldn't ignore the possibility. I needed to think fast to find a way out of this situation before it was too late. 
Turning to the waiter, I managed to say, "Call your boss to come out, and we'll talk here instead." 
"Huh?" he responded, clearly caught off guard. 
I sank back into my seat, rubbing my temples, unable to sit still. With each passing moment, I could feel my energy draining away, leaving me increasingly vulnerable. 
My phone, tucked in my sling bag, buzzed. I reached for it, hoping it was Philip calling. He needs to pick me up right away! 
Instead, I instructed the waiter, "Tell your boss I'm canceling the meeting!" 
But he just stood there, unsure of what to do. I could feel he was starting to panic. 
Jane was saying something, urging me to go with the waiter and insisting that Arthur DeLuca was waiting. But her words sounded distant and distorted, like something from a dream. 
With trembling hands, I answered the call.  
"Hello!" I said, fighting to keep my eyes open. 
"Sarah, are you at the Eclipse Club Lounge?" Jakob's voice broke through. "I've been looking into it, and there's something you need to know. They've been accused of offering prostitutes to VIP clients." 
He continued, noticing my silence. "Just this week, there was a report about the club. A woman claimed she was roofied and woke up in the VIP section, believing she had been assaulted. I've been looking into it, and I think her allegations hold merit. The club provides female patrons to their clients after drvgging them. So, in my opinion, getting involved with Arthur DeLuca could be dangerous..." 
Jakob realized I wasn't responding. "Hello?" 
As Jakob spoke further, everything began to make sense: the drink, Jane acting strangely, her insistence on going to the VIP room-it all clicked into a horrifying realization. 
"Jay... Jake... help" I managed to whisper, but my voice was so weak I wasn't sure he could hear me. It was just a few words before I ran out of breath. 
Suddenly, someone grabbed my phone from my hand. Despite my blurred vision, I knew-it had to be Jane.
###chapter 142: Betrayal Within 2 
**Sarah**  
With my vision blurred, I tried to spot the person who snatched my phone. Wait why do I sense a new presence? No! 
"Hello there, Sarah, darling! It's been a while since we last saw each other," said a familiar voice-definitely not Jane's. Darkness crept at the edges of my consciousness, threatening to pull me under. I fought against it, clinging to awareness with all my willpower. 
"W-wait a moment? Is she okay?" Jane's worried voice pierced through my foggy mind. I squeezed my eyes shut even though my mind was hazy. 
"Jane, you've played your part beautifully. Why are you hesitating? Isn't this what you wanted-to separate Sarah and President Cornell? After all, didn't you blame Sarah for your unfortunate encounter with Mr. Martin? Think about it. If they split again, she'll have no choice but to rely on you. You'll be her only true friend." 
"But I... I never meant for-" Jane's voice cracked, her sobs interrupting her words. 
"Oh, come now. Deep down, you've always hated her success and happiness. It eats at you, doesn't it?" 
'Jane' I felt my heart shatter as I realized she had betrayed me. 
"Enough chit-chat. Take her to the client!" ordered Madam Olsen in her cold, confined tone. Rough hands gripped my arms, trying to lift me from the chair. 
I refused to be taken to the VIP room! My fingers found the pepper spray in my pocket. The cool metal gave me a glimmer of hope. Without hesitation, I pulled it out and aimed at the nearest blurry figure. 
"Argh! My eyes!" screamed the waiter I had spoken to earlier. 
I nearly fell but struggled to stay upright, clinging to a chair for support. Blindly, I sprayed again, sweeping my arm in a wide arc. Angry noises and swearing filled the air, my hope resting on the chaos caused to deter my attackers. 
"This customer has gone crazy!" Madam Olsen explained to the other patrons. "You there! Get her!" she ordered. 
"Get away from me!" I finally managed to shout, but it drained the last of my strength. 
Moments later, people inside the club started screaming. I heard a gunshot, and my strength ultimately gave out. Arms caught me, and I didn't know what happened next. 
*** 
**Philip** 
"Boss, something's wrong. They're blocking me from entering Eclipse Club Lounge, where Madam Sarah and I went," Trey's voice said as I spoke with him on the phone. 
"What do you mean?" I snapped, feeling a rush of icy disbelief. Trey was a seasoned bodyguard. How could he have let Sarah go into the establishment alone? 
"Miss Jane is inside alone, having drinks. Madam Sarah asked me to find your sister's guard. After I called the mansion, I found out Miss Jane had escaped. When I tried to enter, they wouldn't let me in, saying I'm not a club member," Trey explained rapidly. 
My jaw tightened. Sarah and I were supposed to meet, and a wave of dread washed over me. 
"Call the police. Now!" I ordered, ending the call abruptly. 
Without a backward glance, I abandoned the high-profile event I was attending, ignoring the startled looks of the other guests. Sprinting to my car, tires screeching as it peeled out of the parking lot, my security team hurried to follow in their vehicle. 
My phone rang again. Jakob's voice was tight and worried, "President Cornell, you must get to Sarah immediately! I just spoke with her, but something's terribly wrong. I think she's in danger at that club." 
Luckily, the prestigious club was close to where I was. Within minutes, I slammed on the brakes outside the gleaming façade.  
Trey stood at attention near the entrance, visibly restraining himself from causing a scene that might endanger Sarah further. The police arrived in response to our complaint, allowing us to enter. There was a scuffle when we were denied entry, and one of the police officers fired a shot. 
Taking advantage of the chaos, I shouldered past the stunned bouncers. Inside the pulsing lights and panicked patrons, I saw her-Sarah, staggering, her eyes not focused. I caught her before she hit the ground. 
"B-brother!" Jane's scared voice stood out amid the chaos. Trey had already informed me that my sister was there. 
My eyes narrowed on Madam Olsen as I demanded firmly, "What have you done to Sarah?" 
"Why not ask Jane instead?" the lady replied, a malicious smirk playing across her ruby-red lips. 
I glanced at Jane, who sat silently crying. I needed answers immediately. Trey approached me and scrutinized Sarah, curled up as I gathered her close. Her typically vibrant eyes were unfocused and glazed. 
"Boss, I suspect Madam Sarah might have been drvgged," Trey declared. "We have to take her to a doctor right away. Without knowing exactly what she was given, we can't afford to wait." 
It was evident that Sarah was under the influence. Jane and the people at the club would be included in the investigation. I called Ethan for help, but he couldn't leave his place, so Sarah and I went there instead. 
Upon arriving at Ethan's expansive villa, I was surprised to find Dr. Ruth already there. They immediately began tending to my wife. 
"What happened to Sarah?" my friend asked. 
"Sarah went to the Eclipse Club Lounge," I replied, my voice filled with anger. 
Dr. Ruth's expression darkened, her green eyes flashing with barely restrained anger. "That's my ex-fiancé's shameless establishment! I've seen enough cases from there to know exactly what Ms. Mitchell requires regarding IV fluids and possible antidotes." 
"Wait, your ex owns that club?" Ethan interjected. 
Dr. Ruth pressed her lips into a thin line, refusing to elaborate. Ethan respected her silence and returned his focus to Sarah. As they worked, my phone buzzed incessantly with calls and messages. After assuring myself that Sarah was in capable hands, I reluctantly prepared to leave. 
"For now, we'll monitor her closely to ensure Ms. Mitchell's safety," Dr. Ruth explained. 
Ethan added, "I've already had the medical team take blood samples from Sarah to determine what kind of drvg was administered to your wife... just in case Sarah decides to file a complaint, she'll have evidence." 
I nodded and thanked them. "Please call me immediately if there's any change. I must return to the police station to question Jane and piece together what happened tonight." 
Ethan escorted me to my car, where I decided to question him. "Since when have you had a relationship with Sarah's doctor?" 
Ethan choked. Despite knowing almost everything about Ethan's life, I was completely blindsided by this revelation about his relationship with Dr. Ruth. 
"Uh, she's pregnant, and I'm the father," he confessed. 
Wincing, the shock of this news momentarily overshadowed my concern for Sarah. "Alright! I'll find out more about this later. I need to go now." 
With a heavy heart, I drove to the police station. When I arrived, I saw my father's assistant ready to take Jane.  
In the small room, facing Jane, I unleashed all my pent-up anger. 
"Jane, how could you do this to Sarah?" I demanded. 
My sister's face crumpled, tears welling in her eyes. "B-Brother Philip, I didn't mean to- really! Madam Olsen influenced me... She convinced me it was Sarah's fault I was in this situation. That it's her fault Emily and Bronn met or that I met that guy. I tried to stay away from Sarah because I was so jealous of her..." 
Jane's voice broke as she continued, "At least when you two separated, I could talk to you. You were there. Why did Sarah get to be happy and leave me behind? We both suffered because of Madam Cornell, but you had her by your side while I was left hurting." 
I stared at her, bewildered and disbelieving.  
"Jane, admit it. You never wanted Sarah to be happy from the start, did you? Now it all makes sense! You didn't tell me Sarah was pregnant back then. You even told Mom about Dr. Morgan and hid about the medication Sarah was taking. From the very beginning, you only wanted Sarah to suffer!" 
My sister sobbed uncontrollably, her body shaking with each breath. I felt my anger give way to a deep, aching disappointment. 
"I can't believe you!" I exclaimed, my voice rising. "Sarah risked her life to save you on that cruise, even though she knew it could endanger our children!" 
Jane froze, her sobs quieting. It seemed like sanity was slowly returning to her. 
"Sarah has only ever wished for your happiness," I continued, "but you seem to wish her nothing but misery. Do you think she'll ever trust you again after this? Or even me, for that matter?"  
I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what I had to say next.  
"I'm sorry, Jane, but I can't allow you near my wife or my children anymore."
###chapter 143: Façade of Friendship 
**Sarah**  
Faint voices could be heard upon regaining consciousness. A sharp pain throbbed at my temples, and I felt weak all over.  
As my senses returned, I struggled to recall my last clear memories. Jane's face came into focus-she had handed me a drink. I was sure she had something to do with what happened to me. 
Blinking away the lingering haze, I looked around. The luxurious décor and familiar layout reminded me that this was Ethan Vanderbilt's house. Philip had brought me here months ago. 
"That lunatic! I couldn't believe that scumbag!" I heard Dr. Ruth exclaim outside the room. 
"Ruth, please, you need to calm down. This level of stress isn't good for you or the baby," came the voice of Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt. 
'Baby? Is Dr. Ruth pregnant?' 
Summoning my remaining strength, I pushed myself up and staggered towards the door. As I opened it, both doctors spun around, their wide eyes and slightly open mouths revealing their surprise. 
"Hi! Uh, h-how did I get here?" I asked them. And why is Dr. Ruth here? But I kept the last question to myself. 
"Sarah! It's good to see you awake. Just a moment; I need to call your husband and let him know," said Ethan. He walked away before I could respond. 
"Hang on. Did something happen to me?" Fear gripped me as I looked at Dr. Ruth. Is that why I was left here? 
Dr. Ruth's expression softened, a reassuring smile spreading across her face.  
"No, no, nothing like that," she soothed. "Your husband just went to take care of the incident at the Eclipse Club Lounge. He entrusted you to us because he also needed to attend to Iris and Rowan," explained Dr. Ruth with a broad smile. "Anyway, come on, you must be famished. The drvg you were given can have that effect. Let's get some food in you."  
She led me to the kitchen, clearly at home in Ethan's house. Her ease with the layout and effortless finding of everything made me wonder. It's obvious! The two are having an affair! 
She gave me some milk, bread, and bacon. 
"Please don't take this the wrong way, but why did you go to Arthur's club?" Dr. Ruth inquired. 
"Arthur?" I repeated the name she mentioned. For the doctor to speak of the club owner this way, they must know each other. 
"Arthur is my ex-scumbag fiancé!" 
"Oh!" My mouth formed an O. "He invited me to his business establishment for a possible business partnership, but now, I don't think that was the real reason at all. While I was... under the influence, I heard my aunt's voice. I think they're all in this together." 
"Aunt? Do you mean Madam Olsen?" Dr. Ruth asked. 
"Yes. It seems you know quite a lot, Dr. Ruth," I couldn't help but remark. 
Dr. Ruth elaborated, "Arthur and I... we have a history. We were college friends back in Nashville and started dating about ten years ago. Five years ago, he proposed, and I accepted like a fool. With marriage plans in mind, I invested nearly all my earnings from my medical practice into his club. He always said it was his dream, that it would make us rich..." 
Dr. Ruth's voice faded as she absentmindedly traced patterns on the kitchen table. 
"I noticed gradual changes in our lives-from a modest apartment to a penthouse. However, our dream of starting a family seemed to disappear in exchange. For five years, he made excuses until I discovered that the engagement ring he gave me was intended for another woman!" 
Her expression hardened, jaw clenching.  
"Three months ago, I had a patient who became pregnant after visiting Arthur's club. Suspicious of his lies and sharing a roof with him, I obtained documents from his safe-the identity of the club's major investor, even details about the drugs they use to victimize patrons. It was like a house of cards collapsing around me." 
Listening intently, I couldn't help but empathize with Dr. Ruth as she recounted her story. 
"Madam Cornell is his primary investor. So when President Cornell informed me last night about what happened to you and where he rescued you, I knew immediately how to proceed with your treatment." 
"Thank you, Dr. Ruth!" I wondered if Arthur DeLuca was the father of her unborn child, but I couldn't ask-it felt too personal, too raw. 
"Imagine, I was blinded by that lunatic for ten years! The woman he was truly planning to marry had followed him here in Highland Hills. I discovered he'd been housing her for months, right under my nose. Without hesitation, I ended things with him!" 
She took a deep breath, composing herself. "But even now, that shameless man won't leave me in peace. He blames me whenever something goes wrong in his club, like last night... I only realized his manipulative ways and deception after he disappeared from my life." 
After Dr. Ruth shared her story, I realized everyone seemed to have their own deep, often painful narrative.  
"Dr. Ruth, you mentioned seeing those documents. Is there any way we could get copies?" A fire of determination had ignited within me. "I can't allow a club like that to continue operating in this city, wreaking havoc on women's lives. Their evil needs to end." 
I need to teach Madam Olsen a lesson! I can't understand why she would want to hurt me. 
"Actually, yes. They're all on my cell phone, locked away in my safe. When I discovered those documents, I immediately photographed everything, thinking they might be needed someday." She gave a wry smile. "I guess that day has come sooner than expected." 
"Dr. Ruth, I can't thank you enough for this," I said, squeezing her hand. 
"It's nothing... It's time to shut down that club." 
Then, I explained why I had been at the Eclipse Club Lounge. I was saddened that I had nearly become a victim the previous night. 
Philip's car arrived to pick me up a few minutes later. 
Once inside, I immediately told him where I wanted to go. "I miss Iris and Rowan, but I need to talk to Jane right now." 
Philip was surprised. He started to protest, but he saw the determination in my eyes. 
With a slight nod, he instructed the driver, "Take us to Cornell Mansion." 
As the car pulled away, I fell into a heavy silence. The weight of betrayal pressed down on me, threatening to crush my spirit.  
Jane's betrayal hurt most those who could have turned against me. For the three years of my marriage, I trusted her as a friend amidst the challenges with Philip. In one night, she shattered that trust completely. 
When we arrived at the mansion, Philip turned to me, concern etched on his face.  
"What's your plan, Sarah?" 
"Philip, I'm used to betrayal by now, but Jane? I was nearly molested last night because of her actions." My voice cracked slightly, but I pressed on. "This won't be easy, but I need to confront her. I have to cut her out of my life completely..."
###chapter 144: Serpent's Kiss 
**Jane**  
A strange tightness gripped my chest as I sat by the window in my bedroom, looking out at the neatly trimmed gardens below. I haven't been able to think clearly since last night. Madam Cornell manipulated me in the past, and I couldn't believe I was still falling for it now under Madam Olsen's influence. It left a bitter taste in my mouth. 
I hate Sarah as much as I love her. 
A sudden knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. Quickly, I wiped my eyes with a lace-edged handkerchief, trying to hide any trace of tears. Taking a deep breath to compose myself, I walked over and opened the door. 
Shock and fear must have been written all over my face. 
"Sarah" 
The butler cleared his throat. "Miss Jane, Madam Sarah wishes to speak with you. Were you available at that moment?" 
My first instinct was to refuse, to slam the door and retreat into my solitude. But I knew I had no right to deny her this conversation. Sarah deserved answers, and it was my chance to voice the doubts that had plagued me. With a slight nod, I stepped back, allowing Sarah to enter. 
When we were alone, she began to speak, "Jane, have I done something wrong to you? To hurt you in some way?" 
I didn't expect her voice to crack. 
"On my way here, I was thinking carefully about whether I had done anything to deserve what you did to me." 
I remembered what Madam Olsen had said-that Sarah had made a fool of me. My friend pretended to be ignorant and weak, making it seem like she gave up studying in London when, in truth, she wanted to marry Philip. Sarah wanted me to feel indebted to her, but she was laughing at me because I still relied on the Cornell name. 
After reflecting on Madam Olsen's words, I stared intently at Sarah. 
"Madam Olsen urged me to do it. She told me you were going to the club and said it was the perfect chance to create a rift between you and Brother Philip!" I explained. 
"But why, Jane? What wrong have I done to you?" Sarah asked, her brow furrowed. 
"You're the reason I'm in this mess! Madam Cornell abducted me because of you!" Tears streamed down my cheeks, hot and unstoppable. "Do you know she blamed you every time she hurt me? I hold you accountable for everything I've suffered because she wouldn't have targeted me if you were here in Highland Hills that day!" 
My chest heaved as I gasped for breath, words pouring out like a floodgate had opened. 
"You were hiding in Dubai while Brother Philip lay in a coma. Madam Cornell used me as a pawn in her game to lure you back to the city. And now? Look at the mess left behind. The Cornell family is falling apart, and my reputation is ruined. But you?" 
My words were bitter as I kept going, unable to hold back the flood of accusations. "You've got a perfect family, a great career, and your name shining in the industry. It seems like you're living a charmed life, doesn't it? Everything falls into place for Sarah Cornell in the end, doesn't it?" 
My chest tightened with pain. Sarah left me hanging. I thought we were in this together. I continued, my voice trembling. 
"You introduced me to Bronn! I created him in my dreams while I designed his non-player character. Bronn came to life in my imagination, my constant companion. He was everything to me, Sarah. Everything! And now I find out he was just another lie, another betrayal. How could you let me fall so deep into that fantasy?" 
Sarah spoke, disbelief in her voice. 
"I wish you'd told me you felt this way! Maybe it's my fault for letting you stay at Amir's mansion. I thought we'd progress together, Jane... My life hasn't been easy, you know that! You've seen the panic attacks and the mental health struggles that threaten to drown me. And the grief... God, the grief of losing my first child with Philip. It's a wound that never fully heals." 
I paused, surprised by the intense pain in Sarah's voice. Despite my anger, it was difficult to see her cry and to witness the pain on her face. 
"You, more than anyone, know if I've been happy... Jane, I included you in every prayer, in every wish I made. All I wanted was for you to be happy, too. I fought hard to find my own happiness, but my relationship with Philip and my family is far from perfect..." 
She gazed at me, her eyes red and full of pleading. "I never expected you to betray me like you did last night. Of all the people in this world who could have stabbed me in the back, you were the absolute last one I would have ever suspected." 
"During my first marriage with Philip, during my darkest moments when I felt like giving up, you were my anchor. I loved you not just as a friend but as the sister I never had But what you did last night... it didn't just hurt me, it shattered my heart into a million pieces." 
Sarah took a deep, shaky breath before continuing, her words heavy with finality.  
"I tried to understand, to make sense of your actions, but I have to cut you out of my life It's not just about me anymore, and I have children who need protection."  
As Sarah moved towards the door, tears streamed down both our faces. The pain in her chest was palpable, mirroring the ache in my own heart. I could feel the weight of my betrayal, the irreparable damage I'd caused to our bond. 
I felt her final severing of ties with me. I tried calling Sarah for forgiveness, but I think she blocked me. 
Later that night, Dad summoned me to the dining table, clearly upset about the situation. Our family had just started to recover from the Madam Cornell scandal, and now we were thrown back into crisis. 
Brother Philip had been tirelessly protecting my name, but if Sarah filed a complaint against the club, his efforts might not be enough to keep me safe. Dad surprised me with an announcement. 
"The board has decided to remove you from the office... Jane, I don't know what else to do. I've done what I could. I'm sending you to London immediately while we attempt to salvage your reputation here." 
I bit my lower lip, fighting back tears as the reality of the situation sank in. 
Dad's gaze met mine. "You've received a marriage proposal from the Martin Family." 
I was taken aback. 
'But why London? Isn't Bronn's family in Nevada? And isn't he already married to Sarah's executive assistant?' I kept my questions to myself. At this point, I couldn't complain; I couldn't ask. 
Three days later, I met the person I would marry. 
Uncertain about what lay ahead, I instantly fell in love with him-a love that felt genuine from the moment our eyes met. 
I hope this isn't merely another dream...
###chapter 145: In Their Genes 
**Sarah**  
***Four years later...*** 
At the Serenity Pines library, I am holding an invitation from my father for his sixtieth birthday.  
Over the past four years, we had only met at a few business events, each one formal and filled with unspoken feelings. This gathering felt different. There were rumors that Father might announce the transfer of TerraTraxx Automotive's chairmanship to Amir, which would change the company's future. 
"Mommy!" I heard Rowan cry out. 
I went to the door to see what the commotion was about. As I opened it, I found my son with tears streaming down his chubby cheeks, his tiny body shaking with each sob. 
"Mommy, Iris ate my favorite snack. She finished all the cheese headstrings that were for me!" He cried even harder. 
Kneeling, I wiped his tears away with my thumb while my thoughts were consumed with the implications-Iris's tendency to overeat frequently led to stomachaches, causing me concern.  
Holding Rowan's small, warm hand in mine, I called out, "Iris!" 
Then, a small voice piped up from behind the plush leather sofa.  
"She's... she's not here anymore!" 
I held back a smile, impressed by my daughter's cute behavior. "Oh, Rowan," I said, looking into my son's tearful eyes, "where do you think Iris went?" 
Their different personalities always amazed me. With his thoughtful and quiet nature, Rowan was so much like his father. His sandy hair and wise eyes made him seem mature for his age. Iris, however, was full of mischief and charm. Her dark brown curls and playful grin made me think of Philip's comment about her taking after me-a comparison I wasn't sure how to handle. 
"Iris, she she went to her boyfriend!" came the small voice again from behind the sofa. 
I raised an eyebrow, suppressing a chuckle as Rowan dashed around the sofa, forgetting his earlier distress as he eagerly unveiled his sister's hiding spot. 
Iris angrily scolded him. "Hey! Mommy will find me! Why are you so annoying?" 
"You can't have a boyfriend! You're too small! Grandpa Mitchell will scold you, and Daddy will scold me, too!" Rowan countered. 
Iris came out of her hiding spot, her messy curls framing her face and her eyes full of defiance. "Mommy, Rowan is bothering me!" She pouted and faked tears. "Mommy, Rowan is being bad!" 
I crossed my arms. "Come here, both of you," I said, gesturing to the sofa. "Sit down, please." 
They obeyed and scrambled onto the leather couch. Iris's legs dangled, not quite reaching the floor, while Rowan sat up straight with his hands folded in his lap. 
"Tell me, Iris, what did you do wrong to Rowan?" I asked. 
Her lips parted as she launched her defense. "I didn't do anything wrong to Rowan. I saw his snack in the fridge! It's all the snack's fault because it was there waiting for me to eat it. Mommy, it's not my fault! It should be the snack's or Rowan's fault!" 
"But it's mine! You finished yours yesterday!" Rowan said. 
Iris's cheeks puffed up like a chipmunk's. "I am your baby sister! You shouldn't be stingy with me! I'll tell Daddy that you were mean to me! And when I ask him to buy me more snacks, I won't share any with you!" 
Rowan cried. "But he's my daddy too!" His voice cracking like he'd just lost his father's love. 
I felt a dull ache behind my eyes as I watched my kids' antics. Their argument left me both amused and frustrated. Iris had clearly inherited her father's knack for twisting stories, making Rowan look like the troublemaker in their fights. 
Taking a deep breath, I addressed them both. "Alright, you two. I asked what the mistake was. Iris, you know eating too many snacks is not good, right? If you saw Daddy's beer in the fridge, would you drink it?" 
Iris wrinkled her nose in disgust. "No! I don't like beer! Cheese sticks are different; they're yummy!" she argued, her reasoning clear in its simple, childlike way. 
I was momentarily struck dumb by her reasoning. Gathering my wits, I instructed, "Apologize to your brother Rowan." 
My daughter pouted, clearly stubborn and unwilling to give in.  
Recognizing the need for leverage, I added, "If you don't apologize, we're not leaving Serenity Pines. We won't be going to Daddy's office." 
"Sorry!" they chorused instantly, their eyes wide with alarm. 
"I want to go to Daddy's office, Mommy!" Iris pleaded. 
"Me too!" Rowan chimed in. 
Settling into the single armchair, I fixed them with a stern gaze. "Then you need to show me that you can be kind to each other." 
"Brother, I'm sorry! Mommy, I'm sorry too! Iris will listen to Brother Rowan and won't eat Rowan's snacks anymore!" Iris said, her head bowed. 
Rowan, always the peacemaker, said, "Iris, I'm sorry for scolding you..." 
"Listen carefully, both of you," I said firmly. "No snacks for one week, okay? We'll focus on eating fruits and vegetables." 
Rowan's face fell. "B-but what about my cheese headstrings?"  
"What if I replace it with a car toy?"  
His face lit up. "Yes, yes, yes! I want that, Mommy!" He began bouncing on the sofa. Iris joined him, and their faces were full of cheer. Rowan had clearly inherited our family's passion for automobiles. 
Amir is sending Rowan a toy car-a scaled-down sports car model. It resembles the new TerraTraxx sports car model, but its engine is simple enough to be rolled around on the balcony of Serenity Pines Estate. 
Since they apologized, I took them to Philip's office. This will be our second visit because Amanda and Pepper are in Dubai due to my grandfather's illness. 
Philip and I had agreed to share custody of the twins, and neither of us was comfortable leaving them with others. I had a meeting in Henderson that afternoon, so the plan was to drop the children off at Luminary Productions beforehand. 
As we entered Philip's office floor's elevator lobby, I noticed a strikingly beautiful young celebrity waiting. We didn't pay much attention; seeing people like her is common on Philip's office floor. 
"M-Madam Sarah!" Alex's greeting carried a hint of nervousness that gave me pause. 
"Hi! Is your boss around?" I inquired, studying his face for any sign of trouble. 
I couldn't read Alex's expression. Did Philip do something? Nervously, I opened the door and was stunned to see Jane sitting in front of Philip's desk.
###chapter 146: New Dynamic 
**Jane** 
Seeking my brother Philip's advice, I came to Highland Hills, desperate for his support during this difficult time. 
For four years, I managed the modeling agency, a sub-company of Luminary Productions in London and Paris. Alongside my career, I continued therapy to address my past traumas. The weekly sessions, though often painful, have gradually cleared my mind. To atone for what I did to Sarah, I devoted myself to my work. 
My marriage to Brody Martin has been nothing more than a well-orchestrated charade-a typically arranged marriage designed to benefit our families rather than our hearts. He owns a chemical empire and is a cousin of the brothers Bronn and Jakob. 
Philip spoke after hearing my story. "You mean to say, after you returned from Paris, you found your husband in the apartment at The Strata with his secretary? And at that moment, you decided to end your four-year marriage? Now you're here, asking me to break the news to Dad that your marriage with Brody didn't work out?" 
I pressed my lips together, fighting back tears. "That's right. Brother, I don't think Brody loves me." 
When Brody was first introduced to me, he was naturally cold towards me. His striking resemblance to Bronn, a man I once yearned for, initially clouded my judgment. Our relationship was fine, in the sense that we both played our roles in the family and marriage. 
"Brody has been taking care of me as his wife for the last four years. I feel the respect we have for each other. But all that ended when the woman he was supposed to marry entered the picture. She's been a secretary in Brody's office for four months." 
I paused, gathering strength. "You know I've had a bad history in the past. The best option for me is to accept that my marriage isn't working and then move on." 
I don't want a life wasted; tired of waiting for love, tired of loving without reciprocation. Brother Philip looked at me intently. I don't know if he's surprised by my behavior. 
After finishing my therapy and focusing on work, I had a realization. I'd spent four years fooling myself into thinking that Brody and I were building a life together. I clung to the fantasy that our arranged marriage would become a fairytale romance. 
"Jane, I feel like you've been through a similar situation with Sarah before," Brother Philip remarked. 
At the mention of his wife, whom I hadn't seen since my wedding abroad, I pressed my lips together and bowed my head, feeling a rush of shame and the weight of my past mistakes. 
Philip continued, his tone gentle but probing, "Is it possible you're misinterpreting the situation with Brody's secretary because you know she's his ex?" 
Was I jumping to conclusions?  
All I knew was that the secretary had sent me multiple messages and frequently told me to stay away from my husband, reminding me that our connection was only contractual. 
"I... I'm not sure, Philip," I admitted. "But I can't shake this unease about his secretary. Our arguments have become more frequent and more intense. This trip back from Paris is my last resort. Why else would she be in our apartment if there wasn't something between them? If I hadn't arrived that night... God, I don't even want to imagine what might have happened. A cheating husband is the last thing I need in my life!" 
My chest tightened, and tears nearly spilled. I took a deep breath, trying to control my emotions. 
The memory of that night with Brody was still painful. I hadn't even unpacked my suitcase; I took it straight to Highland Hills after telling Brody we needed to separate. His hurt and betrayal haunted me, but what ate at me was the doubt in my heart. 
Suddenly, the door flew open, breaking my troubled thoughts. I looked over, and my gaze met Sarah's. 
"Daddy!" The little girl ran over first, followed closely by the boy with a flushed face. Brother Philip hugged both of them lightly and simultaneously. 
"I miss you, Daddy!" said the girl. 
Sarah entered Philip's office with a neutral expression but fixed her gaze on me. 
The boy, eyes wide with curiosity, asked, "Who is she, Daddy?" 
Sarah was the one who answered, "She's your Auntie Jane." 
"Oh, oh, I know!" the girl chirped excitedly to her twin. "She's Daddy's sister!"  
"Hello, Auntie Jane!" they both exclaimed. 
I wanted to cry seeing their happy family. I admit I'm still envious of them. But maybe that's normal, right? 
"They're absolutely adorable, Brother Philip," I managed with a forced smile. "Anyway, I... I should go." 
The unspoken tension between Sarah and me made every breath feel difficult. I didn't want to interrupt their family time, and I wasn't sure I could stay composed around Sarah after she ended our relationship. 
Leaving Philip's office, I spotted Alex, who had been working for my brother for years. 
"Ms. Jane," he began, his voice hesitant, "your husband is waiting for you in the lobby." 
My expression instantly soured. "How did he find me here?" I hissed, panic rising in my chest. "Get rid of him, Alex. Tell him I'm not here!" 
I was exhausted, and the idea of facing Brody, going over our arguments and the pain of betrayal, was too much to handle. I sank into Alex's chair outside Philip's office and closed my eyes, trying to escape the harsh reality. 
A moment later, the phone's sharp ring startled me. My heart raced, worried it might be Brody. Alex answered it on speakerphone, and it turned out to be a staff member. 
"Boss Alex, Madam Sarah's ride is here upstairs. Could you let her know, please?" 
My eyes snapped open, and my curiosity piqued. I was unable to mask my surprise. "Is Sarah taking a helicopter?" 
"Yes," Alex confirmed. "She has a meeting in Henderson this afternoon. Given her limited time with her job, Boss Philip, and the twins, the helicopter is the most efficient option." 
A lightbulb went off in my head: air transport was the perfect way to avoid running into Brody. My mind raced with possibilities. 
When Sarah emerged from Philip's office, I stood up abruptly, our eyes locking in a moment of mutual surprise. She clearly hadn't expected to find me still lingering in the outer office.  
Summoning my courage, I asked, "Sarah, c-can I come with you?"
###chapter 147: Silent Struggles 
**Sarah**  
As Jane exited Philip's room, I was at a loss for how to react.  
There was something different about her that I couldn't quite pinpoint, but it left me feeling unsettled. Seeking a moment to process my thoughts, I moved to the large floor-to-ceiling window. I left Philip with the children, still feeling uneasy from my brief interaction with Jane. 
Jane had always held a special place in my heart, and realizing we had grown distant over the past four years disturbed me deeply. 
"Here's a coloring book for each of you. Whoever does the best job coloring gets a special prize from Daddy. How does that sound?" I heard Philip say. 
Iris's voice piped up eagerly, "Me, me! I'm definitely going to win! I'm way better at coloring than Brother Rowan!" 
"No way, Iris! Your coloring is always messy and all over the place!" Rowan immediately retorted. 
"Okay, we'll see about that later!" Philip responded. 
It wasn't until I felt Philip's warm embrace from behind that I snapped back to reality. Turning my head, I saw Rowan and Iris wholly absorbed in their coloring books at Philip's desk. 
"Are you troubled by Jane's visit?" Philip asked. 
"How is she?" I asked simply. 
"To be honest, I'm unsure if I can say she's okay. Jane's gone through significant changes after therapy. I thought she and Brody Martin had no problems, but" He trailed off. 
"But what?" I prompted. 
"When Jane returned from Paris, she found Brody's secretary in their apartment. As it turns out, this woman is actually Brody's ex-fiancée." His face soured as he relayed this information, clearly disapproving of the situation. 
"He's cheating?" My eyes widened in shock.  
"I'm not sure, babe. I can't answer what Brody truly feels or how he's acted towards Jane. It's possible there's an explanation for why the secretary was at their place that doesn't involve infidelity." 
I raised an eyebrow at Philip. "Are you defending a cheater?" 
Philip grimaced at my accusation and reasoned, "Come on, I'm just saying it's possible! Remember when you thought I had something going on with Megan before, even though I ended any thoughts of her before we married? What I had with Megan after she returned was purely professional, nothing more." 
"That's exactly what you told me about us, too, Philip. That what we had was 'purely business.'" I commented, raising an eyebrow. 
Philip scratched his head. 
"Hmp!" 
Our conversation was cut short when my ride was announced. 
"Bye, babies! Be good to Daddy, okay?" 
"Bye, Mommy!" my two kids said. Philip managed to steal a quick kiss before I left the room, his lips brushing mine with an urgent tenderness. As I stepped out, my heart skipped a beat. There, waiting outside, was Jane. 
*** 
**Jane** 
The trip to Henderson was unusually silent between Sarah and me. For over two hours, we hardly spoke because of the helicopter's noise. Exhausted, I fell asleep without even realizing it. 
I was jolted awake as the helicopter began to land. When I looked around, I saw a familiar logo and realized we were landing at BM Technologies. I mentally kicked myself for not thinking ahead.  
Damn it! Why had I assumed Sarah was going somewhere else? 
We were greeted by her executive assistant, Emily, who looked just as surprised to see me. I offered a smile, which she returned. Since we're part of the same family, it's not unusual for us to run into each other at family gatherings, though my relationship with her and Bronn is a casual familiarity. 
I was about to part ways with Sarah's group when I suddenly realized I had no money. Crap! In my haste to escape Brody's presence, I had left everything behind-including my wallet. I had no cash, no cards, nothing. 
As we waited for the elevator, I gathered my courage and gently tapped Sarah on the shoulder. 
"Hey, I know this is incredibly awkward, but can I borrow some money?" I asked, whispering and blushing from embarrassment. Emily and two other assistants were nearby, glancing over at us. "I promise I'll repay you when I return to Highland Hills." 
"Why?" Sarah asked, looking puzzled. 
I scratched my cheek nervously, feeling increasingly foolish. 
"I... I didn't think things through today. I literally had nothing with me except my phone, which was in my pocket. I drove to Luminary Productions and left my bag in the car, thinking I'd only be in Philip's office for a minute. But, well..." 
Sarah's intense gaze bore into me, clearly struggling to understand my lapse in judgment. 
"I know, I know," I continued, desperate to explain myself. "I was impulsive. Please?" 
Sarah sighed long and then said, "I'll help you out. But in return, I need your assistance with something." 
My brow furrowed.  
"A new game app is launching today, and I'm one of the judges for the projects submitted for investment. I need your expertise to ensure my choices are sound and unbiased. Could you analyze each submission and point out potential design flaws or technical execution? I'll pay you afterward." 
The idea intrigued me. It seemed like a good distraction from my chaotic thoughts. Why not? I thought. I missed Sarah's company and was eager to spend time with her, even if it was just a short, professional visit. 
Jakob looked surprised when he saw me approaching the conference hall and then hugged me.  
"Jane? Wow! My dear cousin! Have you and Sarah patched things up?" He was grinning like a fool. 
I grimaced and didn't respond to his comment. 
Jakob didn't let my silence stop him. "Did you know that Brody had me looking for you? Good thing you're here! Now I won't have to struggle with my answer!" 
A warning glance was shot his way, silently urging him to drop the subject. 
"Jake! Leave her alone," Emily said sharply. 
"What? I was just-" he began, but Sarah interrupted. 
"Jane looks uncomfortable. Can't you see?" Sarah scolded her friend.  
"You and Brody fought?!" Jakob exclaimed. 
"Why don't you go on inside and leave her be?" Sarah kicked him to create some distance. 
"P-please don't mind him," Emily said, trying to defuse the situation. 
"You know how he gets when he's excited-his mouth runs faster than his brain. I swear, that man must have taken a double dose of his vitamins this morning!" Sarah remarked with a hint of sarcasm. 
"Th-thanks, ladies!" I managed to stammer, feeling a lump in my throat, fighting my tears. Their instinctive protection of my mental state, even after everything that had happened, touched me deeply. 
Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself as we entered the conference hall. 
Bronn stood at the podium, his charismatic presence commanding attention. Watching him speak, I realized my feelings for him were just infatuation-an overblown gratitude for his perceived rescue from Madam Cornell. It was merely a fantasy, a way to escape my harsh reality. 
"Games have evolved from mere entertainment to powerful tools over the years. They've made learning more engaging Games also foster connections, bringing people together in virtual worlds where individuals from diverse locations can meet, play, and collaborate" 
His presence stirred thoughts of Brody, causing a pang in my chest. Our four-year marriage wasn't perfect, but it wasn't terrible either. He had treated me well as a Cornell. 
So, what went wrong with my marriage? 
"To all our brilliant engineers, thank you for your invaluable contributions, eagerness to share your knowledge, and always wanting to learn more. Your dedication motivates us to aim higher and be more innovative..." 
Applause filled the room. I pushed thoughts of Brody aside and joined Jakob and Sarah in rating the game apps presented. 
After the event, I thought we would return to Highland Hills, but Emily and Bronn invited Sarah and me to their place for a gathering. 
At their mansion, I had a chance to talk more deeply with Sarah.  
The following day, I woke up to find Brody sleeping beside me and screamed in surprise!
###chapter 148: Years of Silence 
**Jane**  
A deep sadness filled my chest as I joined Sarah's team at Emily and Bronn's cozy home. The smell of Emily's barbecue was in the air, but it did little to lift my mood. I wandered to a quiet spot in their garden, away from the lively conversations. 
I sat quietly in the garden, drinking beer alone while reflecting on the four years of my life that Brody had taken over. 
The sound of grass rustling signaled Sarah's approach. Once comforting and familiar, her presence now brought a mix of longing and nervousness. 
"Can I talk to you?" she asked. 
I nodded. Part of me wanted to know if she still resented me, but another part feared the answer. 
Sarah began speaking while staring off into the distance. "Did you know I deliberately ensured our paths wouldn't cross for four years? I... I didn't know how to face you." 
I pressed my lips together, absorbing her words. A moment of clarity hit me. Why was I still afraid of Sarah's judgment when I was the one who had destroyed the beautiful relationship we once had? 
"I felt the same way," I confessed, my voice hoarse with emotion. I took a long swig of beer, hoping it would steady my nerves. 
"I felt like I had no right to show my face to you... Sarah, I was utterly broken four years ago. You witnessed firsthand how Madam Cornell manipulated and mentally abused me... When Bronn came along and rescued me from that situation, I saw him as my savior. I poured all my misguided fantasies and desperation for love onto him..." 
I couldn't hold back the tears any longer. They streamed down my face, hot and relentless, like the guilt that had plagued me for years. 
"I don't want to make excuses or justify my actions. I... I want you to know I've missed you terribly, Sarah" A sob escaped me, and I struggled to regain composure. "You probably know how many times I tried to end my life I felt so utterly alone and unlovable. But when I look back, you were always there for me. You were often the first to show your love and support whenever something happened to me... And I repaid that kindness by submitting to my demons, causing you to leave my life..." 
I wiped my tears with the back of my hand. "After our last encounter, I still thought about ending my life. Nightmares tormented me, and I felt like everything was pointless. But just before I could act on those dark thoughts, I realized that even in the end, I was being selfish Wasn't I meant to suffer for what I had done? Wasn't this pain my punishment? I was so broken, Sarah" 
Sarah enveloped me in a tight embrace, and I felt the warmth of a friendship I thought I'd lost forever. Her gentle hands wiped the tears from my cheeks as she shed her own silent tears.  
"I'm jealous of you, that's true. I've wronged you so deeply, yet fate has been inexplicably kind to me. I married a wealthy man and was given opportunities to work abroad..." I murmured, looking down. 
"Philip mentioned that you and your husband are having problems?" 
I nodded. 
"Do you love him?" she asked. 
"Yes." It's natural for me to love Brody, not because he resembles Bronn, who was my first interest. "Over the past four years, I've felt Brody's respect. He's been attentive, bringing me flowers on our anniversaries and gifts for various occasions. But..." I paused, struggling to articulate my feelings. "I've realized that he sees me as a wife, nothing more." 
I took a deep breath. 
"What I want is a family, Sarah Madam Cornell took away the chance for me to have that. But for Brody, all he needs is a wife on paper-a person to be intimate with in bed." 
Sarah listened intently, her silence encouraging me to continue. Her patience allowed me to express my frustrations freely, without fear of judgment. 
"For months now, I've been troubled by Brody's secretary. I tried to convince myself that I shouldn't have any problems with her. Brody treated me well, making it easy to ignore what was happening. But last month, I discovered something even more shocking about their past-they were essentially in an open relationship." 
Sarah looked stunned. "You mean Brody was seeing other people? Or was it the woman who had other relationships?" Her brow furrowed with concern. "But surely, that's not the state of your current relationship with him, right?" 
"No, Sarah! Of course not!" I exclaimed, horrified at the thought. I don't want another complication in my life. Even though my relationship with Brody might be casual in some ways, the idea that he might be with another woman... it's like poison to my mind. 
"That's why I couldn't relax for a whole month after I found out, and I threw myself into work. The woman was the one who introduced him to that kind of... open relationship." 
I met Sarah's concerned gaze. 
"God, Sarah, after I discovered Brody had been in such a relationship before, I rushed to the hospital to get tested for every possible infection. That's how paranoid I became! 
"When I returned from Paris, where I was managing Luminary Productions' modeling agency, I was stunned to find his ex in our apartment. Of course, It's only natural that I assumed the worst. I was so shocked that I immediately said I wanted a divorce!" 
"Sarah, I'm set on this. I can't deal with any more emotional stress. Loving someone who doesn't respect you is just too draining." 
"Since his ex showed up, it's been clear she's got his attention, so I decided to step back. After everything I've been through, I need to protect my mental health at all costs..." I took another swig of beer, wincing from the pain. 
My mind drifted back to that scene, seeing the secretary there, relaxed in what should have been my space. 
*** 
My tired smile appeared in the shiny elevator doors as I headed to our penthouse apartment. Finally, after weeks apart, I was about to see Brody. He'd been texting me every day from Paris, constantly checking how I was doing. 
I glanced at my phone screen again, re-reading his latest message: "I miss you, wifey. Please finish up your work and come home soon." 
Right now, he's the only person I wanted to see. The familiar space came into view as the elevator doors opened on our apartment floor. Everything seemed normal at first, except for the two people standing frozen in the middle of the room. 
Brody had his hands on Sonia's shoulders. The cheeky woman was wearing my favorite silk nightgown. My husband was still in his tailored three-piece suit, his tie loosened and hair slightly disheveled. I couldn't stop the ugly thoughts racing through my mind.  
Did they plan to spend the night together because they thought I wouldn't be home?  
Had this happened before while I was away? Was this a one-time mistake or an ongoing affair? 
"What is going on here?" I couldn't help but ask. 
Brody's eyes widened in shock. 
He's cheating! I can't take this anymore! 
"Brody, I want a divorce!" I declared, my voice steady despite the storm inside me. Fortunately, the elevator was still there, waiting for me like a gleaming escape pod. 
I stepped back into the elevator, pressing the lobby button with shaking fingers. As the doors closed on Brody's stunned face, I took one last look at our life together
###chapter 149: Other Woman 
**Jane** 
Before I got into the yellow taxi, Brody managed to catch up with me, wearing house slippers as he followed me. 
"Jane!" He grabbed my arm, his fingers trembling slightly. "Please, don't go," he panted, his green eyes wide with panic. 
"I can't take this anymore, Brody! I've ignored the office rumors, the glances, and your 'work dinners' with Sonia. But finding her in our home, wearing my clothes? This is too much!" I shouted angrily. 
He glanced around at the people staring at us, clearly uncomfortable with the public scene.  
"Jane, please, let's not create a scene. We can talk about this at home," he said, which further fueled my anger. 
"If you don't want a scene, return to the penthouse and leave me alone!" I snapped.  
Brody ran a hand through his hair, leaving it even more tousled. 
"Sonia needed a safe place to stay tonight, so she's here at the apartment. Her boyfriend hurt her, and she needs to hide. Our apartment was the only place I could think of where she'd be safe." 
I couldn't believe a word my husband was saying. His excuses only deepened the ache in my chest, and no matter what he said, it couldn't calm the turmoil in my heart. Every sign pointed to their relationship, and he was clearly just trying to cover up the truth. 
"And you think I'll believe that? Brody, I'm done with you! This isn't the first time you've done something with your secretary that I didn't like. I've told you how I feel, but clearly, it didn't sink in. Seriously! How would you feel if you found me alone with another man in our home?" 
He clenched his jaw. "This is different," he insisted. "Nothing happened between us." 
"Nothing yet because I arrived!" I retorted. 
He couldn't believe what he was hearing. "What do you mean by that? Are you accusing me of cheating?" 
"That's right! Given your past relationship with that woman and the stress you are giving me, it is unacceptable! Just leave me alone because right now, what I want is a divorce!" I said, removing his hand from my arm. 
"Jane, please, listen to me-" 
No! I'm done listening! I immediately hailed a taxi and had it take me to the airport. 
As the city lights blurred past the window, I waited for the tears to come. But they didn't. Instead, a cold numbness settled over me, somehow more terrifying than the pain. Just before boarding, my phone buzzed with a final message from Brody: 
***Brody:*** *'Let's talk, Jane!'* 
We'd talk, and then what? End up right back where we started? Why couldn't he just let me go and end this endless headache? 
I turned off my phone because I didn't want him to know where I was going. When I arrived at Highland Hills, I turned my phone back on. I received two messages: 
The first, from our apartment cleaner: 'Ma'am, does Boss Brody have a new woman? I found her here this morning, and the boss asked me to make breakfast for her.' 
I could only shake my head, a wave of nausea washing over me. 
The second, from Sonia herself, made my blood boil: 'Thanks for leaving on your own. I don't like the color of the apartment. Brody likes blue. It's obvious you've stained everything I see here. You wouldn't blame me if I replaced everything here, would you? I won't be at peace, especially once we start living together.' 
The audacity of this woman! I blocked her number instantly! I needed to protect what was left of my sanity. Right now, I no longer care what she wants!  
As I settled into the back of another taxi, I scrolled through old messages between Brody and me. Brody is a natural flirt, reminding me of how easily I'd fallen for him at the start of our relationship. We'd had an agreement, three simple rules: 
**Rule 1:** No children for the next five years.  
It was my decision. I knew my mental state wasn't suitable for motherhood, and I refused to bring a child into this world only to neglect them. We'll revisit this rule once the timeline has passed. 
**Rule 2:** No cheating. Despite this being an arranged marriage between the Martin and Cornell families, we must respect each other as individual partners. 
I think Brody may have forgotten this. 
**Rule 3:** We must be happy and treat each other as friends willing to listen to each other's problems. 
This rule is why I developed such deep feelings for Brody. But now, I realize he might have taken it too literally, seeing me only as a friend and never truly replacing Sonia in his heart. 
Reflecting on the situation, when did I first become suspicious of her?  
Right! It all started three months ago, on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. I was at our kitchen counter, reviewing the monthly bills Joe, Brody's meticulous executive assistant, had sent. 
I've always been meticulous about reviewing card expenses, a habit from my university days in London, to avoid overspending-primarily since Brody was covering the costs. A hacking incident during my second year made me even more cautious. I spent weeks dealing with fraudulent charges and promised myself it would never happen again. 
That's when I spotted an unfamiliar secondary card on Brody's account. The charges were for bags, shoes, and various dining expenses at restaurants and coffee shops. I immediately called Joe to address the issue. 
"Joe, I think there's been a security breach with your boss's card There's an additional card showing purchases I didn't make. I couldn't have, but I was in Paris for that fashion week event when these charges were made in London." 
There was a long pause before Joe responded, his usually confident tone now hesitant. "Ms. Jane, I... well, Boss Brody did authorize that card. He, um, added it to your account to keep it separate from company expenses." 
A cold feeling settled in my stomach. "What do you mean, Joe? These are clearly women's items. Is... is someone else using this card? Is she a woman?" 
"Yes, Ms. Jane. I'm afraid so." 
My mind was spinning. Was Brody supporting another woman? The idea made me feel sick. That evening, I confronted him, my hands trembling as I showed him the statement. 
Brody dismissed my concerns, assuring me he would handle the card payments and insisting there was no romantic involvement with this woman. 
What did he mean, 'nothing romantic'?
###chapter 150: Vows Weren't Enough 
**Jane**  
My heart pounded as the weight of an arm draped across my body.  
"Ahhhh!" I screamed, instinctively recoiling from the unexpected touch. Beside me, Brody jolted upright, eyes wide with alarm.  
"What the hell, Jane?!" he exclaimed, his voice hoarse from sleep. 
A rush of memories from our last encounter flooded my mind. I pointed an accusatory finger at him, confused about why he was there with me.  
"W-what the hell are you doing here?" I stopped short, taking in the unfamiliar room. It was spacious and elegantly furnished, with large windows framing an unknown view.  
"Shit! W-where am I?" A serene landscape greeted me outside the window, with lush green leaves and colorful flowers swaying gently in the breeze. 
"Calm down, alright? You're at my place in Henderson," he said, his tone calm and reassuring. 
"Your place? How?" I could hardly believe it. I'd met Brody in Europe, and we'd been together there for four years. He never mentioned owning a home in Nevada. It wouldn't be surprising if he had properties scattered across America, but the revelation left me feeling blindsided. 
Why didn't I know about this place? 
He looked at me as if I'd suddenly sprouted three heads; his brow furrowed in confusion and growing frustration. 
"Where's my phone? I'm leaving!" I declared, throwing back the covers and scrambling out of the plush bed.  
"Jane, I picked you up from Bronn's place. I'm exhausted, alright? You've worn me out over the past few days. From London to Highland Hills and then here to Nevada. I'm drained and don't want to argue with you right now." 
His words only fueled my anger. My eyes narrowed as I spat back, "You don't need to argue with me because we're done talking!" 
I spotted my phone on the nightstand and snatched it up, striding toward the door. 
"Damn it! What do you want me to do?" Brody's voice rose, unable to contain his frustration any longer. "I already explained it to you. Sonia needed a place to stay, so I let her stay at the apartment." 
I whirled to face him, tears welling up and spilling down my cheeks. "Brody, you're a married man!" 
He stepped toward me, his face etched with a mixture of guilt and defiance. "But we have no relationship!" he insisted. 
"But I need peace of mind, too! This isn't about whether you have a romantic relationship with Sonia or if you're cheating with her or not. This is about me as your fucking wife!" 
Brody swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing visibly. My eyes burned, red-rimmed from anger, frustration, and tears I refused to let fall. How could he not see that he'd done something wrong? 
"No matter what explanation you give, I can't believe it anymore. I gave you three months to sort things out. I tried to forget what kind of relationship you had with Sonia before. I tried to talk to you, but it wasn't enough! I wanted to salvage our marriage or even our friendship, but I've had enough, Brody!" 
I clenched my teeth, struggling to hold back the grief. 
"At first, you supported her financially; then, there were several out-of-town trips with Sonia. And now this last thing-letting her stay in our home" 
I wasn't sure if it was because of their past open relationship or if they were used to having other partners stay over. Just the thought made my stomach churn. 
"Maybe you didn't realize, but my feelings for you are real!" 
For a moment, Brody's face softened. 
"That's how I know you don't love me," I explained, swiping angrily at the tears that had begun to fall despite my best efforts. 
"No, I love you, Jane!" Brody protested, taking a step toward me. 
A bitter laugh escaped my lips. "Don't feed me that bullshit, Brody! My heart has suffered too much, and the layers of lies are only crushing me more!" 
Confusion clouded his expression. "But it's true. I've always treated you well because I love you." 
"No! Lies! If you truly loved me, you'd first consider how I feel. You wouldn't let someone who makes me uncomfortable stay in our home!" 
Brody grabbed his head in frustration. "But Jane, Sonia is the past. She's just a secretary now. I gave her a job because she needed it." 
"Brody, you wouldn't be supporting Sonia's lavish lifestyle if she were just a plain secretary," I spat. "You wouldn't let her stay in our penthouse apartment or borrow my nightgown if that's all she was! What kind of fool do you take me for? Do you honestly think I'm naïve enough to swallow these lies?" 
My husband trembled, clearly unsure of how to fix things. He was still trying to make amends. "Listen, I'll cut all ties with Sonia if that's what you want." 
"But is that truly what you want, Brody? Because if it's not, I can guarantee we'll find ourselves right back here in this same predicament. We'll end up arguing about her again, and you might even throw this back in my face someday." 
His broad shoulders slumped.  
"I've made my decision. What I want is peace of mind, which I now realize you're incapable of giving me, Brody! The way you justify your 'professional relationship' with Sonia leaves me constantly on edge. You keep making excuses and never face the truth!" 
Without sparing him another glance, I turned and walked out of his mansion. 
It wasn't until the crisp morning air hit my skin that I realized the state of my attire: I was clad only in Brody's oversized T-shirt and lace panties. 
I had no choice but to call Sarah. After just two rings, she answered. 
"Where are you, Jane? That imbecile Jakob informed his cousin yesterday that I took you to BM Technologies. When Brody Martin showed up at Emily's, I was trying to keep you from going with your husband, thinking you'd be more composed this morning, but you were so stubborn, clinging to Brody like a lifeline." 
I winced. "Sarah I don't know where I am. I'm just wearing Brody's big old T-shirt. Please tell me you're still in Henderson." 
"Yes, I'm still here, waiting for your call. I told Philip last night I wouldn't leave you stranded." 
Relief swept over me, quickly followed by a rush of emotions that nearly made me lose control. Tears stung my eyes. Damn him! 
The scent of fabric softener and the faint traces of Brody's cologne on the collar made it feel like he was still there with me, haunting me. 
Sarah's sleek black Audi pulled up to the curb after what felt like an eternity but was probably only ten minutes. We didn't speak, but I leaned against her. 
As we drove back to Highland Hills, I couldn't help but question whether I deserved Sarah's forgiveness, especially since I hadn't given my husband a fair chance. 
I missed Sarah-my best friend, my rock-with an intensity that surprised me. 
Simultaneously, my traitorous body yearned for Brody's tender touch, the way he used to cradle me in his strong arms, his lips pressed softly against my forehead. 
Did I go too far with my decision?
###chapter 151: Unshackled 
**Jane**  
For three more days, I focused on work at Luminary Productions in Highland Hills. Despite the familiar surroundings, I found little comfort as I prepared to return to London next week. Brody kept calling me several times, and Sonia also kept sending me messages. 
Sonia's texts grew increasingly venomous: 
Sonia: 'Jane, don't think that Brody loves you. He's struggling to keep his good public image and manage office politics. Your separation would ruin his company. Face it-the only reason he's staying in this sham of a marriage is because of your Cornell surname.' 
Her next message dripped with hostility: 
Sonia: 'Stop being a bitch! You're making things hard for Brody. Because of you, there are problems here at the office.' 
I swiftly reported her number as a scammer and blocked her. 
Why does it seem like I'm the one at fault? Seriously! 
With trembling hands, I fired off a text to Brody: 'Tell your mistress to stop disturbing me, or else she'll face my lawyer!' 
The constant pressure from Brody and Sonia had me on edge, making it hard to sleep and find any peace. Their toxic behavior made it clear that separating from Brody wasn't just an option anymore; it was a necessity. 
My husband and his woman constitute a significant source of irritation for me, which is why I decided to go ahead with my plan to divorce. I don't want to live like this forever with Brody. 
The chairman called me to the office in the afternoon.  
Steeling myself, I entered my father's expansive office, only to stop short at the sight of Brody's familiar silhouette. I rolled my eyes and couldn't help but let out a harsh sigh. As I spun on my heel, ready to flee this ambush, my father's voice cracked like a whip. 
"Don't let that woman go!" he declared. I could feel the sharpness of his gaze on my back. 
Maybe it's because I've been rebellious for several years, or perhaps because my father indulged me so much that it gave me the courage to defy him. 
"I apologize, Ms. Jane, but you can't leave the chairman's office," the assistant said firmly. 
Frustration built up inside me as I gritted my teeth and took the seat across from Brody. I noticed his unshaven chin and messy hair, a clear departure from his usual polished look. 
Looking at me, Dad asked, "When exactly were you planning to inform me about your divorce request?"  
I quickly came up with a plausible excuse. I intended to tell you before leaving, Dad. Work's been all-consuming lately, especially with the projects I'm handling for Philip." 
It wasn't entirely untrue; I've been so occupied at Highland Hills that I haven't considered returning to London. The work Philip gave me keeps me occupied. 
Dad's frown deepened as he shifted his gaze between Brody and me. "What's the real reason behind this?" 
I answered swiftly, hoping to control the narrative. "We've both become engrossed in our careers. We've each built separate lives outside our marriage." 
Brody interjected, "Jane misinterpreted a situation involving my ex at our penthouse. I... I mishandled the situation. I should have approached it differently."  
His admission caught me off guard; it was the first time he'd acknowledged any wrongdoing. 
"I've hurt your daughter's feelings, Chairman Cornell..." Brody lowered his head, hiding whatever emotion he was trying to conceal. 
Dad leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable. "Unfortunately, my agreement with Brody is binding for five years, Jane. You can't file for divorce for another year." 
"What?" I jumped up, feeling a mix of disbelief and anger. Brody stayed silent and wouldn't look at me. 
Does this mean I'll have to endure another year of this? No way! I can stay in Paris for a year to avoid Brody if necessary. 
After talking with my father and Brody, I returned to work and saw a notification from a resort in Mexico. It reminded us about our scheduled couple's attendance for the upcoming weekend. 
A whirlwind of thoughts raced through my mind. First, Brody had never mentioned this to me. Second, Sonia might be the person he was supposed to bring. 
Puzzled by the unexpected message, I dialed Joe Moore, Brody's ever-efficient executive assistant. The phone rang once before he answered. 
"Ms. Jane!" His voice was full of surprise. 
"Hi!" I glanced at my watch and winced, realizing we were in different time zones. "I'm sorry to bother you, Joe. I just wanted to ask about an email I received from a resort in Mexico" 
I trailed off, not wanting to admit my confusion outright. 
"Ah, yes, Ms. Jane. The boss booked that trip. Didn't you get their email last month when he arranged the reservation?" he asked. 
My brow furrowed as I tapped on my laptop keyboard to locate the email Joe mentioned. Sure enough, there was an email I had somehow overlooked or forgotten. 
Joe continued, "To be honest, Ms. Jane, it's been a long time since you and the boss had a proper vacation together. He thought this trip to Mexico would be a nice break for both of you. He had planned to wrap up all pending office matters this week, but..." 
But then Brody followed me to Highland Hills, and I finished silently in my head.  
I said goodbye to Joe and stared at my laptop screen momentarily. 
'No, Jane. You've made your decision!' 
When I left Luminary Productions, Brody's sleek Maybach was waiting outside. The driver looked straight at me, his head bowed. 
"Ms. Jane, the boss wants to speak with you. This will be the last meeting before he returns to London tomorrow morning," said the driver. 
My lips pressed into a thin line as I considered how we needed to talk as a couple. I had questions I needed answers to and things I needed to clarify. 
I got into Brody's car, and we drove in silence. The vehicle glided to a stop in front of an upscale restaurant. Brody had booked the entire place for the two of us, so we were the only customers being served then. 
Brody broke the silence first, his tone more measured than before. "Today is Sonia's last day as my secretary. I've given her a hundred thousand as compensation." 
Sonia's name was the last thing I wanted to hear at that moment. I couldn't understand why Brody had to bring her up. A hundred thousand? I could only shake my head. 
He went on. "I want to apologize for my shortcomings and the stress she caused you. I only recently discovered the extent of her harassment. You won't have to deal with her anymore, so I gave her the money." 
"Brody, it doesn't matter anymore. I've reached a point where I don't want this anymore. I gave you a chance, and you wasted it." 
Brody's jaw tightened. His lips parted several times as if struggling to find the right words. Finally, he simply said, "I'm sorry..." 
He took my hand gently. I didn't pull away. 
"Jane, I have a confession. The first time I saw you was at your school in London. The second time was on the Las Vegas Strip-you were talking with my cousin Bronn. I saw you cry then, and he told me about you. After that, I asked for your hand in marriage..."
###chapter 152: Lost in Translation 
**Jane** 
"Are you saying you intentionally approached me, Brody?" I asked my husband, confusion and hurt mingling in my voice. 
"Yes, Jane. I know about your infatuation with Bronn four years ago. Jakob explained it to me in detail," he admitted. 
"In that case, why did you marry me, Brody?" My mind raced, thinking he had used my admiration for his cousin to his advantage. Perhaps he made a deal with my father to keep me away from Bronn and Emily. 
But Brody's following words caught me completely off guard. "Because I genuinely like you, Jane. I I'm the one who approved your application to the university in London as an exchange student." 
I gasped in shock; the news hit me hard. 
"I admit, I was still in a relationship with Sonia during that time," Brody continued. "She knew about my feelings for you and, believe it or not, encouraged me to pursue a relationship with you." 
My face soured at his words. It made me face the truth about their so-called 'open relationship.' Sonia was his number one, and I couldn't help but think he might have seen me as just a backup. 
Brody noticed my clenched fist on the table and felt compelled to explain. 
"But I didn't approach you then. I didn't even try to talk to you because I knew you weren't that kind of woman," he explained, his words tumbling out faster now.  
"I learned that you had a boyfriend, and I respected that. The next time we met was in Las Vegas... From Bronn and Jakob's parents, I learned that your father was making a deal with them. They thought of me because they didn't want to lose their relationship with the Cornell Family." 
He took a deep breath before continuing, "I must admit that I needed a wife at that time. Many controversies were swirling around my personal and professional life, and I needed a wife from a prestigious family to present to the public. You had a good education, a good job, and came from a good family" 
I wasn't hurt by that because no matter how twisted it sounded, my father was determined to arrange my marriage to someone he deemed worthy. 
"I knew from the beginning that we would have a good relationship as husband and wife. You see, we are now in our fourth year of marriage. It hasn't all been easy, but we've built something real, haven't we?" 
I flinched at his words, yanking my hand from his grasp as if burned. "But you ruined everything, Brody. You've been keeping things from me this whole time!" 
Brody's face tightened, his lips pressing into a thin line. "I kept things from you, but I never cheated on you. I told you about my past with Sonia from the beginning." 
"Brody" I squeezed my eyes shut. The circular nature of our argument was exhausting. Either I was missing something crucial, or he was utterly blind to my perspective. "Okay, is it normal for you to still support Sonia?" 
"No, but I owe her family a great deal. Her father... he saved my life when I was young. I was kidnapped, and he was the officer who rescued me." 
That was news to me. I didn't know that. 
"I must admit, I was easily manipulated because of that." 
A wave of mixed emotions hit me. After years of being manipulated and mentally abused by Madam Cornell, hearing that Brody had gone through something similar with Sonia made me stop and quiet my inner turmoil for a moment. 
"You said you had an open relationship with Sonia," I said, curiosity getting the better of me. "How many other women were there besides her?" 
"None," Brody replied firmly. 
Well, that changed things. It meant that Sonia was the only one who had been involved with others while Brody was with her. 
He continued, "We didn't agree on her last relationship, which led to our breakup. Truthfully, I never liked the open arrangement. I only accepted it because I didn't truly love her in the first place." 
"Then why, Brody?" I wondered aloud. Why was Sonia complicating our marriage if he didn't care for her? 
As if reading my thoughts, he pressed on. "Months ago, she ended her last relationship, needed a job, and tried to rekindle things with me. Of course, I declined! An open relationship is fine if everyone involved is aware of the situation. I only offered financial support because that was all I could manage without compromising our marriage." 
"I didn't want to mix that drama into our relationship. You're the only real person in my world, Jane. You're my refuge from everything, the outlet for my frustrations, the listener to the good things in my life" He bowed his head, and I could feel the raw emotion in his words. 
This was the first time I'd heard Brody express himself so openly, which shook me. 
"But, Brody, how long do you plan to keep Sonia involved in our lives?" 
"I don't plan to keep her in our lives, Jane." 
"That's not how you've made me feel," I retorted, tears spilling down my cheeks. The circular nature of our conversation was tearing me apart. "You hurt my feelings." 
"Please," he begged, his voice cracking. "Don't punish me for this. You won't see Sonia again, I promise. I've already warned her off. Please, Jane..." 
I took a shaky breath. "I'll think about it, Brody." 
He fell silent, the weight of my words hanging between us. 
Part of me had already decided, but Brody's revelations had shifted my perspective. If I were to give him another chance, he'd need to prove he deserved it. My experiences with the Cornell family had hardened me, leaving deep scars. I couldn't-wouldn't-allow myself to be hurt like that again.

**Sarah** 

Standing before the mirror, I carefully fastened my diamond earrings. My eyes drifted to the ornate invitation from my father lying on the dresser, the sight of it still sending a flutter of nervous anticipation through my stomach. 
"Wow, Mommy! You look like a princess!" Rowan's excited voice came from the wardrobe doorway.  
Philip soon peeked in, his broad smile warming my heart. With his gentle hands, he helped me fasten the stubborn clasp of my necklace. All four of us were invited to my father-Mr. Benner's-party at a fancy hotel in Los Angeles. 
I wasn't sure if he genuinely wanted to meet Iris and Rowan, but Amir had assured me this was my father's attempt to mend our fractured relationship.  
After the party, we planned to head straight to Dubai to visit Grandpa Mitchell. 
"Daddy's super handsome too!" Iris chimed in, her eyes twinkling with mischief. 
"Hmph! You're just saying that 'cause you want something from Daddy. I can see right through you!" Rowan teased. The two of them were starting to bicker again. 
I laughed. Philip had a talent for spoiling us all and often made it hard for me to discipline the kids. But when I saw the love in his eyes as he watched them, I couldn't be too upset about it. 
"Rowan, why do you have to be so annoying? It's supposed to be a secret!" Iris huffed, her cheeks flushing pink. 
"Hmm And what does my little princess want to buy?" 
Iris' eyes lit up, momentarily forgetting her irritation with her brother. "I want a unicorn, Daddy! A real one!" 
I burst into laughter at her impossible request. 
With smiles on our faces, we left Serenity Pines Estate and headed straight to the hotel. 
I had no idea that the night would end in such a bloodbath...
###chapter 153: Art of Schmoozing 
**Sarah** 

As we entered the hotel, my family was greeted by the fragrant air freshener smell.  
Rowan and Iris seemed excited to leave Serenity Pines Estate finally. Their outings from the villa had been limited for the past four years, but on the last day I brought the twins to the Luminary Productions' office, we were photographed getting out of the car.  
The uproar was immediate and intense. Social media exploded with speculation, gossip columns spread theories, and even respected news outlets couldn't resist the story. As much as we wanted to keep them anonymous, we knew staying silent would only lead to more speculation. After hours of deliberation and consultations with our PR team, Philip and I decided to address the public. 
Just a week later, we were at my father, Chairman Benner's, high-profile birthday party. It was our first public appearance as a family, and I couldn't help but feel a bit anxious. 
"Miss, your invitation, please?" asked the doorman as we approached the enormous hall. 
I handed over the invitation. He glanced down at my children. Rowan was holding my hand while Iris was with Philip. They were dressed in the formal attire required for the gathering, so I wasn't expecting any issues. 
"The children have their own designated area this evening," he informed us. "Chairman Benner has arranged a special kids' party and entertainment in the Lily Blooms ballroom. It's fully staffed and secure." 
I exchanged a worried glance with Philip, uncertain about leaving our children without either of us watching over them outside the villa. We were accompanied by Trey and three other highly trained bodyguards, but still... 
"I'll stay with the children," Philip offered, his smile warm and comforting. "You should go talk to your dad. I know he's been looking forward to seeing you." 
"Thanks, babe!" I wanted to tease him because I knew Philip didn't like children's parties, but he was determined to fulfill his daddy duties that day. 
Iris tugged at Philip's sleeve, her brow furrowed in confusion. "We're not allowed to go inside with Mommy?" 
"Daddy will stay with you in a special room just for kids," I explained gently, pointing towards an ornate door to our left. "There'll be games and other children to play with." 
Iris looked at Rowan in confusion.  
"It's probably because we're still small! Mommy, I promise I'll join you at every party once I'm big enough!" Rowan said. 
His declaration made me smile, and I noticed Philip trying to suppress a chuckle. 
Philip leaned in, kissing my cheek softly before guiding the two children, followed by Trey and another bodyguard, into the other hall. 
As I entered the grand ballroom, my eyes immediately fell on Margarette and Lila. The two women's gazes narrowed upon seeing me, their animosity barely concealed behind forced smiles.  
Lila had married a man who was utterly dependent on his family, and to this day, she blames me for ruining her reputation. Unfortunately, no respectable bachelor wants to marry her. She even tried to seduce Bronn, but she found her experience with Emily far more satisfying. 
Amir was also there with his pregnant wife, Sienna Blake. The sight of her brought back memories of our chance encounter at the airport years ago, when she had helped me during the shocking discovery of my pregnancy.  
Funny enough, Sienna had moved to Dubai to work for TerraTraxx and became Amir's subordinate. Their relationship took an unexpected turn, and I remember Jessica making things difficult for them before Amir finally decided to marry Sienna. 
"Brother!" I called out, making my way towards Amir. I greeted him and his wife with a kiss on the cheek. 
"Where are the twins and Philip? Why are you alone?" he asked with a frown. 
I explained the situation, "Philip took the twins to the other hall. They've arranged a separate area for the children." 
"Ahh, yeah, I forgot."  
"Please forgive him, Sarah. The baby isn't born yet, so he's not quite tuned into these things," Sienna said with a giggle. 
Before I could respond, a woman approached us. "Ms. Mitchell!" she greeted enthusiastically. "May I introduce you to some friends?" 
Recognizing the networking opportunity, I agreed. As I had anticipated, many business partners were in attendance. 
Amidst these interactions, a man's voice called, "Hello, sister-in-law!" 
He was thin and conventionally handsome, but Philip was far more appealing. 
"I'm sorry... who are you?" I asked, my brows furrowing. As far as I know, my only sister-in-law is Jane. 
"Sister-in-law, ouch! I've heard about you, Ms. Sarah Benner. If I'd known Chairman Benner had a daughter like you, I might have thought twice before marrying Lila." 
Ah, so this was Lila's husband. His identity suddenly made sense! 
"What do you need from me?" I asked directly. 
His smile widened, a predatory glint in his eyes.  
"You're smart. I plan to open a casino business and want strong support. And perhaps, we can do more than just partnership..." he said, his tone suggestive. 
Is he flirting with me? Yuck! I almost felt like throwing up. 
I winced at the man's bold proposal, but years of handling tricky social situations had taught me to keep a calm exterior. Despite my growing irritation, I forced a polite smile. 
"I'm sorry, but my schedule is full, and my funds are tied up with various companies. I'll talk to your wife when I have an opportunity in the future." 
Before he could respond, I swiftly added, "If you'll excuse me, I have an urgent matter to attend to." 
I pulled out my phone from my clutch purse, making it clear that I wasn't interested in continuing the conversation. 
The screen lit up with several messages from Jane. 
***Jane****: 'Love, I've decided to end my relationship with Brody. I'm not sure if I'm doing this right, but I feel he shouldn't have given me problems in the first place if he truly respected me as his wife. I've already given him chances over the past months; I hope this doesn't make me seem heartless.'* 
I wondered if I had done something similar to Jane. No matter what Philip did, I gave him a chance. I didn't want to justify his actions because he hurt me, but I would also suffer if we ended up apart. Philip's love for me and our children had only grown stronger.  
Wasn't that what truly mattered? 
Lost in thought, I hardly felt the ache in my feet as I typed a reply to Jane. Suddenly, a firm grip on my arm pulled me back to reality. I looked up to see Lila, her face twisted with barely hidden anger. 
"What do you think you're doing?" she hissed, "This is your father's party, and here you are, shamelessly using it as an opportunity to seduce anyone you can!" 
I couldn't help but roll my eyes at her accusation. If she was referring to her husband's advances, her anger was severely misplaced. I was tempted to point out that even our bodyguards were more appealing prospects than her philandering spouse. 
Lila poured wine from her glass and then screamed,  
"Ahh! Ms. Benner, I'm not at fault. What happened between us was a long time ago; are you still angry?" She put on a teary act. 
I glanced around; people were staring. Most of the guests were my business partners, and I quickly realized that Lila's outburst was meant to embarrass me in front of everyone. 
As if on cue, her mother was quick to intervene. 
"Sarah, what on earth do you think you're doing?!" Margarette shrieked, her voice carrying across the ballroom. 
"I'm not entirely sure. Your daughter approached me and started making all sorts of accusations," I replied, keeping my tone flat. 
Lila raised her voice even further. "It's true! You're just upset with us because we're the ones Dad truly loves." 
I raised an eyebrow. What I hated most was pointless arguments. Without another word, I turned my back on the mother-daughter duo, determined to extricate myself from their baseless accusations and petty drama. 
But Margarette wasn't finished. To everyone's surprise, she lifted her wine glass and aimed it straight at my back. Everything happened so fast that I barely had time to react. 
No, not me-my dad! The splash of deep red wine that was meant for me instead doused Chairman Benner's impeccably tailored suit. 
"H-honey," she stammered, "It's Sarah's fault! She poured wine on Lila first!" 
Chairman Benner gave her a steely glare, particularly at her wine-soaked dress. "It seems some lessons were missed today I saw exactly what transpired here. Lila, are you absolutely certain about your accusation?" 
Lila's eyes widened, and she looked away. Chairman Benner coughed, and I couldn't help but worry. That's when I noticed Amir had also come over. 
Before anyone else could speak, my father's assistant stepped forward. "Ms. Sarah, Chairman Benner just recovered from the flu. He needs to change immediately."" 
Amir then suggested, "Could you escort him to the suite? I'll handle these two." 
I nodded and led Chairman Benner to the suite. Little did I know that the true test of the night was yet to come.
###chapter 154: Code Red 
**Sarah** 
Two of Chairman Benner's bodyguards-burly men in black suits-followed us closely, their eyes constantly scanning the air. The tension was thick, and the silence between us was oppressive. 
As we approached the Presidential Suite, memories flooded my mind. It had been years since we'd shared any meaningful interaction. The last time we truly spoke, I was pregnant with the twins, and his words had cut deeper than any knife. The pain and rejection still felt fresh, a wound that refused to heal. 
When we entered the suite, a crystal chandelier cast a warm glow over the spacious living area. My father then excused himself.  
"I'll just change my clothes," he said. 
Without waiting for a response, he disappeared into the primary bedroom, leaving me alone in the abundant space. Sitting on the soft couch in the suite's living area, I sent a message to Philip. 
***Me:*** *'Babe, I'm with Chairman Benner in his suite. He intercepted the wine Margarette was about to pour on me. Out of courtesy, I'm here now.'* 
Philip's response came almost instantly: 'What exactly happened? Are you okay?' 
***Me:*** *'Long story I'll tell you later. How are the kids?'* 
***Philip:*** *'Alright! I miss you already! There are at least 15 other children here. Iris befriended a little girl in a princess dress, and Rowan was busy with some building blocks. Oh, and I just bumped into Ethan and Dr. Ruth. Their son is getting so big!'* 
A few minutes passed before my father, Chairman Benner, came out of the bedroom. I stood up as our eyes met. 
"It's been ten years..." he said, his voice heavy with unspoken history. 
I understood what he meant. It had been ten years since he disowned me as a Benner princess. He couldn't accept the results of our DNA test, and neither could I! 
"May I speak with you briefly before we rejoin the party?" he asked me earnestly. 
I nodded before settling back onto the couch. He took a seat in the adjacent armchair. 
"I'm glad you accepted the invitation and brought the kids," my father began, referring to my children. "I have an idea of the path you're on, Sarah I want to apologize for blaming you for my wife's death." 
My jaw clenched. It was laughable that he had the nerve to blame me for something beyond my control. Yet he never considered his infidelity and the pain he caused my mother! 
I remained silent, unwilling to justify or explain myself.  
Chairman Benner's following words made my eyes widen, my heart race, and my mind spin. "Truth is, I saw your mother last month." 
"What?" What did he mean? My thoughts quickly shifted to Auntie Marietta-my mother's twin. 
"Auntie Marietta has deceived you once I didn't think you'd fall for her tricks again" But then I remembered she was in jail after the club incident four years ago. "Wait, is Auntie Marietta out of jail?" 
"No, Sarah. I" Confusion clouded my father's features. My father dryly coughed before continuing. "I... I don't know. You're probably right! She told me she would wait for you in the penthouse suite of this hotel to tell you the truth." 
I wasn't sure if Chairman Benner and Auntie Marietta were playing with me, but my interest was piqued. If the woman was Auntie Marietta, I was more than ready to ensure her return to prison.  
But what if Chairman Benner was telling the truth, and he saw my mother?  
Whatever the result, I felt unsafe, but my curiosity was too strong to ignore. 
"Hang on," I said, rising from the couch. I strode to the floor-to-ceiling windows, and the city sprawled beneath me like a glittering carpet. I dialed Jakob's number. If anyone could get me answers quickly, it was him. 
My friend was currently busy with a project, so I knew he was in the BM Technologies office. 
"Hey, doll!" Jakob's cheerful voice answered after two rings. 
"Jakob, I need you to find out where Auntie Marietta is right now," I said, "It's urgent." 
"Auntie Marietta?" he asked, confusion evident in his tone. 
"Madam Olsen!" I clarified. 
"Oh! Give me a moment. I'll text you as soon as I have something." 
"How long?" I pressed, impatience was evident in my tone. 
"Geez, Sarah! I'll be as quick as I can! I remember your aunt is in jail. This is not an easy task!" 
I agreed. This would require coordination with law enforcement.  
After ending the call with Jakob, someone knocked on the door. One of the bodyguards moved to answer it.  
A woman in her thirties, dressed in a form-fitting charcoal pencil skirt and crisp white blouse, entered. Her strong jawline and cold stare made her look intimidating. 
"Chairman Benner, I'm here to escort Ms. Mitchell to the penthouse," the woman said. 
I didn't recognize her, but her efficiency air suggested she was a sharp assistant. My father's eyes flicked between us. 
"You'll know I'm telling the truth if you follow her," he said.  
My heart raced. This woman might hold the answers, but I was torn between suspicion and caution. After a moment's hesitation, I made my decision. "I'll go, but only if Chairman Benner accompanies me." 
Surprise flickered across my father's face, but he nodded, turning to the woman for confirmation. I could see the same burning need for answers in his eyes. 
The woman's brow furrowed slightly. I pressed on, "I'm not risking my safety. I don't have a guard with me right now, but my father's two bodyguards are impossible to leave behind," I explained. 
"Fine," she conceded, her tone flat and emotionless. 
We left the suite with two bodyguards following us. Chairman Benner walked next to me, clearly tense. The woman led the way. 
As we reached the elevator bank, the hallway plunged into darkness. The sudden absence of light was quickly followed by the muffled pop of gunfire, seemingly emanating from the lower floors of the building. 
My heart pounded, and adrenaline rushed through me. The bodyguards quickly drew their weapons, scanning the darkness for any danger. 
"Wh-what's happening?" I whispered, instinctively grabbing onto my father's arm. 
One of the guards pulled his radio out. 
"10-33, what's the situation?" he barked into his device. 
"Code red, code red!" crackled the response. All units, be advised that we have an active shooter at the party!" punctuated by the sound of distant gunfire. 
Fear took hold as the realization hit me. Tears filled my eyes, and I gasped for breath. Without thinking, I kicked off my stilettos, the expensive shoes clattering to the floor. 
"Protect the Chairman! Get him back to the suite," one guard commanded. "I'll cover Ms. Mitchell!" 
Operating on pure instinct, I sprinted for the emergency stairwell. At the same time, my trembling fingers fumbled with my phone, desperately trying to call Philip. 
This felt like a nightmare I thought I'd escaped, but now the stakes were much higher. My children were down there. 
My kids!
###chapter 155: Shattered Seventeen 
**Sarah**  
Eleven years ago... 
Darkness had settled over the tropical landscape, with the moon barely visible through the thick clouds. Waves crashed fiercely against the shore behind our villa, their rhythmic roar contrasting sharply with the chaos inside. 
Today was meant to be a joyous occasion-my 17th birthday. My family was at the Palm Beach resort to celebrate, but it didn't feel like a celebration. My parents had been in their room for a while. All I knew was that my father had been drinking heavily after receiving some documents from his assistant. 
Their argument echoed through the villa. The walls were thin, offering no soundproofing. 
"Please don't do this, Xavier!" my mother pleaded, her voice filled with despair. 
The sickening sound of shattering glass punctuated her words, followed by heart-wrenching sobs, and it made Amir and me uneasy. 
"Brother, I'm afraid" I whispered to Amir, trembling as he held me. 
He didn't respond. I had forgotten that he had already started to grow distant from me because of Jessica. 
My mother's voice rose again, more apparent this time. "I never blamed you for having another woman! Please, Xavier, don't do this to Sarah!" 
Why is she mentioning my name? I trembled with fear and guilt, unaware of the tears streaming down my cheeks. Was I the reason for their argument? 
Guilt consumed me. Hearing my mother's anguish because of me was unbearable. 
"For seventeen years, you deceived me!" my father roared. "Why didn't I see it? How could I have been so blind?" His rant was interrupted by a painful cry. "Ahh!" 
I flinched when I heard my father's scream, followed by more breaking sounds. His image at that moment was completely different from how I knew him, especially since he always treated me like a princess. 
Without warning, the door to their room burst open violently. My father stood in the doorway, a terrifying sight, his eyes bloodshot and wild.  
He narrowed his eyes at me. The sharp smell of whiskey clung to him, but his steps were steady as he walked into the room. 
"Xavier! Don't!" my mother cried out; her voice hoarse from crying. 
'Mom' 
My father approached me, his fist clenched. He held the document tightly in his other hand, almost crumpling it. Was he planning to hurt me? Should I hide? 
Amir's tall frame blocked my view, shielding me from our father's menacing approach. 
"I'm sure you'll regret this, Dad! You won't hurt Sarah!" Amir declared firmly. 
My eyes widened in shock. Did he plan to hurt me? My father, who had always treated me like a cherished princess, now posed a threat? 
"You are not my daughter!" he spat. With a violent gesture, he flung the crumpled documents to the floor before storming towards the villa's exit. 
I curled, frozen, his declaration echoing in my mind. What could he possibly mean? 
Amir picked up the document, his hands trembling visibly. He glanced at our mother, still weeping in the bedroom doorway, her pristine white outfit now disheveled and tear-stained. My mother's gray eyes were filled with pain. 
"Amir, follow your father!" our mother ordered firmly despite her grief. 
"B-but..." My brother was hesitant and undecided. I knew he didn't want to leave our shattered mother. 
"Your dad's been drinking, Amir! Follow him!" 
"I I need answers!" my brother responded, also in tears. 
"I'll answer all your questions, but follow your dad!" She grabbed Amir by both arms. "I won't let TerraTraxx go to someone else! You'll inherit it, Amir! Follow your dad! Now!" 
As Amir dropped the documents in his haste to obey, I caught a glimpse of their contents. The truth hit me like a tidal wave-I wasn't Xavier Benner's biological child. 
"Sarah..." My mother's voice was soft, full of sorrow. 
I collapsed into her arms, sobs wracking my body. The pain was overwhelming, made worse by the cruel timing. Why today, of all days? 
"What do you want for a gift, dear?" my mother still managed to ask. 
The question seemed absurd at the moment. How could I possibly think about presents? Nothing! I wanted nothing! 
We cried together as she gently guided me to my room.  
"W-who is my real father?" I asked her. 
It took her a long time to answer. Her eyes narrowed as if the name caused her physical pain. "Marcus Blackwood..." 
The moment the name left her lips, the villa was plunged into darkness. Then, like someone who had lost their mind-gunshots echoed. 
"Oh, my God!" My mother's hand flew to her mouth, eyes wide with terror. "He's here!" 
She sprang into action, grabbing her trench coat and draping it over my shoulders. Her movements were frantic, driven by a fear I couldn't fully comprehend. 
"Wh-what is happening, Mom?!" I stammered. The sudden change from a birthday celebration to a nightmare left me stunned. 
"Shhhh!" She pushed aside the pain in her chest and the sobs from earlier. It seemed my mother had transformed at that moment, steeling herself out of necessity. 
She placed a bag in my pocket. "There's money in here, Sarah, and your passport. Whatever happens, promise me you'll just drive. Drive far away, and don't stop!" 
"But Mom, I don't understand-" 
She didn't answer. Instead, she called someone and quietly said, "I agree..." 
Without missing a beat, she dialed 911 without saying a word. Perhaps she believed the sound of the gunshots would tell them everything they needed to know. 
My mind raced, trying to piece together what was happening. Slowly, my mother opened the door to the room, peering cautiously into the darkened hallway.  
We heard a gunshot in the kitchen. We ran in the opposite direction. Silence was crucial: no footsteps, no tears, no sobs, no questions. We squeezed into a cramped space under the stairs, barely daring to breathe. Heavy footsteps echoed through the villa, each thud making my heart race. 
"Daughter..." The way he said the word gave me chills. It sounded almost reverent but had a scary, manic tone. 
I clamped my hand over my mouth to stifle a whimper, my entire body trembling. At that moment, I realized Marcus Blackwood was more than a monster. He chanted my name like a wolf king hunting his prey as if he wanted to kill me.  
As soon as the footsteps retreated upstairs, my mother tugged me towards the garage.  
"This is your dad's fault!" she hissed, but in a lower hush. "Marcus must have found out you're his child because of the DNA test!" 
She shoved me roughly into the driver's seat of her sleek sports car.  
"You must go! Drive, Sarah!" The command brooked no argument. 
Tears streamed down my face as I gripped the steering wheel. "I can't leave you, Mom..."  
The thought of abandoning her was unbearable. 
"He won't kill me! But you, I'm sure he will! Promise me you'll just drive! Don't look back!" she ordered firmly. 
"I-I won't leave you!" 
"What if Amir or your dad comes back? Drive! Don't be stubborn!" Her logic pierced through my panic. 
Tears streamed down my face as I reluctantly nodded. With trembling hands, I turned the key. The sports car's engine roared to life, its sound impossibly loud in the tense silence, revealing our location to Marcus. 
"You'll be safe with Grandpa Mitchell!" My mother's voice was urgent. "Promise me you'll be safe, Sarah!" 
Before I could respond, we heard a man's voice melodizing the words as if we were playing hide and seek. "There you are! I wanted to meet my daughter..." 
My mother blocked the view so I couldn't see him in the rearview mirror. 
"You are not going to kill my Sarah!" she shouted. "Sarah, leave! Now!" 
Following my mother's instruction, instinct took over. I slammed my foot on the accelerator, the tires squealing as I peeled out of the garage. Gunshots chased me, but the car was bulletproof. I didn't know where the car would take me, but I had to be strong. 
As I sped away into the night, my mind was a whirlwind of emotions. Grief, exhaustion, and an overwhelming sense of confusion threatened to overwhelm me. Questions without answers swirled in my head, each more painful than the last 
After two days of driving, I flew to Dubai. My mother had been wrong-Marcus had hurt her. She was killed on my 17th birthday! 
Now, ten years later, he's not going to kill my family! I was careless! I've long feared he'd come after me... 
This time, it's not just my life at stake. Iris and Rowan, my precious children, are in danger too. That monster's blood is running through our veins!
###chapter 156: Uninvited Guest 
**Philip** 
"Daddy, I need to pee," Iris said, her gray eyes wide with urgency as she looked up at me, both hands pressing against her tummy. 
At home, Amanda or Pepper usually handled these situations, sometimes with Sarah's help. I caught sight of my son nearby.  
"Rowan, come! We need to help your sister," I called to him. I had no intention of taking Iris into the men's restroom, nor could I leave her alone in the women's restroom. 
"But I still wanted to play," Rowan protested, glancing at Iris. 
"Please, Brother" Iris pleaded, shifting from foot to foot. Despite his stubbornness, I knew Rowan would relent. 
"Fine! But promise me you'll give me your Monday snack," he bargained. 
"Rowan" I said warningly, not wanting him to take advantage of the situation. 
"I-I'm just kidding!" 
"You are so annoying!" Iris retorted, putting her hands on her hips. I could only shake my head at their usual bickering. 
"No fighting. Come here..." I picked up Iris. Trey followed us, holding Rowan's hand. 
Both of them went into the women's restroom. 
"Okay, you two go in together," I decided, setting Iris down. "Rowan, keep an eye on your sister." 
I watched nervously as they disappeared into the women's restroom, Trey positioning himself near the door. 
After what felt like an eternity, I called out, "Are you done, kids?" 
"Just washing my hands" Iris replied. 
A few moments later, the entire hotel was plunged into darkness, followed by the sound of gunshots. My instincts kicked in immediately. 
"Iris, Rowan!" I shouted, my heart pounding as I rushed into the pitch-black restroom, Trey right behind me. 
"Daddy!" my daughter cried. I felt her tiny body collide with my legs, and I quickly lifted her. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could make out her terrified face. 
More shots rang out, alarmingly close. Iris buried her face in my neck, her whole body shaking. 
"Shit!" The shots were close, and I wasn't sure if we were safe. 
"D-daddy, I'm scared" I could hear the fear in Rowan's voice. He was gripping my pants tightly. 
"Daddy is here, alright? Both of you listen to me. We need to escape!" I looked at my guard. "Trey!" 
Trey was talking with our security team outside the restroom. The door swung open, and two more guards appeared, their faces tense with concern.  
The situation outside was chaotic; some well-known individuals attending Chairman Benner's birthday party were fleeing. 
"Boss, we've dispatched R1 to locate Madam Sarah upstairs," one of them reported. 
"There's a signal jammer in play. We can't reach her, and the elevators are down." 
"Damn it! Sarah!" I felt torn, my heart racing. I didn't know what to prioritize. If I went upstairs to find her, she would surely hate me for leaving our children behind. 
"Boss, we need to move now," Trey insisted. 
He carried Rowan and moved swiftly towards the parking area. I silently thanked our luck for being near an escape route. Things would have been much worse if we had stayed at the party, where the havoc was happening. 
We took large strides as we descended the pathway to the hotel's lower ground. I didn't know where our van was, but I followed the guidance of the three guards. 
"Mommy..." Iris whimpered, her tears soaking through my shirt. 
Suddenly, gunshots rang out from where we had come from, followed by screams. Iris's cries grew louder, and I felt her small body trembling against mine. My own fear rose, but I pushed it down and focused on comforting my daughter. 
Trey yanked me behind a row of parked cars. "Keep low, boss," he hissed. 
"Shh, baby," I whispered to Iris, my lips close to her ear. "Close your eyes, sweetheart. Don't make a sound, okay?" I felt her nod against my shoulder. "You too, Rowan. Eyes closed, buddy." 
We quietly moved through the garage, hiding behind the cars. After what seemed like forever, we got to our van. I quickly put my children inside, securing Iris and Rowan in their seats. 
"Boss, we need to leave now!" Trey urged, his eyes scanning our surroundings. 
'What about Sarah?' 
My mind raced. Sarah was still up there, possibly in danger. But I couldn't risk the children's safety. 
"Call Alex! Take the kids to Alex!" 
Someone trustworthy was needed right now. With Jane in London, leaving my two children with her was impossible. Sending them back to Serenity Pines was not an option, especially since I strongly felt like what was happening now involved Sarah and me! 
I spoke to Rowan, cradling his face in my hands. "Listen carefully, buddy. I need you to be brave and protect your sister. I must stay here to help Mommy, so you must listen to Trey, okay?" 
He nodded, though his eyes were brimming with tears. He took a deep breath and tried to steady himself. 
Iris's sobs filled the van as I closed the door. Trey quickly started the vehicle. Gunfire erupted, bullets slamming into the van's armor. My security guard returned fire at the attacker. My heart eased slightly when the van carrying my children finally pulled away from the building. 
A guard thrust a gun into my hand, my mind already gearing up for the fight ahead. 
We raced back to the main floor. The scene that unfolded was a war zone-injured people scattered, glass shards and debris everywhere. I forced myself to snap into action, shoving aside the shock and horror to stay sharp. 
I had to stay focused. The fire exit was on the other side of the chaos, leading upwards, so my security guard and I ran toward it, remaining vigilant. 
As I reached for the door, it suddenly swung open from the other side. I found myself face-to-face with a hulking figure. Before I could react, a shot rang out. My guard crumpled behind me. 
The barrel of a gun pressed against my forehead, cold and unyielding. 
Damn it! I wanted to curse but knew I had to stay still. Any wrong move and he'd pull the trigger without hesitation. 
"Marcus!" I said through gritted teeth. I'd been trying to uncover this man's identity for years, constantly wary of his presence. Last I knew, he was imprisoned in Alcatraz. So why was he here now? 
A cruel smile played across his features. "Ah, so you know me. I've been waiting for this moment." His eyes narrowed. "Where are my grandchildren? Don't you have any respect for the father of the woman you married?" 
My blood ran cold. This madman would never lay eyes on my children if I had anything to say about it. 
"I've seen them on TV," Marcus continued, his tone disturbingly casual. "Such beautiful children. I want to meet them." Staring into the eyes of a clearly unhinged man, my mind raced to find a way out of this nightmare. 
I watched Sarah slowly descend the stairs, and Marcus must have caught the flicker in my eyes. 
"Dock, Philip!" Sarah shouted.  
But we had underestimated Marcus. His eyes lit up with a disturbing joy at seeing his daughter. In that split second, he threw a knife poised dangerously on Sarah's shoulder! My teeth clenched as I took aim and fired my gun. The bullet struck Marcus in his side, but he didn't even flinch.  
He tried to shoot me in the chest. I dodged, and the bullet hit my shoulder instead. Marcus followed up with a vicious punch that sent me sprawling, his teeth gritted in fury. His strength was such that I was hurled to the floor. Pain shot through me as the bullet wound in my shoulder flared.  
Sarah continued to fire at Marcus through the haze of pain, her hands shaking. 
"Hahaha!" Marcus just laughed, the sound chilling and inhuman. He turned his gun toward my wife. Sarah ducked, but not fast enough. Blood blossomed on her clothes, and my world seemed to stop as she tumbled down the stairs. 
"No!" The cry tore from my throat, raw and agonized. My lips quivered in shock.  
Gunfire erupted from multiple directions, all focused on Marcus.  
"Sarah!" I screamed.  
Through my blurred vision, I saw Josh burst onto the scene, his gun roaring as he unleashed a relentless barrage on Marcus. I forced myself to my feet, grabbing a gun from a nearby guard and joining the fray. My teeth were clenched, and tears streamed down my face as I fired at Marcus with all the fury I could muster. 
The world started to spin, darkness creeping in at the edges of my vision. The last thing I saw was a flood of uniformed officers pouring into the scene.  
As consciousness slipped away, one thought consumed me: 'Sarah.' 
"Sarah..." I whispered before the darkness claimed me ultimately.
###chapter 157: Highway of Despair 
**Sarah**  
As I descended the stairs, the assistant who had come to fetch me from Chairman Benner's suite called out urgently, "Ms. Mitchell, wait!" Her voice conveyed desperation, making me pause despite my haste. 
"What?" I snapped, barely holding my composure. Didn't she see the anxiety on my face and my trembling hands? My heart was racing, and stress and fear were almost too much to handle. My family had abandoned me for years; my life revolved around Philip and the twins. 
"Damn it! Why can't I reach Philip?!" I muttered, already on edge, and her presence was only making me worse. 
Just then, my phone vibrated, the screen illuminating with hope. But it wasn't Philip. A message from Jakob appeared: 
Jakob: 'Doll, according to my investigation, Madam Olsen is still in custody. No changes reported.' 
I was taken aback. So, Chairman Benner had been telling the truth? Did he see my mother? 
"You must end Marcus," the assistant said urgently. 
So, it's true! I can't think of anyone else who would do this but Marcus. He always struck during family events, and his timing was perfectly cruel. It felt like he was determined to ruin any bit of happiness I had. 
My shock deepened as I saw the woman's eyes widen. I drew a concealed weapon and fired at Chairman Benner's guard. The shot echoed loudly in the fire exit. Something clattered to the floor. 
"Stay calm!" she commanded, her voice steady despite the violence. "He was about to stab you. I saw the blade." 
My heart raced as I looked at the fallen guard. A sinister-looking knife lay just out of reach, its blade gleaming dangerously. So, is there a spy among Chairman Benner's guards, too? Without hesitation, I snatched up both the knife and the guard's sleek .45 caliber pistol. 
"Listen! You need to finish off Marcus Blackwood, or it won't end while he's alive!" the woman insisted. 
"I don't need convincing. He murdered my mother in cold blood," I replied, my eyes narrowing. 
"No, you don't understand," she pressed, grabbing my arm. "You need to do this because he's set his sights on your children next." 
"What do you know?" I demanded, trying to make sense of her anger. I had many questions, but I didn't want to give Marcus the satisfaction of knowing how much he mattered to me. 
The woman replied, "You'll find out everything. Marcus has a mental problem. Your mother had to keep him suppressed for years, making sure he stayed in prison" 
Gunfire erupted from the lower part of the building. Damn it! The bursts of shots sent a chill through me-my children! I'd never forgive myself if anything happened to them because of this twisted game. 
"I have to go!" I said. 
My questions were overwhelming, but my urgency to see my children outweighed them. 
When I saw Marcus aiming his gun at Philip's forehead, I summoned every ounce of strength I had to make him vanish. This monster had shattered the Benner family and killed my mother!  
The first bullet tore through my shoulder. Another ripped into my side, and more impacts followed that I couldn't even identify. I lost track of the pain; my body was wracked with suffering. But it didn't matter. All I cared about was making Marcus disappear and ending this nightmare for good. 
Suddenly, I felt weightless, as if lifted off the ground. The world tilted and spun. Through the pain, I saw Marcus Blackwood's face-my mother's abductor, the torturer, the source of all my suffering. 
I refused to give him the satisfaction of seeing fear or recognition. He would not claim even my final moments. 
The rapid gunfire was deafening; the sound seemed to come from everywhere at once. 
"Sarah!" Josh's face appeared before darkness claimed me. 
I don't know how long I was out. It was so dark A persistent beeping filled the room. I could hear the rustling of movement and Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt's emergency tone. 
Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt's voice pierced through the fog, full of urgency: "Her heartbeat is slowing down! This mission is impossible, but we must save Ms. Mitchell!" 
Fragments of memory came back. I saw Philip with blood on his shirt from Marcus's shot. Panic set in. Why was Ethan focusing on me? What about Philip? 
My pleas and questions went unheard as I slipped away again. 
I was transported back to my 17th birthday. My eyes were swollen from crying as I drove through a fast-food drive-thru to appease my hunger. The open road stretched endlessly before me, a ribbon of asphalt promising escape. When drowsiness became too much to fight, I pulled into a parking lot and surrendered to a fitful two-hour sleep before pressing on. 
Drive 
Drive 
Drive... 
Perhaps this was my fate-endlessly driving my mother's cherished sports car, searching for a peace that always eluded me. The road symbolized my life-always moving, never arriving, constantly chasing a horizon that remained just out of reach. 
*** 
**Philip** 

Consciousness returned slowly as if wading through a thick fog. The white ceiling came into focus, along with the steady beeping of medical equipment. I noticed the tubes and wires connected to me, each one linking me to this painful and uncertain world. 
My vision still wavered from dizziness, making it hard to focus. 
My shoulder was numb, but I knew it was nothing compared to what Sarah had been through. The thought of her brought a new wave of pain, and tears started falling. Was she even alive?  
I've faced Death many times, but if Sarah... 
"Boss!" Trey's voice cut through my haze. He approached swiftly, having sensed my distress. A fragmented memory returned to me-handing my children over to him during the chaos. 
"T-the kids?" I could barely speak, my voice a rasp in my parched throat.  
"They're fine," Trey said quickly. "The twins are safe; they're with Boss Alex and his wife," Trey said, though his eyes hinted at something unspoken and tense. 
Summoning what little strength I had, I grasped Trey's collar.  
"Sarah?" I needed to know about my wife. My shoulder, which had been operated on to remove the bullet, throbbed painfully. The gauze on it had soaked through with blood from my restless movements. 
The door opened, and Ethan walked in with a severe expression. I let go of Trey, suddenly gasping for air as a wave of fear hit me. 
"Where is Sarah?" I asked urgently. 
"Philip, I won't sugarcoat this. You'd see through it anyway..." He took a deep breath. 
Damn it! Just tell me what's going on. 
"Sarah's condition isn't good, Philip," he said with a grave expression. "She's flatlined twice during surgery and had cardiac arrests while we were removing the bullets. Several doctors worked on her. She's stable now, but she's in critical condition her heart is extremely weak." 
"I want to see her" I choked back sobs, my vision blurred, fresh tears burning my eyes. Maybe this is my fault 
"Please," I whispered, not caring how broken I sounded. "I need to be with her.
###chapter 158: Soul Torn Asunder 
**Philip** 

I'm deeply grateful that Ethan, Dr. Ruth, and their daughter are safe. They left Chairman Benner's party early because Dr. Ruth was urgently needed at the hospital for a patient in premature labor.  
If my friend and his family had been caught in the accident, Sarah wouldn't have been saved; Ethan wouldn't have been her surgeon. 
Ethan and I have an unspoken understanding; we know the situation without needing words. I'll always be grateful to him for his quick action and unwavering support during this crisis. 
When I was wheeled out of my ward, I saw just how busy the Vanderbilt-owned hospital was for the first time. The corridors buzzed with activity-nurses rushing by with charts, doctors shouting orders into phones, and dazed victims being directed to different departments. 
"Many were injured or killed in the attack. Hotel staff, guests, security personnel... One of your personal bodyguards didn't make it, and another was injured," Ethan informed me as he walked beside my wheelchair. 
I stayed silent, but the pain was evident on my face. I was sure the person with me when we encountered Marcus was the one who died, and R1, who looked for Sarah, was the one injured. 
I turned to Trey. "Please arrange comprehensive compensation for your team." 
"Yes, boss," he replied. "I'll start working on it immediately." 
As we moved through the maze of hospital corridors, I asked, "What happened to Mr. Amir Benner and his wife?" 
Trey's response painted a vivid picture of the chaos. "They were at the scene. Ms. Margarette insisted on staying at the party, drawing attention from the other guests. Mr. Amir Benner had to escort Ms. Margarette and her daughter Lila out when the shooting started. Mr. Benner's wife survived by hiding under a banquet table. Sir Amir's group called the police because he was outside the hotel, outside the jammer's range." 
When we arrived in the ICU hallway, I was surprised to see Josh. The harsh fluorescent lights made deep shadows on his face, highlighting the haunted look in his eyes. His demeanor was dark, not aimed at anyone in particular, but at the cruel twist of fate that had brought us here. 
Seeing us approach, Josh slowly stood up, his movements stiff as if he'd been sitting there for hours. 
"I didn't know your memory had returned," I remarked darkly. The last time we'd met, Josh had seemed like a shell of himself, his mind fractured and unreliable. But now, as I looked into his eyes, I saw glimpses of the old Josh-the one who had been so close to Sarah and the same person who hated me. 
"My memories began to resurface gradually after encountering Sarah. Aside from Mariano stopping me from causing trouble for both of you, I was also concerned about preserving Sarah's public image. She's a mother with a reputation to uphold." 
Josh came close to confirming his connection to Mariano. I recalled a fragment of my conversation with Grandpa Mitchell when I was close to death after the Viper Turf War: 
"But I need to know the truth. Are you Mariano?" 
Grandpa Mitchell had replied, "No, but I know who Mariano is." 
I hadn't thought about Mariano for years, but I'm grateful he had left Sarah and me peacefully. But now, the past was crashing into the present. 
Josh's voice, choked with emotion, jolted me from my thoughts. "I need to know how Sarah is!" 
I looked at Ethan, feeling my throat tighten. I couldn't bring myself to tell Josh or anyone else the harsh truth about Sarah's condition. Ethan saw my hesitation and took over. He calmly shared the grim details I had learned earlier.  
After a moment of stunned silence, Josh left, respecting my role as Sarah's husband. The pain in his eyes was just like mine. 
Ethan guided me into the vast ICU ward. He made me put on a mask and then examined my injury before allowing me to enter Sarah's room. 
"You have a few minutes," he cautioned. "We can't risk stressing Sarah in her condition. And you need to return to your own room soon, Philip." His tone brooked no argument. 
I nodded silently. Ethan and the monitoring nurse stepped back, leaving me alone in the room. The monitor beside the bed beeped steadily in the dim light. Sarah lay in the slightly raised hospital bed, looking pale and fragile. 
Tears cascaded down my face the moment I saw her. I fought desperately to keep my grief in check, but the crushing weight of my sorrow was unbearable. At this moment, I felt the full weight of my past actions and the pain I had caused her. This, I realized, was my punishment-witnessing the person I loved most in the world hovering between life and death. 
When Madam Cornell died, I felt the usual grief of losing a parent. But this... this was different. Sarah's condition felt like a deep wound in my soul as if she had taken part of my life with her. 
"Sarah, please..." My voice cracked, raw with emotion. "I've wronged you terribly, and I know that. I'll spend every waking moment of my life making amends. I'll do anything you ask, anything at all. Call me a brute, a scoundrel, whatever you want. Rage at me if you must, but please... don't leave me like this." 
Tears streamed down my face. My chest felt like it was being crushed in a vice, each ragged breath a stark reminder of the pain I'd caused. The weight of my actions bore down on me, a cruel and fitting punishment for the hurt I'd inflicted upon her. 
I'm in so much pain  
"My love," I whispered, gently holding her hand. "I can still picture the day we met as clearly as if it were yesterday. Your lips were slightly parted when Jane introduced you Your cheeks were flushed, and it was wonderful to imagine kissing them every day" 
"It's been ten years since that moment" I continued, tears streaming down my face. "I have a confession to make; that night at the Cornell mansion, I acted like a lovesick teenager and sneaked into your room. I couldn't help but kiss you while you were asleep. I I had a crush on you but you were only eighteen, a college freshman." 
"You distanced yourself from me when you learned about Megan I was weak back then, trying to find my place in the industry and desperate for support. I didn't choose Megan as my girlfriend out of love. My mother pushed me towards her from the very beginning, and I followed like a leaf carried by the current, too cowardly to resist." 
"On the first day of our marriage, I was secretly overjoyed, yet puzzled. Why would someone as young and full of life as you marry someone like me? 
"I despised you, hated you when you said you only wanted my money! Was that all you saw in me? It hurt deeply. My mother only wanted money from the Cornell family, and telling me you wanted my money was an insult. I'm not trying to justify my behavior, Sarah... I'm asking for forgiveness, even though I don't deserve it." 
I want to stay by Sarah's side, watch over her, and show her how much I've changed. 
"We haven't had the grand wedding you deserve, and our children still need both their parents so I'm begging you, don't punish me like this." 
The agony was too much to bear, and relentless sobs consumed me. 
"I'd give up everything-my life, my future-for yours, Sarah... I love you so much, my love..." 
I kept whispering those words, my heart aching. Why does it hurt so much? 
A nurse came in and told me I had to leave; my visit was over. Trey guided me back to the ward where I would rest.  
As we entered, I noticed three unexpected visitors. 
Trey's alertness heightened when he saw Josh, Mariano's assistant whom I hadn't seen in four years, and the glamorous lady lounging on the couch. 
Her gaze, sharp and calculating, fixed upon me. 
I tried to piece everything together. Even though my thoughts didn't make sense, I still found myself asking the question that popped into my head. 
"Are you Mariano?" I gestured towards the lady.
###chapter 159: Cost of Sacrifice 
**Philip** 
I carefully examined the woman's appearance, noting her powerful and elegant presence, from her perfectly styled silver hair to her tailored charcoal suit. But it was her eyes that truly captivated me. Her eyes were unmistakably Sarah's; no, Sarah must have inherited them from her. 
"Clever boy," the woman remarked, her scarlet lips curled into a small smile. I didn't expect you to make the connection so quickly, linking me to the person who helped you attain your current position." 
The pieces of the puzzle started to fit together in an unexpected way. "Orlie introduced me to Mariano during my first marriage to Sarah," I said slowly, realizing the truth. "It was to keep an eye on me, wasn't it?" 
"You're overthinking it, Cornell," she chided, settling back onto the plush leather sofa.  
Her assistant, seemingly understanding this as a cue, quietly excused herself. "We'll wait outside." 
Without waiting for my reply, she walked directly to the door, followed by Josh in silence. I gestured for Trey to leave me alone with the woman, who I was now sure was Chairman Benner's wife and Sarah's mother. 
Once we were alone, I muttered, more to myself, "I never imagined Mariano was actually a woman. All this time..."  
"But you understood my connection to Sarah?" she asked. 
"Yes, before the Viper Turf War battle," I admitted. "I questioned your decision to let Josh leave my team abruptly. It means you assigned him to my team to keep an eye on Sarah," I paused, frowning. "What I don't understand is how you orchestrated our meeting again so Josh could approach her?" 
She didn't disappoint, her answer swift and decisively: "I sent you the invitation to Henderson for the gala. If you and my daughter hadn't crossed paths there, I would have ensured you attended Amir and Jessica Woods' wedding. One way or another, you two would have crossed paths again." 
"You chose illegal gambling and other shady transactions to stay close to the Benners," I accused. 
The woman sighed heavily. With practiced ease, she retrieved a slim, elegant cigarette case from her jacket pocket, lit it with a silver lighter, and took a puff as if the stress of the conversation had weighed heavily on her-the sweet scent of strawberries wafted from the smoke. 
"I had no choice, Cornell For the past eleven years, I've loathed what I've been doing, but I had to engage in illegal activities because I took on the challenge to save your wife," she said, her voice trembling, taking another drag of her cigarette. 
"It's no secret that I have extensive business connections. I made millions just by watching the stock market. The original Mariano is my childhood friend, but I married Xavier Benner," she paused, her eyes distant as if recalling painful memories. 
"When Marcus kidnapped me, Mariano came to my rescue without Xavier's knowledge. He proposed a deal: He would do everything he could to protect me and Sarah if I agreed to leave the Benners and become his wife." 
"So, it means there is a real Mariano?" I asked. 
The lady nodded. "Eleven years ago, I had no choice but to accept Mariano's offer to be his wife in exchange for Sarah's safety. I staged my death in Palm Beach to ensure Marcus would be imprisoned and to sever my ties with my old life." 
"And Grandpa Mitchell is aware of all this?" I inquired. 
"Yes, and so does Xavier," she confirmed, referring to Sarah's father. "Marcus doesn't know about my father or the mansion in Dubai. Mariano was meticulous in concealing any information that could lead me back to Sarah's grandfather. His organization moved swiftly to cut Sarah's ties to the Benners... It was like she vanished from our family after her 17th birthday." 
I couldn't hide my confusion, my brow furrowing as I tried to process this information. Mariano's manipulative strategy seemed capable of achieving the impossible. 
"So, you made a deal with Mariano, your second husband, to safeguard Sarah from Marcus And Chairman Benner's role was to disown Sarah?" I clarified. 
She took another long drag from her cigarette, the sweet scent of strawberry mingling with the heavy atmosphere. "Precisely!" she confirmed. "Even though we knew it would hurt my daughter." 
"What about my relationship with Sarah? Was that part of the plan, too?" 
Her gaze met mine, unwavering. "Yes. Sarah has harbored feelings for you since she was fifteen." 
I was stunned by her revelation. 
"Mariano meticulously profiled you, Cornell. Let's just say I know my daughter well. I anticipated she would find a way to hide from Marcus by any means. She couldn't be Bronn's wife-Marcus would have easily found her among the Martins. We had to lure Megan out of your life to make it happen." 
My lips parted in shock as the revelations continued to unfold. 
"I'm giving Megan money to keep her with Josh, away from you" Sarah's mother explained. "But the original Mariano, my second husband, passed away. I had no choice but to take on Mariano's identity to continue protecting Sarah." 
She paused, her eyes meeting mine. "I also maintained a connection with you, watching you closely, but you broke my daughter's heart, Cornell! Three years was more than enough. Didn't you notice how your life became increasingly hectic when Sarah returned to Dubai? That was my doing as well." 
My mind spun, trying to make sense of all this new information. The deceit and manipulation were more complex than I ever imagined. 
I struggled to find my voice and retorted, "But in the end, you didn't protect my wife either. Sarah is now in the ICU, fighting for her life!" I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. "Why does Marcus want to kill Sarah so badly?" 
Without a word, she pulled out a photograph from her pouch. It was an old, sepia-toned picture. Sarah's face stared back at me, but it was different-fiercer and devoid of the kindness I knew. She appeared to be from another era entirely, perhaps the 19th or even 18th century. 
"Who... who is this woman?" I asked, certain it couldn't be Sarah despite the uncanny resemblance. 
"Marcus' mother. Like Marcus, she was unwell. She abused him horribly as a child-starving him, beating him, and doing every awful thing you can imagine." Her voice grew heavy.  
"The constant abuse left Marcus with severe mental problems. When he eventually joined the syndicate, his condition only worsened. He killed his mother. I can't even begin to describe the horror of how he did it" 
I swallowed hard.  
"Marcus will never forget the face of his mother, who tormented him since childhood, even during his imprisonment in Alcatraz. Do you know what Marcus called his mother? 'Cunt, witch!'" She spat the words out, disgust evident in her tone. 
"Unfortunately, Sarah has become quite famous over the past four years. I won't stop Sarah from being known or let her live in fear just because Marcus existed. I tried that before, and it didn't end well when your mother hurt my daughter! She suffered greatly because of my decisions!" 
Her eyes reddened, and a hint of tears appeared, but she fought them back. Her face hardened again-a typical Mariano trait. 
Dizziness began to overtake me, and the pain in my shoulder, which I had been ignoring, suddenly flared to life with renewed intensity.  
The woman said her goodbyes, and just moments later, the twins arrived. 
"Daddy" Iris cried, pressing her face into my chest as she shook with sobs. 
"Daddy, why are you in the hospital? Where's Mommy?" Rowan asked. 
The sight of my children, so vulnerable and scared, broke something inside me. I couldn't hold back my own tears as I wrapped my arms around them, their questions piercing my heart.  
Despite the overwhelming pain, I had no choice but to stay strong and keep going because two amazing children were waiting for me-even if it hurt so much
###chapter 160: Unyielding Love 
**Philip** 
A week passed, then two, then three Ethan eventually had to ask me to leave, as some patients needed the hospital's facilities more. 
"I can visit you at Serenity Pines, or even drop by Luminary Productions if you need someone to clean your wounds," Ethan offered. 
I remained silent. I wanted to stay at the hospital because Sarah was here. 
Fear gnawed at my chest, making sleep impossible. I was paralyzed by the terror of receiving the devastating news that my wife had passed away, that her body had finally given out, or any other heart-wrenching update while she was out of my reach. 
As much as I wanted to stay by Sarah's side, I couldn't longer ignore our children's needs. Iris and Rowan needed stability and a bit of normalcy. The hospital, with its sick patients and germs, wasn't a good place for a four-year-old to stay.  
Rowan's small voice interrupted my thoughts while I changed into a clean t-shirt in my ward, trying to gather the energy to face another day. 
"Uncle Ethan," he asked, looking up at my friend imploringly, "are we going home? Do we have to leave Mommy behind?" 
Iris, on the other hand, was struggling to hold back tears. Tears streamed down her chubby cheeks, leaving shiny trails that showed her pain and confusion. 
"Come here" I said, pulling her close. "Don't cry, sweetheart." 
"I miss Mommy" she whispered, barely audible. 
I looked at Ethan over Iris's head, "Is there any way the kids could see Sarah, even for a few minutes? I know the ICU has strict rules, but..." 
The medical team was firm about keeping Sarah away from outside germs because her surgeries were making her prone to infections. But seeing the pain in my children's eyes was too much to bear. 
"I'll make an exception, just this once. They can see Sarah briefly. But we'll need to take precautions," Ethan said. 
We entered Sarah's room together. I tried to muster some bravery as I looked at her, lying still on the hospital bed, her eyes closed, seeming to find peace after her long struggle. 
Iris's quiet sobs filled the room, mixing with the steady beep of the heart monitor. My eyes began to tear up, too. 
"Daddy, Mommy will come home, right?" she asked, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. 
"She'll come back, baby." Sarah needs to wake up. I'm barely keeping it together, and her absence is crushing me more each day. 
Rowan sniffled and said, "Mommy, I promise I'll protect my sister. As you said, I need to be strong, so I'll be strong. I'll share my toys with Iris." He paused, his little hand reaching out to grasp Sarah's unmoving fingers. "And... and I won't complain anymore if she eats my snacks." 
I scooped Rowan into my arms, rubbing his back to comfort him. It pained me deeply, but I knew I had to stay strong for them, no matter how much it hurt. 
"Mommy, I won't bully Brother Rowan anymore..." Iris sobbed, her tiny fists clutching at my pant leg so tightly I could feel her trembling. 
Swallowing the lump in my throat, I knelt, bringing both children close. "Mommy will be back soon to Serenity Pines. She's just going to get better. While she's not there, you need to support each other, okay?"  
Iris and Rowan nodded. 
"Don't worry, kids. Mommy will be back," I said, though I wasn't sure when. I prayed with all my heart that my children wouldn't have to bear this pain. If anyone should be hurting, it should only be me. 
They loved their mother deeply, just as I love Sarah with all my heart.  
I believe she will return  
Throwing myself into work, I tackled the projects I'd neglected for three weeks. Admittedly, I couldn't manage it alone, but thankfully, Emily, Jakob, Bronn, and Amir were there to help. 
A month dragged on, each day feeling like a fight against hopelessness. Sarah was still unconscious, her calm face untouched by the world. I'd spent millions on top-notch medical care and the best staff to watch over her day and night. The cost didn't matter; I'd work forever if it meant giving her a chance. 
While preparing dinner for the twins one evening, I was surprised by a visit from Mariano, I mean Sarah's mother, accompanied by Amir and Josh. 
I greeted them and led Sarah's mother to the study room, leaving my children in the care of Amir and his wife.  
Mariano didn't waste any time with pleasantries; when I closed the study door, she said, "I need a few things from you. First, I want to take Sarah abroad." 
"What? What do you mean?" I demanded, taken aback. 
"Cornell, my Sarah needs a more advanced facility. I've found one in Germany with cutting-edge treatments and world-renowned specialists. I've already consulted with their team about Sarah's case. They believe they can help her recover. I want to take her there." 
The mere thought of Sarah being so far from my family ignited a deep anger in me. I could hardly handle her being nearby; how could I manage if she were in another country?  
"No, Mariano! Ethan Vanderbilt is providing the best possible care!" I respected Mariano as Sarah's mother, but this felt like a personal attack on my efforts to help my wife. 
Mariano's gaze was sharp and accusatory. "You selfish bastard! Do you think you're the only one suffering because of my daughter's condition? If anyone should be hurt, let it be just you!" 
Her words stung, but I forced myself to listen, jaw clenched tightly. 
"When you were in a coma for months after the race, did you ever consider how painful it was for Sarah? She stayed in Dubai even though it pained her not to visit you because she needed to protect your children. Cornell, this facility in Germany could be Sarah's best chance!" 
Call me heartless, but I trust Sarah is in good hands at the Vanderbilt Hospital. She's stable now and could wake up any day now. I needed her here, close to me and our children. 
I don't understand Sarah's mother's insistence, but I declined her offer. 
"Think it over carefully," she urged firmly. Reluctantly, I nodded. 
"There's one more thing," Mariano continued. "I want Josh to return to Serenity Pines to help with the children." 
I frowned deeply at the mention of Josh. 
"The twins are still traumatized by the hotel attack," Sarah's mother explained. "Josh won't just be their round-the-clock bodyguard; he'll provide the emotional support they need right now." 
I hesitated, feeling conflicted. The idea of Josh being so involved with my family again made me uneasy, but I knew she was right. The children's well-being had to come first. Finally, I exhaled heavily and nodded in agreement. 
Mariano continued, "Lastly, I've spoken with my father. We're prepared to take over Sarah's business operations until she recovers and can return to work. We just need your approval to proceed." 
I could no longer manage Sarah's accounts and her growing business. Alex had been helping, even bringing Emily back to Highland Hills to assist. I quickly agreed to the lady's suggestion. 
Of Mariano's three requests, I only refused to move Sarah abroad. I couldn't bear the thought of her being so far away. 
However, fate had other plans. Late at night, my phone rang with Ethan's name on the screen. My stomach dropped; he wouldn't call at this hour unless something were terribly wrong. 
"Philip," Ethan's grave voice chilled my spine. "Sarah flatlined, but"
###chapter 161: Long Road Home 
**Sarah**  
It felt like drifting through an endless dream, each moment stretching into eternity. After my firstborn's death, grief enveloped me like a suffocating shroud. I retreated, closing my heart and mind to the outside world. Joy became a foreign concept, a distant memory I could no longer grasp.  
Nothing could penetrate the fog of my sorrow because deep down, I knew I was fundamentally broken-I was not okay. 
Just like then, my mind feels closed off, wrapped in a thick layer of ice. Driving aimlessly, stopping several times to watch the setting sun. 
I'm heading into darkness, but whenever I hear my children's voices... Philip... these beloved sounds tug at me, urging me to turn back towards the fading light. 
But why did I also hear my mother's voice? 
I resume my journey. The world around me has been leached of color as if a cosmic artist has erased all pigment from the canvas of reality. 
I'm traveling through an endless road surrounded by empty deserts. The monotony should be overwhelming, yet I find a strange peace in this long journey. 
*** 
Consciousness seeped in slowly, like water seeping through sand. I tried to open my eyes, but everything was a hazy blur, with shapes and colors mixing together. A sharp pain started to throb in my head. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping the pain would go away, trying to let myself adjust. 
But my entire body felt numb-my flesh, my veins, even my bones seemed to have lost all sensation. 
A repetitive beep... beep... beep echoed in my ears. As the feeling returned, pain spread through my body-a deep ache in my back, sharp cramps in my legs, and various other discomforts I couldn't quite identify. 
'Is this heaven?' 
A strong smell of medicines and antiseptic filled the air, making me feel nauseous.  
Suddenly, the door swung open harshly, and five individuals walked in, their uniforms identifying them as medical staff. One of them approached me, a man with salt-and-pepper hair.  
"Ms. Benner, please don't be alarmed. I'm Dr. Harper, the head of the medical team overseeing your care. We're going to conduct a brief examination now." 
I tried to respond, but my throat felt lined with sandpaper. No sound came out. I nodded as fragmented memories started to return.  
Philip's face flashed in my mind's eye... Marcus, his gun raised... The deafening crack of a gunshot... My husband's shoulder is blooming red 
Fear gripped me. Is Philip alive? Where are my children?  
The medical team babbled in German, and I couldn't keep up. I heard something about my movement setting off an alert. I glanced around and noticed a camera in the corner with a red light blinking. They checked my vitals, asking questions I could barely focus on. Eventually, with their assistance, I managed to sit up in bed, the movement sending waves of pain through my body. 
"Where am I?" The words came out as a raspy whisper, directing my question to Dr. Harper when he and another doctor were alone with me. 
"You're in a hospital facility here in Berlin," he replied. 
Germany? Of all places, how did I end up here? Did Philip send me away? Who brought me to this foreign land? 
"Where is my family? Why am I here?" I asked, my voice trembling. 
Before Dr. Harper could answer, the door swung open again, and we all turned to look. My lips parted in shock as I saw the familiar round eyes that mirrored mine. There stood my mother, looking older than the last time I saw her. 
Could this truly be heaven? How else could I explain my mother's presence in this strange, unsettling scenario? 
Dr. Harper addressed my mother, saying, "Madam, your daughter is still in shock and may have many questions when she's more alert. As for her health, her vitals are steadily improving. Her blood pressure has stabilized, and her oxygen levels are within normal range. We'll continue monitoring her closely here in the hospital until she's fully recovered, which may take several weeks to a month, depending on her progress." 
My mother nodded in response. 
I managed to ask, "W-why are you here?" 
Her features coming into focus. "I'm Mariano, Sarah..." 
My lips parted in surprise. She then explained everything-how she survived at Palm Beach and why she had disappeared from my life for so long. Despite my physical weakness, my hands clenched the thin hospital blanket covering me. 
"I'm truly sorry. I know it's been a long time since we last saw each other, and I've been hiding for a while. I needed to do that to protect you. Please forgive me, daughter" 
Despite her emotional plea, I wasn't crying. Maybe I had accepted her absence, or perhaps I didn't fully understand, or maybe all the problems, resentments, and pain I'd endured had simply rendered everything insignificant. 
"W-why am I here? Why am I under your care? Where's my husband? Where's my children?" the words tumbled out, and my mind raced with questions. 
"Philip Cornell and your children are at Highland Hills. I asked him to bring you here to Germany because a friend of mine could provide you with advanced medical care. At first, Philip was reluctant and didn't want to move you from Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt's care. But you nearly died the night before I brought you here" 
She hesitated before continuing, "Eight bullets were removed from your body, all inflicted by Marcus. Under normal circumstances, you could have died right there. Josh got you to the hospital just in time, and you underwent emergency surgery. Overall, you came close to dying three times due to complications and blood loss." 
"Shit," I muttered, the gravity of the situation sinking in. "I'm practically a mutant at this point." I couldn't believe the extent of what had happened to me. 
"If there had been a fourth instance," Mother continued solemnly, "you certainly wouldn't have survived. Even Dr. Vanderbilt explained this to Philip, which is ultimately why he agreed to transfer you here." 
"H-how long have I been here?" 
"Eighteen months," my mother replied. My lips parted in shock as the weight of her words sank in. "You've been unconscious for almost two years... Just a moment; I'll call Philip to let him know you're awake." 
"No! P-please, don't!" I protested.  
The thought of Philip and my kids seeing me like this filled me with dread. I could smell the mustiness of unwashed skin and stale hospital air on me. Months without proper care? My hand went to my hair, which felt like brittle straw-tangled and lifeless. 
My skin was nearly as pale as bond paper, and my once-toned arms were now just sticks. This wasn't the body I remembered. This wasn't me. 
I explained to my mother, "Philip has already been through so much. I wouldn't want my children to see me like this... I... I'll do my best to make up for it. Please, don't tell him that I've woken up." 
Over the next month, I stayed in Germany, dedicating myself fully to my recovery. I immersed myself in physical therapy, nutritional support, and countless hours of personal care. This period also allowed me to reconnect with my mother, bridging the gap created by years of separation. I missed my family terribly, but I didn't want to be a burden.  
It turned out that Josh had become the twins' bodyguard, forming a close bond with my children. I can't help but smile at the thought of him.  
Finally, the day came for my return to Highland Hills. It was noon when the plane touched down, and coincidentally, Philip's birthday.  
"Ms. Mitchell," Mariano's assistant said, pulling me from my thoughts, "where would you like to go first? According to Josh, your children are at school and will be leaving kindergarten soon. Mr. Cornell is at Luminary Production's office,"  
"I want to visit"
###chapter 162: Heart Over Vows 
**Sarah**  
When asked about my first destination, I pointed towards the school, my heart racing with anticipation. I love Philip deeply, and today is his birthday, but nothing could surpass the joy of reuniting with my children. 
The school bell rang, and a flood of children poured out of the ornate iron gates.  
The twins emerged from the gate precisely as planned, followed closely by Josh, who ensured their safety. At first, they didn't recognize me. I felt like a stranger in my own skin, having lost nearly fifty pounds since we last met.  
Their confused looks tugged at my heart, but I understood. I always will. 
Iris clutched her beloved rabbit doll, and Rowan had their lunchbox. Tears began to well up in my eyes, but I wiped them away to see the twins more clearly. There was a noticeable difference in how they've changed. They're taller now. Rowan wears glasses, and Iris's skin has lightened.  
My beautiful, growing children... 
"Kids, your mom" I read Josh's lips. His eyes widened as they met mine, possibly alerted by the assistant who was with me. 
Despite the swirling chaos of children and their parents or guardians, my kids spotted me standing by the vehicle with Mariano's assistant. Rowan's lunch box clattered to the ground, forgotten, as they both broke into a run.  
I knelt on the sun-warmed pavement, arms outstretched, waiting for their embrace. Then, small bodies and big emotions collided with me. 
"Mommy" they breathed in unison. I didn't care if we looked messy or disheveled; I hugged them fiercely, peppering their cheeks with kisses.  
'My precious kids.' 
We left the school and headed home. In the backseat, my children nestled against me, one on each side, as if afraid I might disappear if they let go. 
"I've missed you so much, babies. Are you still fighting?" I asked. 
"Sometimes I can't help it! Brother Rowan is still annoying!" Iris said. 
"And Iris is uglier than ever!" Rowan shot back. 
I laughed. 
Iris pouted, her lower lip trembling slightly as she glared at her twin. "That's mean, Rowan!" 
"You're not ugly, baby You look just like mommy did when I was little." 
"See? See? I am Mommy's favorite, after all!" Iris said triumphantly. 
Rowan furrowed his brow. "Mommy, what about me? Am I your favorite, too?" 
"You're both my favorites. You both came from my tummy simultaneously," I explained. 
They both smiled, satisfied. 
According to my mother, Rowan has become more protective of his twin. On the other hand, Iris has become less demanding and more self-sufficient. My husband, Philip, always ensures he comes home for the kids. 
"Mommy, you're not returning to the hospital again, alright?" Iris said with a hint of reproach. Her small, warm hand clutched the fabric of my blouse tightly as if afraid I might disappear. "I miss you so much!" 
"Me too! I miss Mommy, too!" Rowan chimed in. "Mommy, I can speak French now! Daddy taught me every night before bed!" he boasted. 
"Oh yeah? Well, I... I can sing!" Iris countered, her voice rising in pitch. "And I can dance too!" 
"Did your daddy teach you those skills as well?" I couldn't help but laugh. I've never seen Philip dance, but the idea was hilarious. 
Iris giggled. "No! I watched videos on the tablet and practiced every day." 
"I have a dog at Villa Serafina! He's big and fluffy, and his name is Max!" Rowan boasted again. 
Iris, not to be outdone, quickly retorted, "Well, I have a whole garden of plants at Villa Serafina! 
Their friendly sibling rivalry continued as we drove. Ah, I miss my children terribly. If only I could stay by their side the whole day! But I must also reward Philip for being a single parent for almost two years-it was truly commendable. 
"Hang on! What is Villa Serafina?" I asked Mariano's assistant, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. 
"It's your new home, Ms. Mitchell," she replied. 
"What?" My lips parted in surprise. I didn't know we no longer lived in Serenity Pines Estate. 
The assistant quickly added, noticing my shock, "It's in the same upscale neighborhood, so there's no need for concern, Ms. Mitchell. When Mariano took you to Berlin for treatment, Mr. Cornell decided to purchase a new property and relocate the family there." 
I was stunned. The last I knew, Serenity Pines had good security and was safe. 
"Who lives in Serenity Pines Estate now?" I asked. 
"No one Mr. Cornell closed the villa." 
Philip abandoned the home? I didn't know how to react to that. 
When we arrived at Villa Serafina, some guards who recognized me were shocked. "M-Madam Sarah! Y-you're back!" 
"Hello!" I responded with a small smile, immediately reminding them, "I'd appreciate it if you could keep my arrival a secret for now. Please don't let your boss know I'm here, okay?" 
I planned to surprise Philip, to see his genuine reaction when he returned home. 
"Yes, Madam Sarah!" 
I scanned the entire new family home. The lawn was green, and there was a pool, a basketball court, and a place for Rowan's car. This place was meant for Iris and Rowan, which explained why Philip could move the children here. 
However, a pang of nostalgia hit me when I thought of Serenity Pines Estate. It wasn't just a house; it was where my whole relationship with Philip unfolded, filled with many bittersweet memories. 
"Ms. Sarah!" Amanda and Pepper's shocked exclamations broke through my reverie. I embraced them warmly, these two women who had become like family, who had been caring for my twins here at Villa Serafina. I inquired about the twins' new life and was pleased to learn they were in good condition. 
We decided to surprise Philip with a homemade cake. He was still at the Luminary Productions office, unaware of my presence at Villa Serafina. I watched delightfully as Iris and Rowan eagerly adorned the cake with their creative touches. 
When I had the chance, I thanked Josh. Mariano told me about everything you did for me and my children. Thank you, Josh." 
He smiled. "They also went through trauma. They were at the hotel during Marcus's attack. They've recovered and are now busy with various activities. Now that you're back, Sarah, I'll return to my practice. I might even take up teaching at a university. I just... I grew quite fond of your children." 
"Thank you so much," I repeated. 
I wouldn't stop Josh because his life and his calling lay beyond my family. He has many people to help in his profession. I just felt guilty because he often prioritized my well-being. 
I know Josh's feelings for me are deeper than words could express.  
Even though I saw him as a brother and dear friend, I hoped he would find a woman who could truly reciprocate his devotion. 
At seven in the evening, I inquired about Philip's whereabouts.  
"Madam, he visited Serenity Pines Estate..." one of the staff informed me.  
'Didn't they say Philip closed the villa?' 
I didn't know what was happening. Another hour passed with no sign of Philip. Feeling increasingly uneasy, I decided to leave Villa Serafina and head to Serenity Pines Estate, unable to ignore the urgent feeling inside me. 
When I arrived at our former home, my heart ached deeply at what I witnessed.
###chapter 163: Heavenly Illusions 
**Philip** 
I'm here at Serenity Pines Estate, seeking a bit of solitude before midnight passes. Despite weeks of working nonstop, Sarah's presence lingered everywhere. Her hold on my heart hasn't faded with time or distance. 
As soon as I stepped through the door, it felt like I could see a younger Sarah sitting on the couch, waiting for me. In my mind's eye, she stood, a warm smile gracing her lips. "Have you eaten?"  
Reality hit hard as my fist clenched. These were just memories, as delicate as spun glass. I walked to the kitchen, where the marble countertops glowed in the moonlight. My hands shook as I reached for the crystal decanter, pouring a generous amount of aged scotch. The amber liquid shimmered, offering a brief escape from my thoughts. 
I bought Serenity Pines on the second night Sarah and I were married, ensuring it had top-notch security. Sarah might not have noticed, but every part of this home was a tribute to her-from the soft cream bedroom walls to the handcrafted bookshelves filled with her favorite books, according to Jane. 
The scotch burned a path down my throat as I lost myself in memories. One glass became two, and it became half the bottle.  
I've lost track of time. In the back of my mind, I knew Iris and Rowan were waiting in Villa Serafina, probably wondering why Daddy was late again.  
My feet shuffled across the soft carpet as I headed to our bedroom. My chest tightens at the thought of how much of a dishonorable husband I've been. But this room also used to be filled with Sarah's scent, her laughter, her smiles 
It felt like Sarah was sitting at the edge of the bed. Kneeling there, I clutched the cover, and tears streamed down my face. How long has it been since I last felt her hand in mine? How long have I been hurting like this? 
The pain, which I had kept hidden during the day, came out in heavy sobs. 
"Please come back, my love" I plead into the darkness. This morning's breakfast flashed through my mind-Rowan's innocent gray eyes looking up at me over a bowl of cereal, asking when we would visit Mommy. The question had lodged in my heart like a splinter. 
Maybe it's the alcohol deepening my emotions, but I can't stop the tears as I crouch on the bed.  
"Philip?" The voice makes me freeze. I look toward the door, where the sound of my name came from. Our room is dark, but I see my wife's figure in a white dress. 
Sarah never wore white. In the four years she spent as Iris and Rowan's mother, she recovered from mourning our first child, but she only wore blue, gray, and black-nothing colorful, nothing bright, no white 
"Are you an angel?" I murmured. 
"I miss you, Philip" she said. 
Her gray, round eyes offered me a sense of calm. 
"You're not going to leave me again, are you?" I asked, my voice tinged with hurt and desperation. I must have been intoxicated. 
*** 
**Sarah** 

My car's wheels crunched on the gravel as I drove up to the gate of Serenity Pines. The estate stood dark and imposing, its windows like empty eyes in the night. I parked behind Philip's black sedan, my heart racing with anticipation and a bit of nervousness. 
Trey, Philip's bodyguard and driver, was leaning against his car. As recognition dawned in his eyes, he inhaled sharply. I pressed a finger to my lips, signaling him to keep quiet.  
"M-Madam Sarah!" he exclaimed in a low tone as if he had seen a ghost. He approached me, eyes wide. "It's true! It's really you!" 
"Where's Philip?" I asked. "Why are you still here? I've been at Villa Serafina with the children for some time now." 
"You've been here for a while?" His lips parted further. "No one reported to us." 
"I wanted to surprise Philip," I explained. "I'll go inside." I didn't wait for his response and entered through the slightly open gate. The lights throughout the villa were dim as if they had been intentionally kept dark. 
The front door opened quietly at my touch. The living room was empty, showing signs of loneliness. In the kitchen, a half-empty bottle of scotch and a used glass hinted at lonely night and unspoken sorrows. 
My feet carried me up the stairs, and I found him in our bedroom, hunched over by the edge of the bed, his body wracked with sobs.  
The sight pierced my heart like a dagger. I used to think there was no hope that Philip would love me, but here was the evidence... 
He chose to keep our children away from Serenity Pines so they wouldn't see him at his lowest. He didn't want them to witness his sorrow. 
"Philip..." I called softly. 
I never thought Philip could surpass the love I had for him. He loved me more deeply than I ever felt capable of loving him. Love is not a competition, but my feelings for him felt inadequate. 
My heart constricted when he asked if I wouldn't leave him.  
"Yes..." I replied, approaching him and offering my hand to help him stand. He took it but placed his weight on the bed to help himself up. 
"Are you an angel?" Philip asked, his rough hands gently holding my cheeks. The pungent smell of whiskey on his breath made me wonder if he was sober. 
I fought back a chuckle. "No, Philip... just me." 
He ran his fingers through my hair, his gaze moving from my cheek down to my lips. 
"Happy birthday, Philip!" I said, forcing a bright smile despite my jetlag. 
He pulled me into a hug. "Thank you, my love" After a moment, he seemed to realize. "I need to sober up. I can't go home like this. Iris would give me that disapproving look, and Rowan... would figure out I've been drinking." 
"You've done well, Philip. Our kids are amazing!" I felt tears prickling at the corners of my eyes, overwhelmed by the moment. 
His thumb gently brushed away a stray tear. "Don't cry... Will you stay with me for a while? Just until I'm more... presentable?" 
"Of course!" Didn't he know I had just arrived from another country? Thankfully, I'd slept through the entire flight. 
Serenity Pines will always be our sanctuary of love. 
The scent of pine and lavender filled the air as we settled into the soft bed with Philip's arms around me. 
I silently prayed for smoother sailing ahead-no more earth-shattering revelations or family crises. We could navigate this new ###chapter together.  
We'll dedicate our love to our children I'm home 
Time seemed to slip away as I fell asleep, but when I opened my eyes, I was met with Philip's orbs. 
"Hi..." I mumbled, still groggy, but smiled at him. 
"Y-you're real!" 
"Uh, yeah" I shrugged. It was already bright outside Serenity Pines, which meant Philip and I had stayed up until morning. It was only then that I remembered my kids were waiting for us. 
I bolted upright. "Oh god, Philip! Why did we stay here all night? I was supposed to meet you at our new place! Iris and Rowan... they might think yesterday was just a dream! I'm such an idiot!" I rambled, frustrated and disoriented. 
"This is all your fault, Philip!" I complained nonstop. Philip stared blankly for a moment before pulling me into a crushing embrace. 
"Fuck, fuck, fuck! You're back! I thought I'd dreamed of an angel last night. I was so afraid to wake up..." he said, voice muffled against my hair.  
"An angel?" I scoffed, pushing back slightly. "You thought some random woman came in and snuggled with you while you were drunk? And that would be okay? Are you that vulnerable?" 
He silenced me by pressing his lips to mine. 
"Ugh!" I grimaced, pulling away. "Your breath stinks, Philip! It smells like stale booze!"  
Without warning, he scooped me up, strong arms cradling me as he carried me towards the en-suite bathroom. "Let me see your body" 
I crossed my arms over my chest, feeling violated. I just got here, and he's already being a perv?
###chapter 164: Anchored by Bonds 
**Sarah**  
Philip gently removed my simple white dress, his eyes filled with a mixture of love and concern as he took in my changed appearance.  
"W-why are you doing this? Philip, I just came out of a coma. I'm not ready for anything... physical." I said honestly. After nearly two years of medical interventions, my body was still fragile, and I had only been recovering for a month.  
His gaze softened immediately. "Oh, Sarah, no. That's not why I'm not trying to take advantage of you. It's just that" He examined my skin and my arm, which had thinned considerably. I felt a bit uncomfortable with what he was doing. "You've lost so much weight."  
A flicker of insecurity flashed through me. I pouted and squinted at him.  
"What do you mean by that? Do you find me unattractive?"  
"No, no. No, babe!" he vehemently denied. "That's not what I meant. It's just"  
It took a while before Philip continued. "I vividly remember the day Marcus shot you. Your last appearance is etched in my mind. It's been months since we last saw each other, and I just wanted to note for myself what I need to do to make you healthy and vibrant again."  
The depth of his concern was evident in every line of his face as his gaze roamed over me, assessing me. "I want to take care of you, my love. You've done so much for me, sacrificed so much."  
After that, we lowered ourselves into the bathtub, the rose-scented water enveloping us in warmth. Philip's touch was gentle as he washed my skin, gliding over my healing scars. Each caress showed how much he loved and missed me.  
"I've missed you terribly," Philip murmured, his lips brushing against my neck in a feather-light kiss. His fingertips trailed along my arm, leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake.  
"Sarah," he breathed, "your heart belongs to me" I could feel the restraint in his touch, the careful way he held himself back out of respect for my condition.  
I reminded him so we wouldn't do anything foolish, "We should finish up soon, babe. Rowan and Iris are waiting for us."  
Philip nodded. He lifted me onto his body first before kissing me with longing and desire.  
Ah, I miss kissing Philip. This man gave me pleasure, love, my dreams  
As we approached Villa Serafina, our twins, Iris and Rowan, stood at the entrance with mock outrage and barely contained excitement.  
"Daddy, you are bad! Why did you take Mommy all to yourself?" Her cheeks puffed out in an adorable pout.  
Rowan, not to be outdone, chimed in, "That's right! We missed Mommy too!"  
"President Cornell," Iris declared, wagging her finger in an uncanny imitation of Alex, "back to your office this instant!"  
I laughed. "Sorry, babies. I was exhausted last night. Can you find it in your hearts to forgive me? And forgive Daddy, too-it is his birthday."  
Iris's pout wavered, but she maintained her stance.  
"How about this - to make it up to you both, we'll go on a family vacation. How does that sound?" Philip suggested.  
"Oh? And where might we be going?" I asked him.  
"It's a surprise!" Philip's lips curved into a mysterious smile.  
At that, the kids' eyes widened in amazement.  
"Yay!" they cheered, jumping up and down. "Can I bring Max too?" Rowan asked, referring to his fluffy dog.  
"Of course you can, champ!" Philip replied, ruffling Rowan's hair affectionately.  
I suggested, "Kids, why don't you show Daddy the special cake we made?"  
We went straight to the kitchen and sang "Happy Birthday" to Philip. He smiled and held my hands tightly.  
"I love you, Daddy!" the kids exclaimed one after the other.  
"Daddy, you must make a wish before you blow the candle," Iris said.  
Philip kissed Iris on the cheek, then Rowan, and finally me.  
"To be completely honest, I have no more wishes. Everything I could ever want is right here in this room," Philip began. "But I'm grateful that not only my twins are here, but Sarah is here too." His gaze locked with mine, conveying a world of unspoken love. "I hope I've managed to give Sarah everything she's ever wished for."  
I looked at him and then at my twins. My mind flashed back to a time when all I'd wanted was a second chance at love, a chance to heal from past wounds.  
Who could have predicted I would find it in the same man, but a better husband, the father of my kids...  
Philip Cornell, the son of the person I hated the most  
The man who loves me deeply  
The father of my children  
"I love you, Philip," I whispered. "Happy birthday, my love."  
He squeezed my hand again, leaning in for a tender kiss filled with promise.  
***  
That evening, I invited my friend Jane to discover what was happening with her. She was alone in their mansion, and I wanted to thank her because she often visited my children. I asked Philip about it, and he agreed to invite Jane.  
Jane has always been more than just a friend-she's like a sister, my best friend  
She may have done foolish, but I found it easy to forgive her like a sibling, especially considering how she had supported my children while I was away.  
As Jane's sleek car pulled to the villa, she quickly exited and hurried inside.  
"Where is Sarah?" she asked with urgency as she called out.  
She found me in the kitchen, preparing dinner for the family. We postponed it for my husband's birthday last night, hence my invitation to Jane. Philip had stepped out momentarily for an important meeting, leaving me to manage the cooking and our excited children.  
"Oh my God, Sarah!" Jane exclaimed, enveloping me in a warm hug before stepping back to examine me closely. Her eyes widened with concern. "You've lost so much weight!"  
I smiled weakly, knowing there wasn't much I could do about it. My diet was still restricted as part of my recovery.  
"Auntie Jane, my Mommy is still pretty!" Rowan chimed in, placing freshly washed vegetables on the table.  
"Yeah, Auntie Jane is pretty, too!" added Iris.  
"Aww!" Jane smiled. Noticing my busy state in the kitchen, she immediately offered to help. As we worked side by side, chopping vegetables and stirring sauces, we fell into an easy conversation about her current position at the Luminary Productions.  
Eventually, I broached the subject I'd been curious about. "How's Brody Martin doing?"  
Jane's knife paused mid-slice. "We're... friends," she said carefully.  
"He's still in Europe. Whenever I'm in London, we happen to meet up. My relationship with him is good. I think he's moved on already.." Jane continued slicing the zucchini, her head slightly bowed as if to hide her emotions.  
"How about you? Have you accepted that you two are no longer together?" I asked gently.  
Jane fell silent for a moment. "I don't know, Sarah. Part of me feels like I should find someone new. I've tried dating, but..." She trailed off, then continued, "Whenever Brody and I meet for dinner or just to catch up, it's like my heart only beats for him."  
I understood her feelings all too well. That's how I had felt about Philip-that internal struggle when your mind tells you one thing, but your heart fights for another.  
"Give yourself time, Jane. There's no rush. You're doing well, focusing on your career and yourself. The rest will fall into place when it's meant to," I reassured her.  
Jane shared more stories with me, her eyes lighting up as she recounted amusing tales about Iris and Rowan. Her laughter filled the kitchen, a welcome sound that reminded me of simpler times.  
A moment later, Philip came in from outside. Rowan and Iris greeted him, and I couldn't help but notice how clingy they still were with him.  
It had barely been five minutes since Philip returned from the office when, to my surprise, a parade of familiar faces began to arrive at Villa Serafina.  
First came Jakob and Lexi, the couple who had chosen a child-free life. Bronn and Emily, followed them and their daughter Willow was in tow. Amir arrived with his wife, and to my shock, my mother was with them.  
I was astonished by the line of cars stopping outside our house. While I appreciated their thoughtfulness, a part of me longed for a quiet evening with just Philip and our children.  
Philip's voice, tinged with irritation, cut through my thoughts. "Why are you all here?"  
I glanced at my mother. As far as I knew, she was the only one who knew I had returned to Highland Hills.  
"I told Amir! And then he invited me to come along," Mom explained.  
I turned to Amir.  
"Uhm, I I only told Jakob, and I might have mentioned that Mom and I were visiting tonight," Amir admitted.  
Jakob jumped in, "I thought you were inviting Lexi and me! I told Emily, and she might have told Bronn?"  
"You're not sure?" Jane snapped. "Idiot! Of course, they're married!"  
Feeling overwhelmed, I took Philip's hand. "I'm sorry..." I whispered.  
He sighed. "Is there anything I can do about it? Honestly, I can see that you miss your friends too!"  
I winced, realizing I'd been so transparent.  
To comfort myself, I thought about Philip's surprise vacation. That would be our chance to have a peaceful family time.  
As the evening progressed, I learned more about what I'd missed. Madam Olsen was still in jail, my investments were thriving, my LoveLogic app had become the top dating app, and Amir had been promoted to CEO of TerraTraxx.  
I couldn't ask for more.  
The next day, I met one more person-my father, Mr. Benner.
###chapter 165: Second Marriage Chance  
**Sarah**  
My father, Mr. Benner, contacted me again. After years of estrangement, I decided it was time to meet him and finally confront our tumultuous past. 
Accompanied by Trey, I arrived at the hotel suite where he was staying. His assistant, a woman in her thirties, greeted us at the door with a smile.  
"Good afternoon, Ms. Mitchell!" she said warmly. 
"Hello," I managed. 
"Please, come in," she said, stepping aside to let me enter. 
I walked across the plush carpet until I saw Mr. Benner. My father, once a towering figure of authority, now sat in a wheelchair. His once jet-black hair had faded to steel gray, and deep lines etched his face.  
It had been a long time since he had disowned me. 
"I'm so happy to see you, Sarah," he said, his voice filled with emotion. "You've lost so much weight, my dear" 
'My dear' 
I approached him, extending a carefully wrapped package. "I brought you something," I said, "Three first editions by Haruki Murakami. Your favorite." 
He smiled appreciatively. "Thank you! Uh, would you like something to eat?" He didn't wait for my reply. "Carla, please order something for Sarah!" 
"Yes, boss!" the assistant replied. 
I sank into the supple leather of an oversized sofa. Once we were alone, I steeled myself to ask the question that had been weighing on me. 
"Dad," I began, the word feeling foreign on my tongue, "did you know that Mom is Mariano?" 
He took a deep breath and nodded. "Yes." 
"Then why were you so hesitant the last time we spoke? When we spoke during the hotel attack, why didn't you tell me outright that Mom was there?" 
"I was terrified," he admitted, his voice trembling. "I don't know how to explain. I disowned you for years and saw that you were stronger than I expected It's my fault he found you," he confessed. 
A heavy silence fell between us before he continued.  
"I met Marcus before our vacation. I didn't know who he was at the time. He approached me at the hotel and saw your picture on my phone screen while I was talking to a business partner. Marcus was the one who made me doubt and subtly suggested I should take a paternity test. I had no idea he had abducted your mom in the past" 
My lips pressed into a thin line as I processed the weight of his words. Dad's voice trembled as he continued, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. 
"I had no idea that Marcus's obsession with you stemmed from your resemblance to his mother, Sarah. I was completely blinded by my anger when I received the DNA results from the assistant. I felt so betrayed and deceived"  
Dad recalled our time at Palm Beach. "When I returned to our rented villa, chaos greeted me. Everything was in shambles, broken and scattered. I was terrified I couldn't find you or your mother. Then the original Mariano told me your mom would never return I didn't imagine how far-reaching the consequences of my actions would be"  
"They explained that you needed to stay in Dubai and that I had to cut off all connections with you. Marcus... he had already eliminated Margarette's first daughter, believing it was you."  
I gasped at the revelation.  
"To make amends with Margarette, I married her. Your mother's death was staged, and only the three of us knew the truth-your mom, me, and Grandpa Mitchell. We endured, we sacrificed, all to keep you safe. This continued until Marcus was finally apprehended and imprisoned in Alcatraz." 
Tears streamed down my face, mirroring the ones now falling freely from Dad's eyes. 
"It's all my fault, Sarah At Amir's wedding, I was terrified. Your grandfather urged me to end the madness, but I knew it wasn't over-Marcus was still alive then. Months turned into years, and you built your own family, Sarah. But I will forever regret what I put you through." 
I moved closer and hugged him.  
"You did well, Sarah. You did great, and I'm proud of you!" Dad murmured, his hand gently stroking my hair. That's what I needed to hear from him.  
I hadn't realized how deeply my life was tangled in this web of deceit and danger. 
"I wanted to thank your grandfather for accepting you with open arms when I couldn't. Unfortunately, he passed away after his illness. He was deeply hurt when you were in a coma," Dad added quietly.  
My tears flowed more freely. My mother had already told me about that while I was still recovering in Berlin.  
I remembered my conversation with Grandpa Mitchell when he learned I was pregnant with Philip. He had said he just wanted me to be happy, no matter my decision. 
*** 
Our family traveled to beautiful Maui, Hawaii, where my husband Philip had planned a surprise. The excitement of what was coming made our tropical vacation even more special. 
As the gentle Hawaiian breeze flowed through our rental, my twins came to me with excited eyes, holding a box with great anticipation. Inside was a white, flowy summer dress they had chosen for me. 
"Mommy, please wear this Please?" Iris begged. 
"Mommy, that's a gift from Iris and me. We picked this day to give you the dress!" Rowan added excitedly. 
I was puzzled. "Does this mean you knew we were going to the beach?" 
They exchanged glances. "No," they answered in unison, a little too quickly to be convincing. 
"I-it just so happened" Iris mumbled, unable to meet my gaze. 
"You're not very good at lying, Iris!" Rowan said, betraying his sister. 
Annoyed at being blamed, Iris retorted with a huff, "It's your fault! You let me say that Daddy told us in advance!" 
I couldn't help but laugh at their adorable squabble. "It's not your fault, baby. If anyone's to blame, it's your crafty Daddy!" 
As I watched them bicker, I saw so much of Philip and me in our children, even in the most minor things. They tease each other endlessly, but they always have each other's backs. 
On my second day at Villa Serafina, the teacher called me because Rowan had punched a bully, bothering Iris. 
Pushing these thoughts aside, I slipped into the beautiful dress my children had thoughtfully chosen. I realized Philip must have missed seeing me in such a feminine, romantic outfit. 
With the dress on, the kids led me to a pavillion surrounded by a myriad of flowers. At the front, a thick white curtain was set up for some presentation.  
"Are we lost, kids?" I asked 
They didn't answer. I was curious to know how far Philip had gone with the arrangements. Given how beautifully it was decorated, I initially thought someone else had rented the pavilion.  
But then, a presentation started playing at the entrance. 
Philip's face appeared on the screen. "I have a story to tell" 
To my surprise, an old photo of me from college appeared on the screen, showing a candid moment with Jane, his sister. I felt a mix of nostalgia and confusion-I had no idea Philip had been taking pictures of me back then.  
He confessed he had a crush on me from the start. 
"And yeah, I stole kisses from her while she was sleeping," he continued. My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. I never thought Philip would do something like that, even though I'm older now. 
The following images are from when Philip and I married, with his voice playing in the background. 
"Sarah has a heart overflowing with warmth and kindness for everyone around her. Her intelligence shines as brightly as her smile, but her boundless love as a mother and wife takes my breath away. Honestly, I feel unworthy to call myself her husband" 
My eyes welled with tears of joy as he continued,  
"Two years ago, I made a vow to myself that I would propose to the mother of my children in the way she deserved-a proper proposal. It was Sarah who took the initiative, proposing to me not just once but twice in the past." 
I laughed through my tears at his words, unable to respond because of their truth. 
'That's why' those words marked the end of the video. 
As I turned around, my breath caught in my throat. There stood Philip, devastatingly handsome in a crisp white button-up shirt and shorts, the golden Hawaiian sun casting a halo around him. His eyes, filled with love and promise, met mine. 
"My love, my heart, my everything-would you do me the honor of marrying me once again?" he asked. 
"Of course!" 
Our children, Rowan and Iris, erupted into joyous cheers and applause, their happiness mirroring our own. 
Philip gently took my hand, pressing a tender kiss to my knuckles before drawing me close and capturing my lips in a kiss. 
In this third wedding, I will be the bride-radiant, cherished, and entirely in love. I'm thrilled to marry Philip for the third time, surrounded by our precious children, my parents, Amir, and my friends as witnesses. 
At that moment, I felt a deep happiness radiating from every part of me. I was content, deeply loved, and immensely grateful. 
It's not just I who's been given a second chance at love-it's Philip and me, together with all the blessings bestowed upon us. 
Though I was once devastated and heartbroken after losing a baby in our first marriage, now I have Iris and Rowan; two beautiful children. 
I have Philip 
I have a stronger, more resilient version of myself 
As we stood there, wrapped in each other's arms with the paradise of Hawaii surrounding us, I knew this was more than just a proposal. It was a celebration of our journey, a testament to the power of enduring love, and a promise of the beautiful future we would continue to build together.
SPECIAL ###chapter 1 
**Jane**  
Tears welled up in my eyes as I watched Philip and Sarah's fairy-tale wedding. We were in Dubai, at Grandpa Mitchell's mansion, surrounded by a small circle of close friends and family, all gathered to witness the couple's intimate vows. 
Yet, as they exchanged their promises of love, a deep sense of incompleteness washed over me. Perhaps there's truth in the saying that when life becomes a cycle of repetition-office, work, the Cornell mansion, and back again-you start to feel like something important is missing. 
After the ceremony, I embraced Sarah tightly, tears threatening to spill. "Congratulations, love!" 
The celebration continued, but my thoughts were elsewhere. I knew I needed to return to London to calm my churning emotions. 
"Auntie Jane, are you alright?" Iris asked, her voice full of concern as she sat beside me at the round table with Rowan by her side. 
I plastered on a smile, hoping it looked genuine. "Yes, sweetheart. Why do you ask?" 
"You look sad." 
I managed a small lie, surprised by the perceptiveness of such a young girl. "I'm not sad, Auntie Jane just has a headache. And I'll miss you because I'll return to work soon." 
"Aww..." Ronan pouted, making me feel guilty about leaving. 
As the evening progressed, I made my way through the crowd to find Sarah. She was radiant, champagne flute in hand, laughing at something Philip had said. I hated to dampen her joy, but I needed to tell her. 
"I have to go to London; I need to take care of something. My flight is tonight, so I'll head straight to the airport from here." 
Sarah's face fell at the news. "I was hoping we could spend more time together tomorrow. But if you must go..." She paused, then added with a knowing look, "Take care! And... meet with Brody!" 
I offered her a bittersweet smile. 
The seven-hour flight to London felt interminable. I barely touched the in-flight meal, my mind too preoccupied with the swirling emotions I couldn't quite name. A sense of determination settled over me as the plane touched down at Heathrow. I needed answers, and I knew where to start looking. 
I directed the taxi to Brody's penthouse - our old home.  
Brody still lived in the penthouse where we once shared a life. I hoped he hadn't changed the security code-I knew it by heart. 
Brody still lives in our old penthouse, but I insisted he keep it when we divorce. This decision has led to an odd situation: I stay at a hotel every time I'm in London, despite Brody's repeated assurances that I'm welcome to use the penthouse. 
Do I have a strange relationship with him? Absolutely. 
As the elevator doors slid open, I was met with an unexpected sight. A woman with cascading blonde hair and striking green eyes sat on the familiar leather couch; her brow furrowed in confusion at my sudden appearance. 
"Oh my God!" I blurted out. 
For a moment, I wondered if I'd somehow entered the wrong apartment. Had Brody sold the place? Thankfully, the woman didn't scream or accuse me of breaking in. She just stared, bewildered. 
"Uh" she muttered. 
Before I could gather my thoughts, Brody emerged from the study, a document in one hand and his phone pressed to his ear. His eyes widened as they landed on me, the color draining from his face. 
"Jane!" The surprise in his voice was unmistakable.  
My gaze darted between Brody and the beautiful stranger on our-his-couch.  
No! 
Damn it! Is he seeing someone now? Given how gorgeous the woman on the couch is, it wouldn't be shocking if she were his new love interest. I have no claim on his life anymore, no right to feel this stupid, sudden rush of jealousy. 
"Uh, I-I'm sorry!" I stammered, heat rising to my cheeks. "I didn't know you had company." 
Brody's mouth opened, but no words came out. I was grateful the elevator was still waiting. I stepped back inside,  jabbing at the close button with trembling fingers. 
"Jane, wait!" Brody called out. I heard him hastily excuse himself from his phone conversation just as the elevator doors slid shut, taking me down to the lobby. 
How could I have been so thoughtless? Yes, Brody had offered me use of the penthouse, and I hadn't even bothered to book a hotel, but I should have checked with him first-I wouldn't be in this mess if I had. 
The taxi ride to the hotel was blurry, my mind spinning with emotion. Brody had moved on-it hit me hard. He wouldn't bring another woman to our old place if she didn't mean something to him, right? 
I felt stupid, hurt, confused, and overwhelmed with regret. Should I blame myself for Brody seeking companionship elsewhere? 
No, I shouldn't complain; he wronged me by not addressing my feelings, which is why I divorced him.  
His failure to address my concerns to settle my unease was what drove me to leave our marriage.  
Cheating isn't always about physical infidelity. It can be emotional too-making your partner feel insecure, uncomfortable, second-guessing their place in your life because of someone else. 
That's precisely what happened between us. I tried my best to communicate, but he ignored me. Brody may not have cheated in the conventional sense, but he still betrayed me, and it hurt just the same. 
I hadn't even noticed I was crying until I tasted the salt on my lips. 
Well, now it seems impossible for us. He's found someone new. 
I revisited my memories from when Brody and I were still married...
SPECIAL ###chapter 2
**Jane** 
When did I genuinely start falling for him so deeply? It was that night four years ago, during a crisp autumn in London. Brody was abroad on a business trip. I was overworked and sick at the time. 
I had just returned from Paris, feeling dizzy as I stepped into our penthouse in Mayfair. I sneezed as I texted him. 
***Me:*** *'Just got back from a business trip. What do you want for dinner?'* 
Almost instantly, Brody replied: *'I'm on a business trip in New York. You didn't tell me you were coming back today.'* 
I had wanted to surprise him, so I kept my return a secret. But he hadn't mentioned his trip to me either. 
***Me:*** *'Alright! Take care!'* 
My nose, already raw and red from constant sneezing, throbbed as I hit send. I dragged myself to the ensuite bathroom, leaving a trail of discarded clothes behind me. The hot shower offered momentary relief, but the room began to spin uncontrollably as I stepped out, wrapped in Brody's oversized bathrobe. 
I collapsed onto our king-sized bed. 
The entire night was a blur of chills, cold sweats, and a desperate urge to get up, though my body wouldn't cooperate. My phone, placed on the mahogany cabinet across the room, rang incessantly. Each shrill tone pierced my aching head, but I was too weak to silence it. 
I had no idea how many hours passed; a blurry outline of a doctor leaned over me. The sharp prick of a needle in my arm was the last thing I registered before succumbing to darkness once more. 
When I finally woke, Brody was beside me, gently wiping my arm with a damp towel. 
"Wh-what happened?" I asked, my throat raw from dryness. 
"It's good you're awake... You caught the flu," Brody said softly, brushing his hand against my forehead to check for a fever. 
As my mind slowly cleared, confusion set in. "Weren't you supposed to be in New York? When did you get here?" 
Brody frowned. "The day you messaged me, I tried calling after my meeting. When you didn't answer, I got worried. I checked the penthouse's security feed and saw you'd arrived and gone straight to the bedroom. After a few more unanswered calls, I knew something was wrong. I dropped everything and returned right away." 
My cheeks flushed with warmth. "I'm so sorry, Brody. I've ended up being such a bother to you." 
"Don't apologize. You haven't inconvenienced me at all. You're my wife, Jane I'm relieved I came home when I did. The doctor said the IV drip was crucial in controlling your fever." 
He could have easily delegated the task to someone else if work kept him occupied, but instead, he had dropped everything and flown across the Atlantic just for me. 
"Is there anything specific you'd like to eat?" Brody asked, his voice laced with concern. "I could order something if you have a craving." 
"Nothing in particular. Whatever you choose is fine." I wondered if he'd order takeout, so I made the decision. "I'm sorry again. I remember I offered to prepare our dinner." 
It's the least I can do as his wife. We're both busy with work, and I'm frequently away in other cities. I do everything I can to keep our relationship harmonious when I'm here. 
Half an hour later, Brody returned, balancing a tray laden with steaming dishes. The aroma of home-cooked food filled the room, making my stomach rumble appreciatively. 
As I savored each bite, I couldn't help but comment, "This is delicious. Where did you order from? The quality is restaurant-level."  
As I sipped water, he said, "I cooked the dinner. I'm glad you liked it." 
I nearly choked on my water, coughing slightly. "You made all this? In just thirty minutes?" 
"Yes," he replied simply. 
My cheeks warmed again.  This successful, busy man had not only rushed home to care for me but had also taken the time to prepare a meal from scratch.  
At that moment, I felt the full force of Brody's care, and I knew I was falling even deeper for him. 
*** 
As I cried alone inside the hotel suite, my thoughts drifted back to Paris on New Year's Eve two years ago. 
We had initially planned to spend the holiday with the Martin family in North Carolina, but an issue arose with one of the models my agency managed. 
I had to go to Paris because I hadn't realized the model was struggling with her mental health, which had manifested in a dangerous eating disorder. 
Brody had to go home, and I had no choice but to fly to Paris alone. 
"Why do you have to go to Paris yourself?" Brody asked, his voice tinged with sadness. 
"She doesn't have any family," I explained, my voice tight with concern. "It's the holiday season, and most of my staff are away. With her mental health so fragile, she needs someone she trusts at the hospital." 
I knew I would miss Brody and his family, but I had to decide who needed me more. I promised myself I'd call Brody to wish him well, a poor substitute for our planned New Year's Eve celebration. 
At the hospital, I stayed by the side of the model, who had become a close friend. We went to the garden area to watch the fireworks in the distance.  
As we waited for midnight, lost in our own thoughts, I was startled by a sudden kiss on my cheek. I nearly got angry, thinking some stranger had done it. But as I spun around to confront the intruder, I found myself face-to-face with Brody's familiar, broad-shouldered frame. 
"B-Brody! What are you doing here?" 
His bright and warm smile against the cold Parisian night made my heart race. He presented me with a bouquet of my favorite flowers-peonies and roses-their sweet scent, starkly contrasting to the antiseptic hospital air. 
"I couldn't let the New Year begin without you by my side," Brody said softly, his eyes never leaving mine. 
After introducing him to my model, who smiled knowingly at us, Brody turned back to me. "Happy New Year, Jane. I hope you can forgive the surprise. I just... I couldn't bear the thought of you being alone tonight." 
The truth was, I had been feeling sad. Philip was likely busy with his family, and Sarah and I hadn't spoken in a while because she was upset with me. I thought I deserved to endure this loneliness. 
"But what about your family, Brody?" I asked, guilt creeping into my voice. "They must be missing you." 
"Jane, you are my family Happy New Year." 
Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring the lights of Paris. I threw my arms around him, burying my face in his chest. 
*** 
After hours of crying and thinking about Brody's genuine care for me when I was his wife. someone knocked on my door. Fear gripped me-I was alone in this suite, and no one, not even my secretary, knew where I was. 
Then I heard his voice, muffled but unmistakable. "Jane, let me speak with you..." 
My heart leaped into my throat. Why is Brody here?
SPECIAL ###chapter 3 
**Jane**  
"Jane!" Brody's voice echoed through the hallway, making me freeze.  
Oh no! He was really here. My heart raced as I approached the door and peeked through the peephole. Brody was on the other side, his broad shoulders filling the frame. His usual neat look was a bit messy-his necktie was crooked, his top button undone, and a hint of stubble darkened his jaw.  
Should I open the door?  
"I know you're there, Jane," he said, his voice low and steady.  
Taking a deep breath, I slowly turned the lock. The click felt loud in the quiet. When the door opened, our eyes met, and the months apart vanished instantly. Brody's eyes scanned my face, lingering on my swollen eyes that showed I'd been crying. I saw a mix of emotions pass over his face: concern, guilt, and something more intense.  
Without a word, he stepped inside. The scent of his cologne enveloped me as he pushed the heavy oak door closed with his foot. Before I could gather my thoughts, his hands cupped my face, thumbs gently stroking my cheekbones. Then his lips were on mine, urgent and demanding.  
The kiss broke down all my defenses. We had kept a careful distance for two long years, meeting only casually during my rare visits to the city. He'd asked about my life and work and offered me quiet support through Sarah's coma, but we had never allowed ourselves this intense, desperate connection.  
"I've missed you so damn much!" he murmured between kisses.  
"Brody" I tried to protest, questions burning on my tongue. I wanted to ask about the woman in his apartment and why he was kissing me now. But my body betrayed me, arching into his touch, craving the familiar planes of his chest and his arms' strength.  
"Wait" I managed, struggling for clarity. "We should-"  
"Later. I need this. I need you!" His eyes were pleading.  
My resolution crumbled. Alright, we'll talk later!  
As his lips trailed fire down my neck, I lost myself in the intoxicating blend of his touch, the lingering sadness in my heart, and the rekindling of what I'd thought was lost forever.  
At that moment, tangled in Brody's arms, I felt more alive than I had in two years.   
***  
When consciousness slowly returned the following day, I became acutely aware of the delicious soreness permeating my body. My hips and thighs ached most satisfyingly, a testament to the passion we'd shared. I couldn't help but smile. Brody had always been gentle, but he was a beast to be reckoned with in bed. I had to admit, I missed him terribly.  
I had tried to move on, to love someone else and date other people, but deep down, it was always Brody I truly wanted.   
I woke up entirely when I noticed he wasn't in bed. Sitting up and clutching the sheet, I looked around the room. My eyes landed on my discarded panties. I reached for it out of habit, but when I saw its state, they were beyond saving from our wild reunion.  
Damn it!  
As I stood there holding the damaged underwear, the bathroom door swung open, and Brody emerged, wrapped in nothing but a towel around his waist. Droplets of water clung to his broad chest, tracing tantalizing paths down his abs. I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry.  
"Hi," he said with a small smile.  
"Uhm" I struggled to find my words. I needed to say something. "D-do you think this is inappropriate?"  
The corners of his mouth lifted slightly. "Perhaps. But I feel like this is the most perfect thing that's happened to me since our divorce."  
"That's the thing, Brody, we're exes! This doesn't change that fact."  
"Sweetheart, that's not what you made me feel last night. You moaned my name so loudly it felt like the whole of London could hear how much you enjoyed it."  
My cheeks flushed immediately, and I tried to muster anger. "You're an ass!"  
He moved closer, perching on the edge of the bed. "I can't take this anymore, sweetheart. I did everything I could and gave you what you wanted. I even tried to make it up to you like you asked. Let's stop this. Two years is too long."  
"You hurt me and I was so afraid, Brody." My tears began to flow uncontrollably.  
"I know, sweetheart I deeply regret how I treated you before I was an idiot, Jane. Men... we don't always understand. We're not like the perfect husbands in romance novels who always know exactly what their wives think."  
I sniffled, wanting to hold onto my anger but feeling it slip away with each passing moment.  
"We were always lost. We test the waters before diving in because we struggle to read women's emotions. I'm not generalizing all men, but that's how it was for me back then. I thought showing you my love, even if I didn't say it outright, would be enough."  
"Don't blame other men! You're the only idiot here!"  
He nodded. "I agree! I gave you space because I couldn't bear the thought of you hating me," Brody continued his thumb gently wiping away a tear that had escaped. "And I needed to face the consequences of my actions. To become someone worthy of your love again."  
"Do you still love me, Brody?" I asked softly.  
"Of course I do!" he answered without hesitation, his gaze never wavering from mine. "Last night, it nearly drove me mad thinking I might lose you again."  
I bit my lip and looked away.  
"I have to admit. The woman you saw at the penthouse was my date last night. She's the daughter of a business partner who asked me to meet her, as she's quite taken with me."  
The woman I'd glimpsed was undeniably stunning, the kind of beauty that turned heads wherever she went. And Brody... well, he was Brody. Successful, charming, and devastatingly handsome.   
I felt like damaged goods. I had wandered through a dark world, made choices I wasn't proud of, and even betrayed Sarah in a moment of weakness. Compared to her, it seemed unlikely that Brody would ever choose me.  
"I tried to have a romantic relationship with her, and I invited her to the penthouse to give a document to his father. I wanted to avoid any rumors if someone saw us at the hotel or outside. But when I brought her there, can you believe it? You were the one on my mind. I excused myself briefly to regain my composure and figure out what to do. And that's when I saw you at the elevator, Jane."  
Hearing those words from Brody was painful, especially when I realized I couldn't love anyone but him. But we had both been lost for two years, and I couldn't hold that against him. I had dated other men, too, trying to find a connection elsewhere.  
"I panicked, especially knowing I had a visitor at that time. I immediately thought about the last day you stayed at the penthouse and saw Sonia then. But this time, I could only think that I couldn't let you slip away. Not again."  
I swallowed hard, finding the courage to ask the question gnawing at me. "D-do you like her? The woman from last night?" I asked.  
"She's attractive, I'll admit. But she's not you, Jane."  
He wiped away my tears. "When you left the penthouse, I nearly lost my mind trying to find you," he said. "And then, seeing you with swollen eyes, I knew I was the one who made you cry again. That's when I realized we need to resolve our issues."  
Brody took my hands, his touch sending a familiar spark through me. "Give me a chance, sweetheart. Please One last chance to make things right between us" 
"You must always take care of me from now on!" I exclaimed, raising with a hint of playful demand. 
"Yes, sweetheart," Brody replied calmly. 
I continued, "And you mustn't worry me! No more inviting random beauties to our penthouse!" 
He chuckled softly, mistaking my concern for jealousy. 
"And," I hesitated before voicing my desires, "I want to get pregnant, Brody. Do you want to be a father?" 
We'd never discussed this subject before during our marriage. I didn't even know if Brody wanted children. But seeing Philip's twins had awakened a longing in me I couldn't ignore. 
Brody's smile grew wider. "Do you have any idea how tasty you look right now, talking about babies?" 
My cheeks flushed. "I'm serious!" 
He moved closer. "Who said I'm not? Jane, having a family with you... it's been one of my deepest wishes. Of course, I want to have a baby with you." 
I smiled at his words. 
"Any other wishes?" he asked, his lips brushing my shoulder in a tender kiss. 
"None," I breathed. "I... I love you, Brody." 
He gently caressed my cheek. "As I love you, Jane. More than you could ever know." 
I realized how close I'd come to losing all of this. That other woman might have won Brody's heart if I'd delayed my return. The thought made me shudder. I didn't want to pretend anymore; I didn't want to hide behind walls of self-protection. 
Sarah was right; chances should be given to those who truly deserve them, and Brody is one of those people.  
He had given me a chance when I was lost and floundering in darkness. I didn't deserve him then, but he had cared for and loved me with a depth that overwhelmed me with its kindness. 
Three months later, Brody and I renewed our vows. This time, there were no arrangements or contracts-just two people genuinely in love committing to a shared future. 
Ten months after that, I gave birth to our baby girl.  
In Brody's arms, with our daughter between us, I finally understood: home isn't a place; it's the people who love you unconditionally
