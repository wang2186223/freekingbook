Alpha Adrian was smiling, looking at the man now standing before us both, but his face fell the second his eyes landed on me, shock and disgust filling his gaze. ‘Alpha King Rhys.” Adrian attempted to mask his disgust. “I must apologize.

Grace spent her whole life in a pack that didn’t value her, and took advantage of her in every way they could think of. Her father, The Alpha at the time, allowed it to happen, and eventually even imprisoned her. When her father died, instead of things getting better, they just got worse. Her stepsister and her brother-in-law made her life a living hell. She never saw a way out as she was wolfless and mute because not speaking was safer than speaking. But she’s not as weak as she thinks she is. When Alpha King Rhys comes for a visit in hopes of finding a bride, her whole life changes. Nothing she knew is as it seemed, and now she’s unravelling the mess she was left with. With the help of the Alpha King, she starts to find herself, piece by piece.
But is she just a pawn in his game? He's had others before her.Is she the one he has been waiting for? Will she survive the mess she's been left in,or will she find herself crumbling before she can ever find the answers that await her?
