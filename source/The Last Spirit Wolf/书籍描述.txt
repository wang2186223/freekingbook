“INCOMING! 10 Injured Wolves and 3 Lycans! “ Sophie, my bestie, our alpha yells in my head “LYCANS?! Did you just say LYCANS?! “Yes Vera! They are coming! Get your people ready.” I couldn’t believe we actually have Lycans tonight I was told growing up that lycans and wolves were mortal enemies Rumors also said in order to protect their pureblood, Lycans were not allowed to marry wolves in generations. I was still surprised but I couldn’t let my mind wander anymore. I’m a doctor.
A badly injured werewolf comes barging in through the E.R door, holding an unconscious wolf. I rush to them and the nurses that were already in their dresses and heels come to their aid. What the hell happened? I turn my full attention to the severely injured lycan and for a moment, it’s as if I can feel his slowing heart beat in my own chest. I check his vitals as a nurse reluctantly hooks him to all the machines. As I put my hand on his head to lift his eyelid and check for pupil response, I feel electricity run below my fingertips. What the….? Without warning, his eyes shoot open startling me and sending both our heart rates through the roof. He looks at me intently; I would never think those eyes are of a man who is barely alive.
He whispers something too low for me to hear. I get closer and as he whispers again; he flat lines and my head is reeling Did he just whisper... *mate?*
