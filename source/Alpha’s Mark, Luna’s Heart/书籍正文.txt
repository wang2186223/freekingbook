### Chapter 1

“Kristen, are you ready?” Jacob asked. He was being very impatient with me. His sh aggy black hair was getting into his crystal clear blue eyes. Looking over, I watched him run his hands through his hair. Jacob was hot, I’ve give him that. Very muscular and tall at 6’1” but not exactly my type. Fun to flirt with but not my type.

“Just about.” I was the alpha’s daughter. My brother was Jacob’s best friend and the leader of our little pack of friends. Colt was every girl’s we t dr eam. Short brown hair with extremely dark brown eyes. I guess I could see how his jaw line and beard stubble made me look good. His was completely bulked out as well.

However, since I was his twin, we looked very similar. Colt often got teased since I am the female version of him and extremely sought after by the guys.

However, Colt was four minutes older than me so he get’s the Alpha’s position. Leaving me to do what I please and that happens to be tattooing. I started tattooing around 15 years old and Colt and I would be 18 here soon. I was on my last session with Jacob.

“I’m excited to get this done. I have a date this weekend and I want it to look good.” Jacob had a new flavor every weekend, to the point that I didn’t bother learning their names.

We went to a high school that was part human and part werewolves. However, three different packs attended the school so you had to be careful. There was us, the Blue Fang pack. Then the Midnight River pack and finally the Black Moon pack. For the most part, the packs got along but there was still always a sense of authority that was tested.

“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you look good. Can’t be representing our pack badly.” Jacob was getting our Crest tattooed on his chest. It was the head of a wolf with its teeth showing and blue blood dripping

from the fangs. Kind of spot on for whoever designed it but whatever.

“Thanks, Ice.” Ice was my nickname. Colt was fire. As in, red hot, se xy and playful. Ice is for my cold heart that I chose not to give out. I had long naturally curly hair, all the curves with legs for days. I could have the pick of whoever I wanted. However, Colt usually put a stop to it.

One time, he literally beat my boyfriend to the point he was unrecognizable because he saw us k*ssing. Since then, I haven’t found anyone really wanting to go up against him.

Jacob was leaning back in the chair as I finished up setting everything up when my brother and the rest of his pose came in. “You ski p the last hour?” Colt asked me.

Rolling my eyes, I leaned over and started working on Jacob. He flinched at first and growled at me. “You are not going to want to do that.” I warned him. I might be a girl but the alpha blood and training in me will put all these boys on their assess.

“I wasn’t ready.”

“Suck it up.” I said as I kept going.

“Ice, I asked a question.” Colt sat down in a chair. Ace was who I wanted but was forever untouchable to me. His was the beta’s son and would be Colt’s beta. His honey brown hair matched his eyes. Only slightly shorter than Colt, he was just as muscular and much more reserved and quiet. He was the type to sit in the corner, drink and watch everyone else get stu pid. It’s the silent types for me. He sat down directly in front of Jacob. With his foot on the bar under the chair, his arms folded, made me want to climb on his lap and f u ck him.

“I heard you. I didn’t want to go.” Dripping my gun into the blue ink, I kept going.

“Why not? Something happen?” Colt’s voice became dangerous. These three guys and my best friend Emmy, we were a group. Gang might be too much of a word but no one messed with us. We made sure of it.

Thankfully, the door opened and Emmy walked in. Jacob had the hots for her but she denied him so often that he would go out with these other girls to make her jealous. However, all it did was repulse her. I have her a grateful nod.

She was the most perky person. With strawberry blond hair that was as curly as can be, she was one of the best female warriors… under me. Her light skin that was covered in freckles, really made her blue eyes pop. noveldrama

“How’s it going?”

“Just finishing up si ssy boy’s tattoo.” I said with a smile as I kept going.

“That looks amazing.” Emmy came over and looked at it as I leaned back and cleaned it off with a paper towel.

“Si ssy boy?” Jacob gave me a look.

“Down boy, just a joke.” I laughed as I kept going. The bell ringed again, this time, the person entering was someone from another pack.

“Hello, I heard this was the place to go for a tattoo?” We all looked at him. Oh, f u c k. He gave Ace a run for his money. His black hair was gelled back, his green eyes landed on me and my world paused. His leather jacket did little to hide just how muscular he was. It was his jeans that caught my attention. They were on the tighter side but the biker boots finished his look.

Shaking off the initial reaction, “What are you looking for?”

“I was told to ask for a Chris. They were the best.”

“That would be me.” I said with an edge. Most people in my school called me Kris, my close friends called me Ice. Very few people called me Kristen.

The shock was clear but he managed to regain himself. “I was hoping to get a piece like this.” Pulling out a massive drawling, he walked up to me so I could look at it.

“Where do you want it?” I asked. It was a whole mural of a wolf howling at the moon.

“My back. I want it to cover the whole thing. I just got back from a five year training and I want to get inked.”

“What is your name?” Colt asked.

The stranger looked over at him. “Name is Alec. Son of Alpha Marc from the Black Moon Pack. He walked over to shake Colt’s hand.

Colt stood up. I got a little nervous, as Colt doesn’t have the best reputation. “Colt Jefferys. Son of Alpha Brian of Blue Fang pack. That is my twin sister, Kristen Jefferys.” Colt nodded towards me. “Emmy, Future Gam ma Jacob and Future Beta Ace.”

“I don’t mean to step on toes coming here. I am finishing my last year in school here before transferring.”

I coudn’t stop myself. “Transferring where?” Colt shot me a look but I ignored him.

Alec gave me a half smile. “More training.”

“That piece will cost around $1,500 and take me a few sessions. Depends on your pain tolerance.” I said without looking at them. Instead, I started up again on Jacob. I just needed to finish the shading

and I was done.

“Do you have a references?” Alec asked.

Rolling my eyes, I pointed at the book on the stand. Most guys wanted to see my work before they agreed to anything. I was used to it but still annoyed me. Alec took a few minutes and fl*pped through the pages. I have always been able to read people extremely easy. Colt said it was because I was an Alpha Female. Either way, Alec was mysterious, and dangerous yes but not at the same time.

“Okay, I am done.” I told Jacob. Putting some soap on the tattoo, I washed it before cleaning it off and applying a healing tape. “You know the drill. Don’t make me fix your f uc k ups. Keep the bi tches from using fingernails this time.” I glared at him.

“That was one time!” Jacob got up and looked in the mirror. In the mean time, I washed my hands and grabbed my camera to take a picture.

“Hold still.” I said moving him in the light.

Click!

“Perfect.” I knew they had to leave but I could tell Colt didn’t want to leave me alone with Alec. “I’m fine, bro.” I said in the mind-link. Putting gloves on, I started cleaning up my mess.

“I don’t trust him.”

“Emmy will be with me and dad will kill you if you are late again.”

“Fine. I want to know the exact minute he is gone.” It was a command but we both knew that didn’t work on me.

“Yes, sir.” I said sarcastically.

The three boys got up and headed towards the door. “I shouldn’t have to tell you to treat my sister appropriately.” Colt said to Alec.

Alec’s eyes narrowed at the threat but didn’t act on it. “I don’t make it habit of disrespecting woman.”

“Ice.” He looked at me and nodded before leaving.

“Sorry about that. Have you made a decision?” I asked as I threw away all my used items.

“Yeah, I would like to book it.” Spraying down the chair, I whipped it clean. “Are you the only artist here?” He asked as I was making my way up to the counter.

“Yes. This is my shop and mine only. Maybe one day I will expand.” Fl*pping open my calendar, I saw I had an opening tomorrow. “I can do tomorrow at 4pm. We will see how much you can sit through and go from there an future appointments.”

“Okay. I train in the morning so that will work.”

“Here are forms you need to fill out. Leave what you have sketched and come back with them filled out and the cash.” Handing him an envelop, and he handed me the picture.

“What are these forms?” Alec asked.

“Saying you understand who I am, what pack I am from. That you are doing this freely and all the small print stuff. This is a legitimate business that I file taxes on. Just the same as the packs do.”

“Okay, then. See you tomorrow.” Alec headed towards the door.

“Alright.” I said walking out from behind the counter. I didn’t have any appointments this afternoon. Emmy and I were going to go for a run and hang out.

As soon as he was out the door, Emmy started in. “Holy f u ck. If you don’t f u ck him, I will!” She was a little horn dog but she did have a line. As much as she k*ssed around, she still had her virginity. All talk and not much action.

“Colt would literally kill him.” I said as I grabbed my purse. It was the beginning of summer and dam n if it wasn’t still 80 degrees at 7pm. I had drove my motorcycle and so did Emmy.

“Wouldn’t that be a dream match?” Walking out, I locked up my shop. Looking at the design, I couldn’t have been happier with what I have accomplished. Emmy walked to her bike and I stood in front of mine.

My purse was a backpack style so after adding my keys and stuff to it, I grabbed my helmet and put it on. It wasn’t until my legs were straddling my bike that I noticed Alec across the street, looking directly at me.

It gave me goosebumps. “Something like that.” I said. I knew he could hear us know. The shop was build to be sound proof, the outside, not so much. “Come on, I need to run off some energy.” Starting my engine, I waited till she was ready before we rode past him. His eyes stayed on me the whole time.

There was something in them that I didn’t understand. Something primal.







###Chapter 2

“Where have you girls been?” As soon as our bikes pulled up to the pack house, my mother was already jumping down my throat. For a Luna, she was especially over bearing and always nagging on me about something I did wrong. I was never good enough in her eyes.

She was a tiny thing a just under 5’5” and not an ounce of fat on her. Luna An n was a force to be wrecked with if she has her mind made up. Usually, she always believes I am wrong without even hearing my side. Thankfully, Colt can see through her. She is technically our step-mother as our mother died giving birth to us. Dad mated with her not even a year later. Colt was a spinning image of our dad. Even though we looked similar, I looked more like my mother growing up.

“Just finished up at the shop. We are going to go for a run and meet some friends for supper.” I said stopping in front of her.

“I don’t think so! You haven’t finished any of the work that I put on the list for you!” A little vein threatened to burst in her forehead.

“I did it this morning! Before school! Did you even check before you accuse me of something?” I yelled, instantly pis sed.

“What is going on here?” Dad, Colt and the boys walked out of the pack house.

“Once again, she is ignoring her duties I gave her and being disrespectful! This is the last time!” She raised her hand to slap me across the face. Fortunately, Colt stepped in and caught her hand before she do it.

“You will not hit her.” Colt said with narrow eyes.

“You little brat!”

“An n, enough. Kris, did you do your chores?” Dad asked as he folded his hands over his chest.

“Yes, sir. I did them this morning before school.”

“She is lying!” Luna An n shrieked.

“No, I’m not!” I yelled back as I grabbed my phone. “See?” I held up my email to show my dad. Intentionally, walking around An n as I didn’t want to show her.

“Looks like she did it.” Dad nodded. “What are you doing this evening?”

“Emmy and I were going to go for a run and then meet the guys at the pizza parlor.”

“That is what I told you.” Colt stood up for me.

“Okay. Have a good run.” Dad said handing me back my phone.

“I also emailed you the report from today. I should let you know that Alpha Marc’s son came in and asked for a full back tattoo. I gave him the papers and he is coming in tomorrow to get it started.”

Dad looked at me for a minute. “What time?”

“4pm, sir.”

“Okay, I will swing by sometime.” Dad nodded and turned to leave.

“That’s it? No punishment for being disrespectful?” Ann chased after Dad.

“What did you do to get her fired up like that?” Colt asked.

“We literally just pulled up. She was waiting here when we got here. I can’t wait to get out of this f uc king place. Come our 18th birthday, I am gone.” I said to Colt as Emmy and I headed to our rooms to

change.

“Running away isn’t the answer.”

“What is going to change? You won’t be Alpha for another seven years. Dad already said you will get it once you are 25 and not sooner. I’m not waiting around for seven more years of this.”

“What if your mate is here?” Colt asked. We were at my bedroom and all three guys looked like I punched them in the face.

“I hope he will like to travel, I will be traveling the world for seven years.” Going into my closet, I changed into a of black spandex shorts, a neon pink sports bra that popped out of the black sport razer back tank I put on.

When I got out, I grabbed a hair tie and loosely tied it back into a pony tail. “Look, I know you don’t like it but what else do you want me to do? A girl can only handle so much with no one in her corner.”

“I’m in your corner.” Colt said.

“And I love you for it but you know you can only do so much. You aren’t there to stop the physical hits.”

“I hate that.” Colt looked down at his shoes.

“It’s fine. You have hit me harder than that.” I joked as I grabbed my phone and ear buds.

“Not that same thing.” Colt’s eyes narrowed.

“I love you, bro but I don’t have any options.” Finally, grabbing my black and pink tennis shoes, I put them on. “I need to go run.” I debated if I wanted to put on another sports bra as my watermelons occasionally hurt when running.

“Ready?” Emmy bounced in my room.

“Yes!” I was happy she was here.

“See you boys!”

“We will be at the pizza parlor in an hour!” Jacob yelled after us.

“Got it!” As we ran out of the packhouse, I could still hear An n going off to my dad about me when we passed his office. His door wasn’t fully shut but I didn’t want to risk getting into trouble, so we kept going.

“What path?” Emmy asked as she fixed her air-pods.

“Let’s run down town today. We can take the long way to the parlor.” Center was the name of the town that all of the packs used. It wasn’t part of anyone’s territory and it’s where our school is located.

“Sounds good.”

We took off running at the same speed. Our long legs stride out. With each step, my worries and anxiety fade away. Everything that was stressing me out was gone. Just the sound of my feet pounding on the hard Earth. Even the music playing in my ear drifted to the background.

It was a total of ten miles until we hit the town. Once our feet hit the old brick road, we stopped running to catch our breath. “That felt like it lasted forever.” Emmy was really winded.

I was winded but not near as bad. “Eating too much candy?” I teased. The pizza parlor was only three blocks in town. It was a popular hangout for high school age kids. Even the humans gathered around. So it was no surprise when we got there that it was packed.

Looking around, I saw Jacob with his arm around a girl in the far corner. Weaving between people, we made our way over to our group. “About time you girls show up!” The girl on Jacob’s arm looked us up and down. She was human and already annoyed me.

“Gotta keep this figure up. Where is my drink?” I looked around and didn’t see anything.

“Colt hasn’t gotten here yet.” Ace was sitting across from Jacob. There was a girl trying to get his attention. I smirked at him and lifted an eyebrow. He shook his head at me, telling me he wasn’t feeling it.

“I think there is a seat over there, why don’t you girls go over there?” The human girl under Jacob’s arm bravely said.

Jacob and Ace shared a look. “Excuse me?” I said like I didn’t hear her.

“Whoa! Just go get some drinks and order three large pizzas for us. I’ll handle it.” Jacob answered quickly. noveldrama

“Yes, please do.” I said before turning around. Emmy stayed behind as I walked up to the counter. I wasn’t paying attention to who was in front of me when when they stepped back and landed on my foot. I wasn’t happy.

“The f u-”

The green eyes looked back and looked down at me holding my toe before looking at my b*dy. I felt butterflies in my stomach. “My apolog-”

“Watch where you are walking!” A girl came up to us and wrapped her arm around Alec’s waist.

What is with these b itches? “He stepped on me!” I said standing up. She was a wolf and I had no problem putting her in her place.

“Angela, this is Alpha Brian’s daughter, Kris.”

Her voice changed but not her attitude or the hatred in her eyes. “Nice to meet you.” She said through her teeth. Not even sticking her hand out.

“Yeah.” I said. The counter was clear so I walked around them.

“Hey, Kris! Usual?” The cashier was from our pack and in my grade. Her name is Wendy.

“Yes, please!”

“Alpha Colt’s tab?”

“That would be great.”

“Stu pid bi tch thinks she owns the place.” I heard whispered behind me. Wendy’s eyes got wide as I turned around.

“Let’s try this again.” I pushed my aura out on her. I kept it light since there are humans around. “My name is Kris and as the daughter of Alpha Brian, I would expect some respect. If that is too hard for you, feel free to step outside and we can handle it.”

“No need for that. I will handle her disrespect. Please accept my apologizes on her behalf.” Alec looked murderous as he held her upper arm like a child. She was still bending her neck in submission.

Pulling back my aura, I stepped back so the audience we had gained, looked away. “I don’t give second changes.” I said looking directly in Alec’s eyes.

“Noted.”

“Um, Kris?” Wendy softly called behind me.

I heard Alec drag the b itch with him outside. “Thank you for the glasses.” I said with a smile. Taking them, I went to fill them up. Most people know me and know of my reputation so it’s not often I am messed with.

“Need help?” Turning, I saw Colt walking up behind me with his girlfriend, Kara.

“Please.” I said as I handed them the glasses.

“What is up with Alpha Alec?” Colt asked.

“His bi tch was being disrespectful. I told her to step outside and he said he would handle it so I let him handle it.” We were walking back to the table. The round table that Jacob picked was a little tight so we were sitting shoulder to shoulder. Somehow, I got pushed against Ace. He lifted his arm and rested on the boot behind me. It wasn’t a romantic gesture but more of a necessity so we could eat.

“How was your run?” The girl on Jacob’s arm asked me, shyly.

“It was good. Helps me clear my head.” I said, making nice. I could clearly see Jacob relax at my tone.

“I wish I enjoyed running but it’s never been for me.” She took a sip of her drink.

“So, Kris, hows business?” Kara asked me. We aren’t super close since I don’t think she will last either. Colt gets bored and honestly, until he finds his mate or tells me he actually loves them, I don’t get too attached.

“Great. Already ahead of last year.” The pizza arrived then.

“I said three larges!” Jacob said looking at it all.

“You three men will eat a large to yourself.” Colt usually orders five larges and they will always get ate fully. Not sure why Jacob only wanted three.

The gang started chatting and I stared off into space. It wasn’t until my eyes landed on a set of green ones that I me ntally came back to it. He signaled for me to follow him outside as he was standing by the front door.

“I need to get out for a second.” I said. Colt, Kara and Emmy slide out so I could get out too.

“Do you need me to go?” Ace asked in my mind-link.

“No. Probably wants to make sure I don’t kill his girlfriend.”

I felt this disapproval from him. We weren’t together but occasionally when we got drunk, we would make out. It never went past that but he always had a slight jealousy when it came to me.

Walking out, I spotted Alec sitting on his bike. “Wasn’t sure if you were going to come out or not.” He said. The hairs on my arms were instantly raised.








###Chapter 3.

I chose to ignore that comment. “What can I do for you?”

“Angela can be a hot head but she is transferring too and I don’t want there to be problems at school.” I almost felt disappointed…almost.

“As long as she knows her place. If not, I’m sure she will find it soon enough.” It wasnt a threat but a promise.

Alex nodded his head in understanding. “Why did your brother call you Ice?”

“That name is reserved for close friends.”

“That didn’t answer my question.”

“I’m not exactly the warm and fuzzy type.” I kept it vague.

“Ice?” I guess Ace was done waiting. Alex didn’t bristle up, merely glanced over and studied his b*dy language.

“Your boyfriend?”

“No. See you tomorrow.” I said before turning back around. Ace held the door open for me. Alec’s bike peeled out as Ace shut the door.

“What was that about?” Colt asked, clearly unhappy.

“His bit ch is transferring to and he doesn’t want a scene.” I shrugged.

“What did you tell him?” Jacob asked in a not so friendly tone.

“As long as she knows her place, we are good. That I would hate to remind her of it.”

“Hate…s hit.” Ace shook his head in disbelief.

“Your reputation should be enough to keep her away.” Emmy laughed.

“One little fight and I am the school bad girl.” I sighed.

“It wasn’t one fight and you put her into a coma.” Colt smirked.

“Bit ch needed to know her place.” I wasnt hungry but I didnt want to go home.

“Lets head out.” Jacob drank the last of his soda.

“You girls need a ride?” Colt offered.

“No, I want to walk home.”

“Its getting dark out..” Ace looked out the window.

“Thanks, dad. I wasn’t aware.” Annoyed, I got up and started out the door. Emmy was quick to follow me.

“You know you will be in trouble if you are late.” Emmy frowned.

She was right but I hated A nn. “I’ll be in trouble even if I am early.” I hear the boy’s bikes come up behind us.

“Come on, sis. Get on.” Colt held out a hand for me. Sighing, I gave in and got on. Emmy got on Ace’s bike and we took off for the pack house.

The ride only lasted five minutes and I was back to my hell. Colt dropped us off at the front and he went around to the garage. As soon as we walked in the front door, something moved from the side.

SLAP!

The sting of a hand slapping across my face caused my head to whip to the right. I was caught so off guard that I stag gered a little.

“Stu pid girl! How dare you disrespect me!” Luna An n shrieked.

Pure hatred filled my eyes as I looked at her. I wasnt sure what came over me as I walked up to her and returned the slap. However, mine was more powerful and she fell to the floor crying.

“WHAT IS GOING IN HERE?” dad roared. I knew I was in trouble but I didnt regret it.

“I literally walked in the door and she slapped me! I can’t take this anymore dad! I am done being disrespected by someone who isn’t even my mother! I hate it here! Come my birthday, I am gone and you won’t ever see me again. So punish me as you want but I don’t care anymore!” The boys came in the room as I ranted. Tears ran down my face with the blood from the split l*p she gave me. Not even waiting for a response, I ran up to my room, slamming the door shut.

My b*dy was buzzing and I needed to hit something. Thankfully, Colt installed a punching bag to help me focus my anger on it. My mind went black as I punched it over and over again.

It wasn’t until two massive arms wrapped around me and pinned me against him that I came back. My knuckles were blo ody and my arms ached.

“Ice! Calm down!” Colt had me tight against his chest. “I’m so sorry, sis.”

My breathing leveled out and my eye sight focused. Jacob and Ace where here too. “Emmy went home.” Ace read my mind.

“Take a shower and go to bed.” Colt said, letting me go. Ace came up and took my chin in his hand. He moved it to look at my l*p.

“It’s nothing.” I said, jerking my head out of his hand.

“I convinced dad to let you cool down. You need to see him in the morning.”

“Okay.” I was grateful for that. “Thanks.”

The boys nodded as they left my room. My phone dinged. Not even looking at it, I tossed it on the bed and went to take a shower.

The hot water burned against my knuckles but I welcomed the pain. The water eventually ran cold and I got out. Drying off, and putting jammies on, I got into bed. My phone dinged again. This time, I looked at it.

Emmy: You okay?

Me: Yeah, I’m okay.

Emmy: don’t believe you but we can talk tomorrow. Maybe Ace can ease your mind?!

Me: goodnight….

She did get me to smile as I fell asleep instantly.

The next morning, I woke up early to get ready. An n slept in so I knew dad would be alone in his office. Braiding my hair to the side, I applied a light layer of makeup to try to hide the light bruise on my chin. Finally, I put in flowy shorts with a black b*dysuit. Grabbing a pair of sandals, I made my way to his office

Knock!

Knock!

Knock!

“Come in” dad’s voice boomed

“Hi dad.” I said as I walked in and took a seat. Since it was just him and I, I didn’t have to show all the respectful practices.

“Kris, what’s going on?”

“She makes my life a living hell. Just because I look like mom. All I did was walk in the door and she attacked me. I know I shouldn’t have hit her but I’m done being a doormat for her abuse.” My voice cracked but I held firm.

“Colt said you are leaving when you turned 18.”

“Yes. I can’t live with her anymore.”

“You know you can’t go around and hit A nn.” Dad started.

“For once, can you just be my dad? Actually hear me and listen to me?” I interrupted.

“Kris, you know I love you.”

Standing up, “Alpha, can you please just give me my punishment and let me get to school?” If he wasnt going to be the dad I needed, I wasnt going to address him as such.

“Don’t do that.” He shook his head in disappointment.

A knock saved me from answering. The door opened without dad answering. It was Beta Andrew. “Sorry, I can come back…”

“I need to get to school.” I said looking at dad.

“We aren’t done talking.” He said as I turned to leave.

“Yes, sir.”

Rushing out of the office, I went straight to the garage. Getting on my bike, I took off. Not waiting for anyone else.

I felt free with the wind in my hair. In my hast to leave, I forgot my helmet. Not like I dont heal quickly. My knuckled were scabbed over but still looked angry.

Since I left so early, there werent many cars in the school parking lot. Parking my bike, I got off and went to the picnic table and sat down. Plugging my ear phones in, I blasted some old rock songs and got lost in my drawings. Since I was a tattoo artist, I liked to have a bunch of my own work available for people to chose from.

This one was of a Phoenix. The wings were spread wide with fire around him. I was so lost in the shadowing that I didn’t see or feel Ace approaching.

“S HIT!” I yelled as he tapped my shoulder, causing me to jump.

He sat down across from me. I saw his eyes examine my l*p and my knuckles. It made me slightly uncomfortable but loved as well. “You okay?”

“Always am.” I said as I out my music away.

“Kristen.” Anytime someone uses my full name, I know they are serious.

Setting my pencil down, I looked at him in the eyes. “What do you want me to say? I’m lovely? Couldnt be better? I’m flat out miserable? Is it too much to ask to ask for a dad who will take my side for once?”

I was starting to get worked up again. Ace reached over and took my hand.

“It’s okay. I wish I could take your pain away.”

It sounded so intimate. “Seven more years till Colt takes over.” I sighed, steering the conversation away from us.

“Your birthday is coming up. What if your mate is in this pack?” We had talked about us being mates but it didnt feel right.

“School will be over in a few months. Maybe he will want a vacation.”

“What if he can’t take one?” He was talking about himself and he was right. Once Colt turned 18, his alpha training would sore and I’d barely see him. That meant Jacob and Ace too.

“I’ll send postcards.”

I hadn’t realized the school yard was filling up. The first bell rang, telling us we had five minutes before class started.

Ace frowned as we stood up and made our way in. I felt eyes on me, as I looked back and saw Alec looking at me. Angela was clinging to him. I wanted to punch her in the face but instead, I turned around and went to class.

The morning went by slowly. The teachers lectures were boring. I’m in all the advanced classes so I really needed to pay attention but I couldn’t.

My last class, Advanced Calculus, was all I had left before lunch. The door opened and Alec walked in with another guy I didn’t recognize. Alec looked around and saw me before taking a seat on the other side of the room. His s exy friend sat beside him. I sat towards the back as I had a hard time focusing in the front. It bothered me not knowing what was happening behind me so I would sit in the back.

Occasionally, I would feel his eyes in me but I tried to focus. The teacher was going over last semesters progress so I pulled out my sketch pad and kept working on the Phoenix. Most people didnt know my IQ was that of a genius. Three years ago, I tested out of high school but I didnt want to be a freak so I chose to stay and go year by year.

All the teachers knew that so they didn’t call on me and didn’t worry when I sk ipped class. Not to mention they were all wolves and knew who I was. Dad and the other alphas commanded them to not tell a soul about my IQ. It wasn’t something I wanted to share.

When the bell finally rang, the teacher called on me. “Miss Kris. Can you come see me for a second?”

Everyone but Alec and his friend left. “Hello, Miss Simpson. I am Alec and this is Jasper. I wanted to introduce myself to you.”

“That’s right. Alpha Marc’s son?” She looked at him

“Yes, ma’am”

“Nice to meet you. I will say that being the Alphas son doesn’t excuse missed homework.” She glared at him. I stood awkwardly off to the side.

“Understood.” He was clearly annoyed but didn’t push it.

“Miss Kris. Can I count of you again this year?”

I had to smirk, “Yes, ma’am. Looking forward to it.” noveldrama

“Perfect. I’ll send you an email with details.”

“Sounds good!” I said and left.

“Wait!” Alec jogged to catch up with me. “Kris, this is Jasper. He will be my beta. Jasper, this is Alpha Brian’s daughter.”

“Nice to meet you.” He said politely.

I raised my eyebrow at his level of professionalism. “You too. If you would excuse me…” I turned to leave. My stomach was rumbling.

“Still in for this afternoon?” Alec called out.

“Yes, sir.” I said without looking back. I knew they were following me but I didnt care. I wanted food.







###Chapter 4

The line wasn’t long so I was able to get my tray and find a seat rather quickly. The cafeteria was like all the rest. Each pack sat in their own corner and humans filled in the rest.

“Ice!” Jacob called out and waved me over.

“Girl, you don’t look too bad.” Emmy said looking at my l*p.

“I’ve had worse.” I shrugged. I felt safe here with them all. My own personal b*dy guards.

“Did you talk to dad?” Colt asked.

“A little before Andrew came in”

“What punishment did he give you?” Emmy asked looking nervous.

“Nothing… yet.” The hamburger tasted bland but I welcomed the food. The conversation filtered to something else as my mind went to all the things I needed to do.

“Kris, you in?” Ace asked, snapping me out if my thoughts.

“What?”

“Going to the club tomorrow.” Today was Friday and usually we go out on Saturday’s.

“I dont have a dress. You guys keep spilling your drinks in them!” Narrowing my eyes at them.

“We can go shopping tonight!” Emmy clapped her hands together.

“Can’t, I have a tattoo.”

“It’s okay, I’ll go for us both. I know your size!”

“Dont you dare get me anything pink.” I warned as I pointed my knife at her.

Everyone laughed and I actually felt myself relax a little. Going out always helped me relax and ignore my problems.

All too soon, lunch was over. Standing up, I emptied my trap and went to my next class. None of my friends were in my classes. So I always sat by myself.

This was a college level accounting class. In total, one three other students qualified to be in here. Until today.

Alec walked in right as I sat down with Jasper in tow. Since class still had a few minutes, they sat next to me.

“Are you in all the advanced classes?” Alec asked.

“Yes.”

“Why this one?” He pushed

“I own my own shop and you wonder why I am in accounting?” Lifting an eyebrow at him.

“What happened to your l*p?” Jasper asked.

Alec’s eyes instantly went to it and the anger in his eyes was clear. “Nothing.”

“And your knuckles?” Jasper pushed.

“Lets get started!” Mr. Engle started taking, saving me from answering.

“Before we begin, Ms. Kris, can I count on you this year?” He asked me.

“Its on my to-do list.” I confirmed.

I felt Alec give me a sideways glance but otherwise, they left me alone. Thankfully, when class was over, the teacher wanted to speak with Alec so I was able to sl*p away undetected.

That is, until 4pm when he will be in my shop. Which is in thirty minutes.

Currently, I was sitting on my front desk chair. I had to take his drawing and move it to transfer paper. The guys hadn’t shown up yet and neither has my dad.

I was just printing it out when the door opened. “Hello.”

Alec and Jasper walked in the front door. I didn’t really uncomfortable about them. Maybe I should but I didn’t.

“Hey, use the bathroom if you need to. Do you have the paperwork and money?”

“Right here.” Alec placed the paperwork and the cash on the desk.

“Perfect.” Taking the paperwork out, I looked it over to make sure his signature is where I needed it.

Alec went to the restroom. “This place is yours?” Jasper asked as I finish counting the money.

“Yup. Those are all my work.” Jasper was fl*pping through my book.

“Impressive.”

The door open and the guys walked in. “Colt, this is Jasper, Alec’s future beta. Jasper, this is my twin Colt. We are Alpha Brian’s kids. Then future beta Ace and gam ma Jacob.” Jasper shook their hands when Alec walked back in.

“Colt.” Alec greeted and shook their hands again.

“Ready?” I asked Alec.

“Yeah.”

“Take your shirt off and lay face down.” He did as I asked and I started opening my tools.

“How do you guys like it so far?” Colt was trying to make small talk.

“Different but nice.” Jasper said.

“You all look like a pole is stuck up your as ses, relax and take a seat.” I eyed all four of them. Alec snorted but his head was in the hole.

Taking the stencil, I positioned it and pressed it down. Slowly peeling it back, I made sure it looked centered. “Go look in the mirror and see how you like it.”

Alec got up and walked over to the 360 mirrors I had installed. Dam n his b*dy was s exy as f u c k. His muscles were perfectly shaped.

“Looks good.”

He laid back down and I got to work. To his credit, he barely flinched as I started.

“Ice, did you get the emails from the teachers?” Colt asked me.

“Yeah, two of them even asked me in class.”

“Yeah, what was that about?” Jasper asked.

I barely glanced up at him. “Miss Perfect over here has been in charge of organizing the school events for the last five years now.” Jacob always was bitter I was smarter than him. He was stu pid smart too but not like me.

“Five years? You’re only a senior.” Jasper was confused.

“Its really not a big deal. I excelled at school so I took over the events. I don’t do all the planning but most of it. I have assistants who do the leg work. I write the test, do the spelling bees, prom.” I shrugged. It was really me telling a handful of students what to do.

“You have done this since 8th grade?” Alec asked. noveldrama

“Yeah. One of my many talents. Anyway. There is a spelling bee in a month that I needed to pick out words and prom is coming up. Plus our end of the school year prep rally.”

“Ice, we need to head out, are you okay?” Colt asked in the mind link.

“Yeah, I’m good.” I responded.

They all stood up, “see you at supper.” Colt waved goodbye before leaving. Ace gave me one last look before he took off too.

“That your boyfriend?” Jasper smirked.

“No. I’ve known all those guys since we were born. Actually our birthdays are within a week of each others.”

“So, how smart are you?” Jasper pried.

“Excuse me?” I gave him a look that said how s tupid he was for asking.

“You are in all the advanced classes and do all that work…”

“I’m a mysterious woman.” The door opened and my dad walked in. “Hey, dad.”

Jasper immediately stood up and Alec made a move to do the same. “Stay where you are.” Dad waved Alec off. He lowered himself back down but his b*dy was stiff. Dad shook Jaspers hand.

“Nice to meet you, Alpha Brian.” Jasper’s demeanor changed.

“Relax boys. Just came to check on my daughter.” Dad walked up and looked at my work. “Nice piece. Who drew it?”

“I did, sir.” Alec said with his head turned to the side.

“How much longer you working tonight?”

“Not sure. I’d like to get all the line work done before we call it.” I had most of it anyway. “Maybe some shading depending on his pain level.”

“Okay. I brought you supper.” Dad lifted a bag and set it on my desk.

“Thanks.” I said and kept working.

“Don’t worry about coming to my office.” I stopped and looked up. Really? No punishment? “I shouldn’t have to tell you boys to be respectful.”

“No sir.” Jasper answered. Dad nodded and walked out.

“Can I order pizza to be delivered here?” Jasper asked.

“Sure, address is on my business card but go outside and order. Sh itty service in here.” Jasper nodded, taking a card, he went outside.

As soon as he was gone, Alec turned to his side and touched my l*p. It was both S**ual and full of concern.”Who did that?”

I wasn’t going to spill family drama. “Nothing for you to worry about.”

“I asked around and learned about your reputation.” I lifted an eyebrow at him. “Rumor is your dad hits you.”

That honestly surprised me. Enough that my jaw dropped. “My dad has never once laid a hand on me in that manner.” I said it so with much conviction that Alec must have believed me.

“Then your mom?”

“She isn’t my mom. My mom died when I was little.” Grabbing his shoulder I tried to lay him down. He refused.

“Do you need help?”

“I’m fine. In case you haven’t noticed, my brother and his posse are protective enough.”

Alec laid down after that. “That I did notice. So, are you with Ace?”

“Like I said, no but not sure why you care.”

“Just like to make sure I don’t step on toes”

“Is Angela not your girl?”

“A wanna be girl but not by me.” Alec grumbled.

“So you allow girls to hang off you? Must like to play around. Let me guess, different flavor each week?” I said unimpressed.

“No, actually. I am very picky in who I take on dates.”

“How old are you?”

“Turned 18 last month.”

“No mate yet?”

“Nope. Still looking.”

“Are you though? Sounds like you are busy with training.”

“This last training is only for a week and then I’ll be home for good.” Jasper walked back in.

“Pizza is ordered. What are you guys talking about?”

“When is your 18th birthday?”

“Tomorrow, actually.”

“Oh, happy early birthday then.”

“Thanks, still trying to decide on what we are going to do.”

Right on cue, Emmy walked in. “Look what I bought you!” She held up the skimpiest bubblegum pink dress I’ve ever seen. Alec turned to look and Jasper’s eyes about popped out of his head.

“You better be kidding. I am not wearing that!”

“Ha! Just the reaction I wanted. No, that’s my dress. This is yours.” She held up a black dress. Plunging neckline with side cutouts. It looked like it would stop just below my as s.

“Much better.” I approved.

“Where are you ladies going wearing those dresses?” Jasper asked. Maybe he is the play boy of the group.

“To the club. Actually, I changed my mind, I want to go tonight too.” Emmy popped her hip out and placed her hand on it like dare argue with me.

“Okay” I shrugged

“Really, just like that?”

“I didn’t get punished so yeah, lets go”

“Seriously?” Emmy looked shocked.

“Punished for what?” Jasper asked, his eyes narrowed

“She slapped her…”

“Emmy! Shut up!” I yelled.

“Tell me.” Jasper walked up to Emmy and grabbed her chin softly and made her look at him.

She was powerless at that moment. “Luna An n.”

“Holy s h it! You did not!” Jasper asked, shocked.

“She hit me first.” I muttered as I resumed working.

Alec placed his hand on my knee and squeezed it. His thumb rubbed my thigh. This was all behind the table so Jasper and Emmy couldn’t see.

“Pizza is here!” Jasper went outside to get it. Emmy went to the bathroom. As Jasper came back in, he looked weirdly at the bathroom door.

“What’s wrong?” I asked. Alec raised up and looked at Jasper.

“Dude, what is it?”

“How old is Emmy?”

“She is 18.”

He frowned and sat his pizza down. “Dude?” Alec said again.

“I think maybe she is my mate.” Alec and I looked at each other.

“Why do you say that?” I asked.

“Just the feeling I have. Alec, I think we are going out tonight.”

Alec looked at me and back at him. “Aw, f uc k.”

“Girl, I brought makeup so we can get ready here and not go back to the pack house.” Emmy popped her head out.

“Did you call Colt and tell him?” I asked.

“Yeah and they are meeting us since we have our bikes and that isn’t good with these dresses.”

“You bring me shoes?”

“I got it all, babe.”

I opened a mind-link to my dad. “We are going out tonight.”

“That’s what Colt said. Stay with him, be safe.”

“Thanks, dad.” I said and cut the link.

My mood improved dramatically. “How’s your pain level?”

“Are you at a stopping point?”

“Just about. Let me finish the part and we can call it.” I was working on his upper shoulders so my saddle stool was making his head between my thighs.







###Chapter 5

Chapter 0005 “I’m ready!” Emmy came out of the bathroom. She was a knockout in her dress. It has strings scrunching the sides and it was tightened enough her as s was almost sticking out. “Dam n.” Jasper’s mouth dropped. Alec and I looked at him and laughed. It felt so easy to be around them. “Eat your heart out.” Emmy quoted Grease. She had a confidence that made me jealous. “Alright. Let me clean it.” Spraying cool soapy water, I cleaned the tattoo. Alec got up and walked over to the mirror. We all followed him. “That looks f ucking awesome so far.” “Thank you, Jasper.” Alec didn’t say anything. “Let’s give that some time to heal.” “Can we do Wednesday?” Alec asked.

“Sure. You should be healed enough for me to continue.” I marked him down. “Here are care instructions and lotion to use on it.” “Angela will love rubbing that on for you.” Jasper joked. “Do NOT let her or anyone use fingernails. The charge is extra for me fixing your f uckups.” I said annoyed. “Noted.” Alec made his way out the door. “Alright girl. Lets get you cleaned up!” “I’m your doll.” I secretly love getting dolled up but I refused to tell her that. She made me sit as she unbraided my hair. An hour later, a whole can of dry shampoo and gel. My natural curl was framing my face beautifully. The dress fit me like a glove. It also stopped below my as s and my noveldrama

melons were looking amazing. 3 “Where are those guys?” Emmy wa’s annoyed. “I need to eat, anyway.” Sitting down, I unwrapped the supper dad brought me. I was a sandwich and chips. “Don’t mess up my makeup.” Emmy warned. I was half way done when the boys walked in. “Ready?” Colt was in all black. Jacob had a red silk shirt on with black pants and Ace had a white button up on. His was untucked with sleeves rolled. Kara was with them, wearing a satin blue dress that was a “Jacob, roll your sleeves.” His red shirt was tucked in but he still needed to roll them. The top three buttons were undone.. “Help me.” Jacob asked as he walked over to her. Ace rested his elbow on my counter as he looked down at my cleavage. “See something you like?” I teased. “Maybe” Colt was used to our flirting. I assumed he knew he occasionally made out but that’s all it was and he never brought it up. “I’m done eating. Lets go!” I didn’t need ID but I handed mine to Colt regardless. He put it in his wallet and Jacob took Emmy’s. Grabbing my keys, I locked the door and we piled into the SUV. There was too many of us to take a sports car. The bar we go to was technically owned by Colt and I but we used a different name so no one knew for sure. It was built in human territory so all the packs come. There is a rule about fighting so other than drunk guys, it was peaceful. The valet driver took the car from Colt as we got out. My red bottoms clacked on the sidewalk until we got to the carpet. “Sir Colt, Ms. Kris.” The bouncer was a pack member but we were in public so he addressed us as such.

The music was loud and banging as we entered. The front door opened up to a hallway. It was a balcony that over looked the dance floor. To the right was another set of stairs that lead to the VIP rooms. The left was a bar and stairs to go down. The bottom floor had a bar, dance floor and a recreational room with a pool table and a few arcade games. Emmy and I looked over the balcony as Colt and Jacob went to the bar. Ace stood beside us, looking like a da mn b*dy guard. “This place is busy!” A huge smile was plastered on my face. “I know! I need a drink first.” Emmy shouted. It was still early but it was already packed. We followed Ace up to the VIP rooms, where our drinks were waiting for us. Emmy gets a vodka cranberry. I get a Jack Daniels and Dr. pepper. The guys all got their whiskeys. Emmy and I stood at the balcony, watching the people below dance. I felt a pair of hands on my hips. “Ready to dance?” Ace whispered in our ears.







###Chapter 6

Chapter 0006 “Hell yeah!” Emmy yelled before grabbing Jacob’s hand. Colt and Kara followed us. His arm was around her shoulders. As soon as we hit the dance floor, Ace had his hands firmly on my hips, as he was pressed against me. “Dam n, woman. I want a bite.” Ace said in the mind-link. Resting my head against his chest, we grinded in harmony to the music. There was so much S**ual chemistry between us but neither of us wanted to go down that road. If we weren’t mates, it would end painfully. “Just a bite.” I teased back. The grinding music stopped and Single Ladies came on. The guys were out quickly, leaving us girls to sing and dance it out. Not sure what causes me to look up, but I did. On one side of the club was Ace. On the other, Alec. Both where staring at me. “Girl, what is going on with Alec? He has been staring at you since he got here!” Emmy asked. “Who’s Alec?” Kara asked. “Alpha Marc’s son.” Emmy nodded upward and Kara had no grace as she looked up and made it obvious

we were talking about him. “If I wasn’t with Colt, I’d hit that.” Kara said bluntly. She made me laugh. “Hi ladies. Anyone need a drink?” A human came up to us with his friends. I got a really bad vibe from them. “No, thanks. We are good.” “Ah come on!” He put his hands on my shoulders and tried to act S** y. Smacking his hands off me, “I said no thank you.” Nodding to the girls, I had them follow me off the dance floor and to the back door. noveldrama

1 “I sai-” the guy grabbed my shoulders and pushed me against the wall. “What is going on here?” A bouncer came up and asked. Not even thinking, I kneed him in the balls. “Please take the trash out.” “Yes, ma’am” he grabbed the two guys standing and pushed them towards the door. They were cussing “You ladies okay?” Jasper came out of no where. Honestly scaring the s hit out if me. His words said all of us but his eyes were locked on Emmy. “Perfect, now that your here.” She melted into his and his arms wrapped around her. His words came back to me. If she is his mate, that would be very interesting. “What’s going in here?” Colt and Alec walked up together. Both guys looked over at Jasper and Emmy in their own world. 1 “Um, not sure about them but I just took some trash out.” Kara sl*pped under Colt’s arm. “She basically made him infertile.” Kara laughed. I just rolled my eyes. “You good?” Alec asked. “Yeah, I need another drink.” “You guys are welcome to join us.” Colt said to Alec. “Thanks. Not sure I could drag him away, regardless.” Alec grabbed Jasper’s arm and pulled him away as I took Emmy’s arm and we lead the way.. Ace and Jacob were nowhere to be found. “What do you guys want to drink?” “Whiskey on the rocks.” Alec said for the both. Emmy and Jasper sat opposite from me. Kara and Colt sat on the far back of the U shaped booth and I was on the end with Alec on my right. “So, what happened?” Colt pressed.

“They wouldn’t take no for an answer.” I shrugged. Our drinks arrived quickly. Grabbing mine I sipped half if it. “There you guys are. We went looking for you all.” Ace sl*pped in on me left and Jacob had a girl he moved in after Ace. I was completely sandwiched between Ace and Alec. “This is Candy.” Jacob announced. No one knew really what to say. Candy was a strippers name. She was dressed as such. 3 “How did you guys find us?” I asked Alec. “Right place, right time.” “Did something happen?” Ace asked. “Not really. Just took some trash out.” “Dam n.” Ace leaned back and sipped in his drink. “EMMY!” I yelled. “What?” She jumped, making her attention come back to the table. 15 BONUS








###Chapter 7

Chapter 0007 “What is Emmy short for?” Jasper asked “Emily.” “What a beautiful name.” Jasper ran his finger down her cheek. I leaned over to Alec, “is he always like this?” “No, he is being weird.” “Do you think they are mates?” “We will find out here soon.” Alec showed me his watch. Fifteen minutes. “Lets go dance!” Candy yelled. Jacob got up and let her drag him away. “Ace!” He gave me a look and I shook my head no. Frowning, he got up and went after them. “Don’t want to dance?” Colt asked me. “I do but I want to see what happens.” I said nodding towards them. “Me too!” Kara was giddy with excitement. “What if we are mates? We will know soon!” noveldrama

Alec and I both felt Colt’s discomfort. He pulled at his collar. Alec leaned in. “Does he not want her as a mate?” “She isn’t exactly Luna material.” Alec nodded. “Miss Kris. I’m so sorry to bother you but we have a situation.” A bartender came up to me, looking nervous. “What’s wrong?” “It’s the tap. We can’t figure it out.” “Da mn. Okay. Give me a minute and I’ll be right there.” I said. She sighed in relief and walked off. “Is there anything you don’t do?” Alec asked. “Kill a mockingbird” “Are you ever serious?” He frowned at me. “Occasionally.” Taking the cherry out if my drink, I seductively put it between my teeth and pulled the A primal growl brought us out of our thoughts as Jasper looked at Emmy. “Mate.”

“Mate.” She whispered as they finally k*ssed. The tension was high but they managed to hold off. “Okay then.” I said. I started scooted out of the booth. “Where are you going?” Colt asked. “Fixing the bar?” I said confused. “I’ll go with you.” Colt sighed. “No! I want to dance!” Kara whined. Colt’s face looked pis sed. “I’ll go with her. You have my word, I’ll protect her.” Alec said, easing the tension. “I don’t need to be saved.” I muttered as I walked away angrily. “Which kind of saving are you referring to?” Alec whispered in my ear. His se xy voice made my panties wet. “All kinds.” “It seems to me you could use at least one kind or does my nose lie to me?” The tw inkle in his eye caught me off guard as his eyes went to my l*ps. “1-” I couldnt form a sentence as my b*dy moved closer to his. “Alec! There you are!” I heard her voice from behind him. Quickly taking a step back, I gathered myself as Angela came around the bar. It was the perfect moment for me to sl*p behind it as she jumped on him. His eyes found mine as she k*ssed his l*ps. Not sure why it stung so much but it did. Taking a deep breath, I focused on the issue. “Here. We put a new keg on and now its not working.” Walking to the back, I noticed they didn’t reset it. “You have to turn the machine off. H ook it up and then reset it.” I showed her how to do it before waling back to the front and testing it. “Oh jeez. Thank you!” She said.

“Of course!” Truthfully, I was ready to go home but I wouldn’t do that to Emmy. I’ll leave when she is ready to. Alec







###Chapter 8

Chapter 0008 “No, I am going to take her to her brother. You are going to go be with your friends.” “What? You’re choosing her over me?” Angela looked at me like she was disgusted. “I’m not choosing anyone. I am doing what I told her brother I would do. This is why we will never be a couple.” I saw the hurt flash before her eyes before she ran off crying. “Am I the drama?” I teased. “You can go after her. I’m not a job.” I said more serious. Alec grabbed my hand and pulled me into another room. It was a conference room but didn’t get used often. He pinned me against the wall and pressed his b*dy against mine. “Tell me you don’t want this. Tell me to stop.” Alec’s hand was around my neck, pulling my hair so I was looking up at him. His other hand was on my chin as his thumb opened my mouth.

I couldn’t talk as my need filled his senses. His eyes went black as my tongue licked his thumb. With a deep growl, he l*ps pressed hard against mine. Holding me close to him, he k*ssed me hard. It was only after a few minutes did he allow me to breath again. “I shouldn’t have done that.” He took a few steps back as rejection went through me. “Then forget it happened!” I yelled. Before he could stop me, I ran out of the room and straight to the bathroom. Going into a stall, I sat down to pee. It took a few minutes to collect myself. It wasn’t until I heard foot steps and the bathroom door lock, did my 6th sense of danger rise my hair. “Colt, girls bathroom. Help me.” I said quickly as my stall door shook. “Hold on, sis.” Colt said angrily. “Come out, bi tch.” It was Angela and two other girls. Standing up and flushing the toilet, I walked out. “What do you ladies want?” “I want you to leave Alec alone. He is mine!” She pushed her finger on my chest. “Either take a step back or I break your finger.” It was three against one. I would be able to get one solid hit in before the rest joined in. She took a step forward, into me. noveldrama

Fine by me. Pulling my fist back. I got one punch to her teeth before the other two tried to grab me. I knew I broke at least one tooth before I got punched in the ribs. Throwing an elbow, I got another girl in the nose, breaking it. I took two more punches to the ribs before I grabbed a head and smashed it against the sink. The door flew off its hinges as Colt and Alec stormed in. Alec grabbed two by the neck and shoved them against the hall. Colt took Angela and choked her as I gathered my bearings. “What the f uck is going in here!” Alec roared. He looked down right scary as the girls shook in fear. 1 “You came to my club to pick a fight with my sister?” Colt said dangerously calm. Alec came over to me and looked at me. I was still on the ground, trying to catch my breath. He turned my face to him. Ripping my face out of his hand, I sta ggered to stand. It took me a second and once Emmy came over, she helped me. “Kristen?” Colt’s voice caused me to look up. I was f ucking pis sed. I had a few broken rips but was fine otherwise. Angela was still conscious but barely. After gaining my balance, I walked up to Angela. Grabbing her finger, I snapped it in half. “We will settle this in the ring. I hereby challenge you.” The words were out of my mouth when Angela looked downright scared. All she could do was flare her arms. “Jasper. Bring the around.” Alec demanded. “Colt, Kris. My apologies for my pack members. Their punishment is your choice and I hope this doesn’t color the partnership moving forward.” He was referring to the fact Emmy and Jasper were mates.







###Chapter 9

Chapter 0009 Jasper wasn’t the same man I saw earlier. He made me want to hide with his demeanor. He walked out of the bathroom. “Come to Alpha Brians office tomorrow with Alpha Marc. We will settle details then.” Colt answered. “We will be there.” Alec.looked at Angela. “Your cells or mine?” “Mine.” I answered for Colt. Alec looked at me for a second but nodded. “Nnoo!” She cried. Jasper appeared and grabbed the two girls and drug them to his car, “I got the SUV.” Jacob came out the corner. “Ace.” Colt said and nodded towards me. Examining me, he walked up to me gently and picked me up bridal style. I had to bite his shoulder to keep from crying out. He stood still to let me get adjusted and the pain to settle. After a second, my bite released and I laid my head down on his chest.

“Bit ch.” I muttered as Ace carried me out to the SUV. “Um, Ice?” Emmy was looking nervously between us and Jasper. Lifting my head up, “It’s okay. You go and come back with them for the meeting.” “Are you okay?” She looked like she was going to cry. “I’ve had much worse.” I gave her a weak smile. She k*ssed my cheek before going to Jasper. We all left and got into our vehicle. Ace kept me on his lap as we made our way. Jacob kept a firm grip on Angela. When we got home, he took her straight to the cells. Ace took me to the hospital. The doctor and my dad were waiting for us. “Colt. What happened?” Dad demanded as the doctor got an x-ray. “She got jumped by three girls. One is in our cells. Alpha Marc will be here to discuss punishment. I should add that Kris challenged the one girl to a fight. Also, Emmy is mated to their future Beta Jasper.” “This is messy.” Dad

“Two broken ribs but okay otherwise.” Dr. Hett announced. “Don’t need adjusted, should heal in a day or two.” “Thanks, doc.” Colt said. Ace picked me back up and we headed to the pack house. I was just next door. 1/2 He walked me up to my room and set me down. “Thanks. I got it from here.” I said as I made my way inside. He didn’t say anything, just gave me a look I couldn’t read and walked away. Colt had placed my phone and ID on my night stand so all I needed to do was strip and curl into bed. Which is what I did. I was almost asleep when my phone vibrated. It was a text. Unknown: it’s Alec. I’m sorry about tonight. Me: which part exactly? (I saved his number.) Alec: it all. I don’t regret the k*ss but I shouldn’t have done it. Me: oh? Alec: couldn’t help myself. You looked too good. Me: how many girls have you said that to? It took so long for him to respond that I fell asleep. Waking up the next morning, I looked at my phone. 1 unread message. Clicking it. Alec: too many but you are the first one I actually cared that I hurt. Ignoring his message, I got up and showered. It took me a little longer but I got it done. It was Saturday. and I had a day at the parlor so grabbing comfy clothes was a must. I tried doing my hair but I couldn’t raise my arms. S hit. Maybe Emmy can do it when she gets here. Depending what her plans are. I could use her help today. “Sis, they’re here.” Colt mind-linked me. “Coming.” Standing up, I made my way down to my dad’s office. The door was open and to my displeasure, An n was on her desk working.

“How are you feeling?” Dad asked as I came in. 1 “Pi ssed off.” “Good.” Dad nodded. An n didn’t say anything, just shook her head. I sat down on a chair across from him. We didn’t have to wait long before we heard footsteps.noveldrama







###Chapter 10

Chapter 0010 “Alpha Brian.” Alpha Marc said as he walked in. I tried to stand but he put a hand on my shoulder. “Dont try to get up. How are you feeling?” “She’s fine.” An n spoke for me. Everyone looked over, confused as to why she was answering. The three girls walked in with Alec, Jasper and Emmy. Emmy came right over to me. “How are you?” “Nothing I havent had before. Can you braid my hair?” “Sure.” Emmy stood up and started working. I looked at the other girls. Broken nose, missing teeth and black eyes. “Looks like three against one didn’t serve you right.” Dad mocked them. “I would like to start by apologizing for their behavior. They will be punished as you see fit.” “My daughter has issued a challenged to that one.” Dad said, firmly. “Stu pid girl!” An n muttered. “Perhaps you should see the gardening is getting done?” Dad was pushing An n out of the room. “The sooner you see she is just trash, the faster we get rid of her!” An n yelled as she left. I was so used to

it that I didnt even flinch. Alec and Marc were looking at me with pity. I could almost read his mind. “No wonder you hit her.” “Anyway. Let’s schedule that for next saturday?” Alpha Marc asked. “Perfect.” I said looking at her. She looked scared but she full of anger. “Then there is the matter of this young lady being mated to our future Beta.” “Aw yes. Miss Emily Rose Willis. The daughter of out top warriors. She will be missed.” “Can we excuse the kids and let us talk?” Alpha Marc asked. “Certainly.” We all stood and made our way to the lobby. “What are your plans?” I asked Emmy as Jasper and Colt were taking the girls to the cells to wait to be

punished. “Don’t believe I have any. Maybe moving my stuff.” +15 BONUS “Can you help me in the shop today? I can’t raise my arms.” “Of course I can.” She looked at Alec for confirmation. He shook his head no. “You need to move your stuff and do all the official stuff. I will come with you and help you out.” Emmys face lit up.”that’s so nice of you.” My eyes narrowed. “Yeah, nice is a word to use or did your dad put you on me to make sure this doesn’t turn into a bigger situation?” When he didn’t answer, I knew mine. “That’s what I thought. I don’t need your help.” Standing up, I started making my way to my car. “Ice!” Emmy called out. “Love you!” I said so she knew I wasn’t mad at her. “Nope! My car, princess.” 1 “Princess?” Alec held the door to his st upid sports car. I bet it attracted alot of girls. “Why do they call you Ice?” 1 “Because my heart is made of Ice.” It was a learned skill. “Colt, the hot. Social, chick magnet, warm guy. Me, ice. The cold hearted sister that has a reputation of taking no s hit.” “So, I’ve heard.” “Yup, that’s why nothing you can do to me will hurt my feelings. So, whatever this is. Don’t worry about it. You don’t owe me anything. We aren’t seeking war and you can go back to doing whatever you want to do with who ever you want.”

We pulled up to my shop. It took me a second to unlock the door and go inside. Cleaning the bathroom and picking up the trash was rough but I managed. Going to the sterilizer, I got put my gun and instruments that I’d need and made piles. The ink was on shelves above my head. Sighing, “Alec?” “Yes, princess?” He came into the room with his arms crossed.noveldrama








###Chapter 11

Chapter 0011 “I need the ink.” “What colors?” He asked. “Each pile gets a black. The second one gets three.” Alec did as I asked. “The fourth is a water color tattoo so I need one pink, purple, blue, green and yellow. This one is red and orange.” “Four tattoos today?” Alex asked. “Yeah, they are all big tattoos and not much pain tolerance.” “Mine is itching like crazy.” “Turn around and lift your shirt up.” I said rolling my eyes. Grabbing the numbing lotion, I put it on his back. He even keeled for me but I caught him looking at me in the mirror. 1 “What?” “Nothing.” Not wanting to push it more, I finished up, threw the glove away and went over to my desk. Stencils were ready and I had 15 minutes to spare so I pulled out my sketch book. Alec walked over and looked at my phoenix. “That looks amazing.” “Thanks.” He took the book and fl*pped through it. While he looked, I remembered I needed to send spelling bee words. Sending the link to the words I had picked out was easy enough.

The evening pasted slow with Alec looking over me and the guys I was tattooing not having a pain tolerance. I just needed one more hour to finish and he had to schedule for another day. I swear, guys are huge babies when it comes to pain. 5 Alec looked bored in the corner of the room. He watched me work for the most part or texted on his phone. Part of me wanted to know who he was texting but it was also none of my business. After the last guy left, it was nice to lock the door and take a deep breath. Finally, all day and I was ready for bed. noveldrama

“Done?” Alec asked as he watched me put gloves on and start to clean up. +15 BONUS “Yeah, just need to clean up and balance my books.” Throwing away the sharps in an approve container, everything else went in the trash. The reusable items went into the sterilizer. Then just had to disinfect it all. Alec just watched me work. Occasionally I flinched but it wasn’t anything I needed help on. “Does Luna A nn hit you?” Alec asked me randomly. My whole b*dy froze. S hit. He probably already knew the answer but wanted to hear me say it. “Doesn’t matter. I won’t be around much longer.” “What do you mean?” “Once I’m 18, I’m leaving and traveling until Colt takes over. Then I’ll come back.” “Why doesn’t Colt stop her or your dad?” “Colt has done more for me than anyone else. He has been there and does what he can. It’s not like he can be around me 24/7 plus it’s not like I can’t handle a bruise or a split l*p.” I sighed as I sat in my chair to finish my book work. Alec came over and stood at my desk. “Where do you want to go?” Glancing at him, I was taken aback. “Anywhere, everywhere. Anywhere that isn’t here.” “How will you keep tattooing?” “Suppose I’ll have to put that on hold.” “What about a mate?” “You sure have a lot of questions.” I muttered, tired of the third degree. “Just curious” “Well, when I find him, I’ll ask him.” Knock! Knock! Looking over, Colt was standing at the door. Alec went over and opening it.

“Alec.” Colt said as he walked in. “Colt.” They didn’t measure each others di cks but they were close. “What’s up bro?” “Just checking in on you.” He came over and looked at what I was working on. 1 Doing good. Its going to be a good month.” “Good, that will make it easier for you.” “Easier for her?” Alec asked confused. “For when I start traveling. If I am cut off, I have my own money to live off of.” I answered not really carrying if he knew. You’re okay with her leaving?” Alec asked Colt. “F uck no but I rather her not get abused anymore either.”







###Chapter 12

Chapter 0012 “Not sure why I have to wait till I’m 18. I’m smarter than everyone.” I said stubbornly. Colt smiled at me. “Although I agree with you, we made a deal.” “Whatever.” “Besides, dad asked what we wanted to do for our 18th birthday. I think he wants to have a massive party.” Colt folded his arms. “Do I have to go to it?” It sounded like a terrible idea. “You do and you have to wear a dress.” “Not much of a birthday party for me, then.” “What do you want to do for your birthday?” Alec asked. “Hmm.” I had to think about it. “Maybe go on a hike up a mountain or lay on the beach or even a pool. Something small and intimate.” “Why not tell your dad that is what you want?” Alec asked. “It is expected we find our mate as soon as we turn 18. To start a full training on whatever job we are doing. In Colts case, they need to train a Luna.” I frowned. “I think dad expects you to be mated to Ace so your are a beta female.” Colt frowned.

“Which is a step down plus I already do more work the An n does in a year.” “A big party increases our chances of finding a mate.” Colt continued. “What will a mate do for me? Even if it was Ace, that just means I am stuck here for the rest of my life.” “But once I take over, no one will ever lay a hand on you again.” Colt promised. “Sorry, I guess this is family drama you don’t care about. Poor alpha female whining about being disciplined.” “Every pack has family drama. I’m not going to tell anyone yours.” Alec promised. “Have you found your mate?” Colt asked Alec. “Nope. Not in a hurry.” Alec shrugged. “That’s right. The chick that attacked Kris is your girl.” Colt got annoyed,

“Was, after the disrespect she showed in the pizza parlor, I dumped her.” He acted like it was no big deal. “I’m hungry and tired. You boys can stay here and talk but I want food.” “! promised Kara I would take her out. I just wanted to come here and check on you.” Colt frowned. “Enjoy your date. I’ll grab my car and get something.” Colt looked at his watch. “I have time to run you home…” “I got it dude. I had already planned on it.” Alec spoke up. “Alright.” Colt looked at me. “Text me when you get home.” “Yes, sir.” Rolling my eyes, I said it extremely sarcastic. Colt smiled, k*ssed my forehead and walked out. “When you are ready, we can go.” Alec looked at his watch too. “If I’m keeping you, I can walk.” “Nope, I’m good.” After finishing a few entries, I was ready to go. “Ready.” “Good, let’s go.” Alec all but pushed me out the door. I guess he was in a hurry too. “What’s the rush? I thought you didn’t have plans?” “I just made some.” Alec smiled as he started the engine. Rolling the window down, I let the wind flow in my face as he raced down the road. It wasn’t until he missed the turn that I looked at him. “Um, you missed the turn!” “No I didn’t.” “Yes.. You did. You can’t go to my pack house this way.” “We aren’t going to your pack house.” “But your plans…?” I was so confused. “My plans are with you.” “With me? Why?” “Do you have a curfew?” Alec smirked at me. “Well, no.” noveldrama

“What’s wrong? Do I make you nervous?” “S hit, no you don’t.” Deciding I wasn’t going to get answers, I turned my attention back to the window. The wind was warm as it hit my face. The starts were shinning brightly, illuminating the world around me. It really was a perfect night. 2 When Alex turned, I realized his plans. “Really?” I sounded way too excited for this. “Never come here?”







###Chapter 13

Chapter 0013 “Nope.” It was a drive in movie. You could order food and watch a movie. Tonight, Twister was playing. “I hope you like cheeseburgers.” Alec smiled at my reaction. “I do.” Alec found a parking space towards the back of the lot. We got out and climbed on the hood of his car. Alec pulled out a blanket so we didn’t scratch the paint. “I assume you come here often with girls.” “You would be the first. This is usually something I do by myself.” “Then why did you bring me?” I was surprised by his response. “I wanted to watch a movie.” Alec shrugged. Our food came and the movie started. I loved this moving. My cheeseburger was perfect and juicy. Alex had to give me a napkin as the juice ran down my chin. “Attractive.” He teased. “I try.” Laughing so I cleaned it off. “Can I ask you a question?”

“Sure.” I was only half listening to him as I was watching the movie. “What did you mean when you said you were smarter than everyone?” “Just that. I am.” “What’s your IQ?” “That is reserved for my mate to know.” I laughed. “I mean, it’s not a secret but it is.” “Hmm.” “Just put it this way, I could have s kipped high school all together and went to college.” I already said too much. “Why are you so interested in me for?” “I’m not really, just making conversation..” “My life isn’t as interesting as you think. This is what you get.” I shrugged. Maybe someone will care enough to dig deep and force me to answer questions. “Looks like it.” Alec gave me a sad smile. noveldrama

+15 BONUS “Besides, if Angela was your type, I am the exact opposite so we can we fiends but I don’t think I’m girly enough for you.” “I never said I was interested in you that way.” “No, you never did, did you.” Fine, want to play it that way… “I guess the k*ss at the club was in the heat of the moment.” “Something like that.” Alec kept his eyes on the movie. I didn’t feel like pushing so we watched the movie in silence. There was this weird chemistry between us. You could call it S**ual or maybe it was because I didn’t grow up with him. Alec had that silent guy aura and was se xy as hell. That k*ss we shared was intense. It was all I could do to focus on the movie and not get aroused. “I love that movie.” Alec said sliding off the hood. He held out his hands to help me down. I appreciate it as my rips were still hurting. 3 “I do too. Its a classic.” Getting into the car, Alec put the blanket away. His phone buzzed, making him check it before he got in. “Everything okay?” I asked as he sl*pped in. His mood had changed. “Yes” He said almost short. Flooring it, he peeled out of the parking lot. My mouth opened and closed a few times before I just sat back and didn’t speak. We got to my packhouse in record time. Alec leaned across me and opened the door but he didn’t get out. “Oh, um… Thanks for supper and the movie.” I said to him before I got out. “Welcome.” He was mad at something. Confused, I got out and before my door was shut, he got on the gas and left quickly. That was weird. It wasn’t really late but no one was up, making it easy for me to get to bed.

“Ice?” My b*dy started shaking. “The f u ck?” Peaking out from one eye lid, I saw Emmy sitting on my bed. “I came to spend the day with you.” “What about your mate?” “I’ll meet up with him tonight. Alec was in a pi ssy mood when he got home last night and that carried over “When did he get home?” I asked.








###Chapter 14

Chapter 0014 “Oh, I don’t know. Around 11:30ish?” Emmy tried to remember, that wasn’t far off from when he dropped me off. “Why?” “No reason, just curious why he was so pis s y.” “Who knows.” “What do you want to do today?” I asked as I yawned and sat up. “Any tattoos today?” Emmy asked. “This afternoon I do. Nothing this morning.” “Good, lets go shopping for a dress tonight and a dress for your birthday party!” Emmy looked way too excited. 1 “Oh joy. Can’t wait!” I said sarcastically. Getting out of bed, I tested my range of motion. It was better but still tender. My phone dinged so I grabbed it as I made my way to the bathroom. Looking at it, I had two messages. Ace: hey, how are you feeling today? Alec: sorry about last night. Hmm, not ready to dive into that. Instead, my hair needed attention. My energy level was low so putting it in a messy bun and grabbed joggers and a crop top, I was ready to go. “Very attractive.” Emmy said as she looked me up and down.

“I tired” grabbing my purse, we headed out. 1 “I’m so excited!” Emmy squealed. As we got to the lobby, Colt, the gang and dad were there. I was excited to see then but then An n stepped out from the kitchen. (1 noveldrama

“Where do you think you are going?” An n spit out. “Shopping for a birthday dress.” I answered honestly. “There has been an increase of rogue attacks. Maybe a guy should go with you girls.” Dad said looking concerned. “They will be fine. She needs something nice to wear.” A nn gave me a look as she assessed my outfit. “Maybe I can go for a bit?” Colt suggested. “We don’t need protection.” I said annoyed. “I have the same training as them.” “Emily…” An n said her name in a disgusted tone, “might. Her now pack will be upset if she gets hurt under our watch.” I really hated her. “She’s not wrong. Alpha Marc did the right thing about Angela.” Colt agreed to my dismay. “Ace will go with them.” Dad said finally My heart sank. I was wanting some space. “Sure.” Ace was leaning against the door frame. His eyes instantly went to mine as he spoke. “Let’s go.” Emmy said as she grabbed my arm and pulled me out the door. “I’m driving.” Ace said as he got into his own sports car. Emmy automatically got in the back, leaving me the front seat. Awesome… “To the mall!” Ace nodded as he stepped on the peddle. Emmy’s phone rang. As she talked on the phone, it left us alone. “You didn’t answer my text.” Ace said in the mind-link. “Sorry, Emmy was forcing me to get out of bed. I’m feeling okay. Still sore but not bad.” “You been avoiding me.” It was a statement, not a question. “You’re putting too much thought into it.” I had to resist the urge to bit my fingernails 1 “Stop lying. You only started acting this way after Alec showed up. Is there something going on there?”

He sounded annoyed. “No! Yes, no. Its not Alec it’s the fact I will be 18 soon and the reality is just sinking it. We may not be mates and if we aren’t, what happens if he thinks there is anything romantic between us.” “How do you feel about me?” Ace asked in a tone I couldn’t read. “I mean… Your a great friend. We had an agreement, it was only make out sessions and that’s it. No feelings and if one of us caught feelings, we were suppose to end it. Do you have feelings?” I’m not sure I wanted to hear what I already knew. “You dam n well know I do.” He is full on anger now. Thankfully Emmy got off the phone and started asking me questions. “What kind of dress do you want?” +15 BONUS “This is a black tie event. Well, that is until 11 when the party starts!” I looked back and smiled at her. “Exactly. I want an all black number with sparkle.” Emmy showed a sweetheart or just strapless dress with her fingers. “I’m not sure I have a preference. Just something I can dance in.” “Well, it better now be too trashy or Luna An n will have a fit.” Emmy rolled her eyes. “So do it!” “Ha! I was actually thinking of showing up in a scarlet red dress. Just to stand out and make a statement.” Emmys eyes got wide. “That would make a statement.” We had just pulled into the parking lot. “Or maybe a white dress?” “No, save that for your Luna Ceremony.” “Luna ceremony? Did you forget Colt is older and taking the spot?” We got out of the car and started walking in. Ace stayed behind us. “I still think you will be mated to an alpha. Preferably Alec so we can still live in the same pack!”, “I highly doubt I am mated to him. No, my luck I will be stuck in this pack for the rest of my life.” Ace held the door open for us as we walked in. “I’m sure your mate will want to travel!” Emmy tried to back peddle. My eyes glanced over at Ace who had a frown on. If I was mated to him, he couldn’t travel

with me but he also told me he wouldn’t keep me here if I was. Though, he wouldn’t let An n hit me anymore. 1







###Chapter 15

Chapter 0015 “Let’s go in there!” Emmy squealed as she dragged me into the first store. It was Varanasi. We had each picked out three dresses. All of Emmys were exactly like she talked about. Mine were all very different styles. The first one was a dark green thin strapped dress with a deep V. It was tight around my waist and then went straight down. The slit came up to my mid-thigh. Walking out of the dressing room, I got up and stood in front of the mirrors. “That looks good.” Ace said out loud. “It doesn’t do much for my figure but I can dance in it” “I don’t like that for you.” Emmy scrunched up her nose. “Oh good. I wasnt feeling it.” Now, Emmy was rocking a sweetheart strapless dress. It was a mermaid style but she didnt have the hips to fill it appropriately. “Not feeling that one either.” “Yeah, doesn’t do much for me.” Emmy agreed. We went back into the dressing rooms. My next one was all black with random cut outs. It had thicker straps that crossed under my boobs. This caused them to really lift and rise. The does he game was strong. The cross went around to the back, crossed and came back to the front. The cut outs were under my chest, my sides, and most of my back. The skirt and more formed, showing off my curves perfectly. The cross in the back was mid back so the part of the skirt that was crunched together sat right about my as s crac k. There was a slit that came up to my upper thigh. Enough that I wouldn’t be able to wear panties. I felt beautiful and s exy. Defiantly not a dress An n would approve of.

Emmy walked out the same time. Her dress was a swoop neck but two very pointed edges above each breast. It was a corset style black dress. The skirt had the front lifted up and scrunched so it looked more like a party dress for salsa dancing. “Holy f uck. Even if you don’t wear that to your party, you are buying that dress.” Emmy stopped in her tracks.

“Da mn.” Ace muttered before he started fidgeting in his seat. “I really like that dress on you!” I told Emmy. “Me too. It’s flattering and I can dance.” Looking at myself in the mirror, I tried to picture myself all dolled up. Curly hair that was in a low bun with a few lose ends. Maybe even red l*ps and shoes “Okay, we got one more.” Emmy said excitedly. Walking back to the fitting room, I had one more I was anxious to try on. I’ll admit I loved this black one more than I thought I would. Emmy was right. I’m buying it regardless. This next one was Scarlett red. Just like I wanted. It was a corset style that really pushed the girls up and sucked in my waist. However, it was lace and all see through. The breast were lined black but you could see my stomach until the skirt started. The slit was wide as the lace lined the silk shirt. Walking out, Emmy had beat me. She looked stunning in a silk dress. It wasn’t fully firm fitted and reminded me of more like a lingerie dress. With the tiniest straps, she looked perfect. “Get some boob tape and that’s your dress.” “I know! I didn’t think I wanted straps and honestly, I didn’t realize they even had them.” Walking up next to her, she finally realized what I was wearing. “Hot dam n!” “I know! It’s se xy in its own way.” “They are both S** y. Just a different kind of se xy! I knew what she meant but I wasn’t sure which kind I wanted. “Screw it. I’ll get both and decide that day.” Emmy jumped up and down with excitement. “Can we leave now?” Ace grumbled. “Why are you so moody?” Emmy asked him as she partially ignored him. “Nothing.” My heart ached as I knew why he was grumpy. noveldrama

“Hangry?” She joked. “I actually am. Let’s grab a bite and head out. I got work to do.” “We need to head home. We can grab something and take it with us.” “It’s fine, I need to get to the salon anyway.” Maybe the sooner we are apart the less grumpy he will be. “Fine.” Emmy sigh. “A salad sounds good.” “That it does. Call in an order at Pattys and I’ll run in and get it “looking back at Emmy, her eyes got wide. and nodded in approval. I tuned her out as she ordered. “Is this seriously going to be your mood?” “What did you expect?” “We should have never even started. I’m sorry.” My heart sank thinking about the pain I caused him. I didn’t want to admit that I hoped he wasn’t my mate so I wouldn’t be stuck here. However, I had a feeling The car pulled into Pattys. Jumping out before Ace could stop me, I was able to rush inside. The hot humid air assaulted me, making my skin sweat. “Table for one?” The hostess asked “I actually have a order to go” “Perfect, the name?” “Oh, um probably under Emmy” “Two salads?” “That would be it!” I sighed in relief.







###Chapter 16

Chapter 0016 As soon as I sl*pped back in the car, I could tell Ace was even more pi ssed off. “What’s wrong?” “It’s Saturday! Club day! That is, if you feel up to it. “Emmy looked at me uncertainty. 1 “Let’s see how the evening goes.” “You can’t possibly be thinking about going tonight?” Ace was starting to get on my nerves. “I’ve gone dancing with a broken foot. How is a few ribs worse than that?” He didn’t respond but sped the whole way home. Emmy looked back and forth between us but kept her mouth shut. As soon as we pulled into the packhouse, Ace jumped out and took off. Thankfully, Emmy grabbed my dresses and we went up to my room. “What is with Ace?” “Apparently he caught feelings for me and is struggling with the idea we may not be mates. He wants me to be hanging off him and to chose him regardless.” “He said that?” Emmys mouth dropped. “Not in so many words but yeah. He told me he has feelings. We agreed we would stop if someone had feelings but he never told me.” Opening my salad, I dug in.

“We all see it. How did you not?” “Maybe I turned a blind eye. It was something I looked forward to in order to get over An n. Honestly, I used him for a distraction and that’s f ucked up. My only defense is he knew that going into it. It was only make out sessions. Nothing more.” Guilt flooded me. “What’s with Alec?” Emmy asked rising her eye brows up at me. “Nothing. He’s a play boy and only has training for alpha on the brain.” I didn’t feel like telling her about the k*ss. “Alec or Ace?” She held up both hands like I 1 was suppose to pick one. “Six more days and the Moon Goddess will pick for me.”

“Girl, Friday is your big birthday bash. Saturday is your fight. Then the following Saturday is prom.” “Whichever dress I don’t wear to my birthday, I’ll wear to prom.” “I think you should wear the red. Make a f u cking statement.” “An n will love that…” I said as I rolled my eyes. I had finished eating my salad and waited for Emmy to be done. “I’m done. We need to head out?” “That we do. I want to ride.” I needed the wind in my hair. “Can you ride?” “We will find out.” Emmy jumped up, I took my time. My mood was lightening up… That was until we entered the foyer. An n was yelling at some poor maid. From what I gathered, she missed the vacuuming. SLAP! A nn smacked the girl, causing her to fall to the ground. “An n!” I couldn’t help myself. “Colt, get to the foyer. An n struck the maid.” I mind-linked him. “Coming” he replied “Oh look, it’s the pathetic daughter. Have you done your chores yet?” A nn rounded in me. “Leave her alone, An n.” Colt, Jacob and Jasper busted in the front doors. His voice was dangerous as he walked up and stood in front if me. Jasper grabbed Emmy and pulled her away as Jacob grabbed me. “This doesn’t concern you. This brat needs to be taught to not interrupt what doesn’t concern her.” An n looked at me as spit flew out of her mouth. “You know you are not allowed to hit the staff.” Colt stated in a dangerously calm voice. “Just wait, he won’t be around forever.” An n muttered as she walked off. “Is she always this way?” Jasper didnt let up on his grip he had in Emmy. “Only towards me. I look too much like our mother.” Jacob let me go and took a few steps back. “Where are you ladies going?” Jacob asked. “I got a few tattoos booked. Emmy was going to help me since reaching above my head is still sore.” I

said looking at Jasper. He nodded. “That’s okay. We are finishing up a few things here.” “I want to go to the club tonight.” Emmy looked up at Jasper and batted her eyes.noveldrama








Chapter 17
Chapter 0017 Jasper looked at Colt. “I’ll talk to Alec and let you know. Rogues are getting restless and after last night…” “We dont have to dance… Just sit and have a few drinks. Relax and get away from here…” Emmy motioned towards the door An n walked out of. She made it sound like I needed to get away. What she didn’t know, was I was going to be sneaking out regardless. Even if we didn’t go, I was going to go for a midnight run. It really didn’t matter to me one way or another. “I’ll talk to Alec.” Jasper repeated. “You girls need a ride?” Colt asked. “I want to ride.” I told him. Colt frowned but didnt say anything. “Thank you.” Going up to him, I gave him a hug. “Any and every time.” He muttered. “Wear a helmet. I’ll be by to visit.” Jasper said to Emmy before k*ssing her goodbye.

“I will! Thanks for the concern!” I yelled a Jasper before laughing. I walked out without even looking at his reaction. Emmy came running after me. “You know I love you!” Emmy wrapped her arm through mine as we made our way to the garage. “I’m a very lovable person.” Some may not agree but I thought so. “Here.” Emmy put my helmet on me before I got on my bike. After she did the same, we started our engines and took off. At first, my ribs protested but at this point, I welcomed the pain. It felt so nice to have the wind in my hair that I almost missed my turn. “You feeling okay?” Emmy asked as we pulled in our parking spots. “I could use a five hour ride.” There was sarcasm in my voice but I wasn’t joking. “That would be fun!” noveldrama

Unlocking the door, we walked in. I loved this smell. It was the smell of freedom, independence and happiness. “I’ll get the ink for you.” Emmy called out. “Thanks!” Grabbing the rest of the stuff, I was ready to go with thirty minutes to spare. “Why can’t anyone show up early?” +15 BONUS “It’s okay. I have a few things to do. Actually, I have a list of things I am going to have you do while I work.” “Oh?” Emmy wasn’t my assistant but occasionally I forced her to be. “Yup. Easy stuff. Just call these people and verify everything is going according to schedule. Email these people with the correct information and balance the checkbook for prom. Here are the last of the feceipts.” “Girl…” “Please?” I fluttered my eyes at her. “I will allow you to….” “Oooh, just give me an IOU. I want to hold out and cash it in when I need to.” S hit. “Fine. I’m going to regret this.” My first client came in so I got to work on him as Emmy got to work on the emails. My first client had a low pain tolerance so its taken multiple small sessions to finish this. Today was the last one and I was so excited to finish this one. He wanted one of my drawings. It was of a sword with a pair of eyes from a wolf reflecting with blood dripping off it. The shading was very delicate work but it was looking amazing. “Let me clean it and then you can look at it.” Smiling, I was really happy with the results. Spraying it, I was able to gentle wipe it clean. “Alright. I’m going to grab my camera. You can go look.” 1 Alec and Jasper walked in. “What’s up, beautiful?” Jasper leaned on the counter at Emmy. She immediately blushed which made me roll my eyes. Grabbing my camera, I went to take the picture. “That looks good.” Alec came over and looked at my tattoo. “Thanks. Kris is a great artist.”

“Thanks, Matt. You know what to do. We are all finished.” Looking at my picture, I was satisfied. “Bye!” Matt walked out of my store. “What do I owe this pleasure?” I sighed and looked at Alec.







###Chapter 18
Chapter 0018 “You never responded to my text.” “Nope, I sure didn’t.” Walking around him, I started cleaning up my station. “How are you feeling?” Alec pressed. “Like a million bucks.” “Dam mit Kristen. Can you just answer me?” His voice raised enough that Jasper and Emmy stopped flirting and looked over at us. “What do you want, Alec? I’m fine. Broken ribs aren’t new to me. I usually have them every other week. I do train as a warrior. I’m not a fragile girl that is going to fall apart and need a man to wait on them hand and foot. You dropped me off and left all . Maybe it’s you that needs to explain themselves.” My anger was rising. No one said a word as I cleaned my station a little too aggressively. Since I was mad, I twisted a little too fast and a shooting pain ran down my side. I had to hold on to the wall and take a deep breath till it went away. “Ice?” Emmys voice was quiet and unsure. noveldrama

“I’m okay.” Not wanting them to see water in my eyes, I went to the bathroom. It was a mixture if pain and anger. I was so stressed about my birthday and finding a mate that my temper was short. Pulling out a drawer, the Tylenol was there. Taking two 500mg pills should help. Finally, the water dried and I showed my face. A part of me hoped they would be gone but they weren’t. “Maybe instead of the club, we can have a picnic in the woods?” Emmy offered. “With all the rogue attacks?” I doubted the guys would be up for it. “I know a safe spot that I want to take you girls.” Jasper smirked.

“Why don’t you guys have some alone time? That sounds like a couple thing.” “I don’t want to ditch you.” Emmy frowned. “You’re not, I’m kicking you out.” I smiled at her. “Kris…” “Seriously, go. Enjoy each other. I’ll finish this work.” “I didn’t get much done.” Emmy frowned. “More than what I had done. Seriously, go. It’s really okay.” “Take the car.” Alec muttered and handed him the keys. Jasper grabbed Emmy’s hand and they took off laughing like kids in the candy store. “What work do you have?” Alec asked as I sat down in my office chair. “Just checking on the school stuff. Making sure things are in order. Balance the checkbook. Stuff like that.” “How much do you have left?” “Since Emmy types three words per minute, most of it. However, I just need a good hour and I’ll be done.” “What tattoos do you have left?” Alec looked at his watch. “Two more small ones. Just finishing up them really. Shouldn’t take long. You don’t have to hang around.” “I told Colt I would stay with you since the rogues have got too close to town. I guess Ace was unavailable for the job.” My hand froze over the keyboard for a second, which didn’t go unnoticed by Alec. “I see.” “You wouldn’t know why he is unavailable… do you?” Sighing, I looked up at him. “Just ask what you want to really ask.” I was getting tired of his fishing. “Are you guys involved?” “Why do you care?” “Answer my question first.”

“We aren’t involved. We had an agreement. No strings attached, drunk make outs only. Nothing more than that. Mainly because I’m saving that for my mate but I wouldn’t be able to keep my emotions out if it. Plus, getting emotionally involved with Ace would be bad if we weren’t mates.” “Plus the fact you want out.” Aleć filled in. “Yup.” I really popped the P as I started working again. “He apparently caught feelings and is upset I don’t feel the same.” “I see.” “Are you satisfied now? Did I fill your curiosity over something that has nothing to do with you?”







###Chapter 19
Chapter 0019 He was saved from asking as the door opened and my next client walked in. “Hey!” a “Hey, Polly! This is Future Alpha Alec. This is Polly, a pack member.” Polly looked nervously at Alec but showed him respect. “Get comfortable and use the bathroom if you need to. Let me finish this email and I’ll be right there.” “Perfect.” Polly was a looker. With long skinny legs, blonde hair and daggers for fingernails. She had the model b*dy but she was a sweetheart and one of my assistants. “Did you need help with any of that? I have the evening free?” “Actually, that would be great. I’ll balance the checkbook if you can do this?” I handed her the list of emails and phone calls. “I can do this while you work.” Since this was a thigh tattoo, her hands would be free. “Thanks, girl. You are amazing.” Alec took a seat in my office chair as Polly grabbed the phone and sat in the chair. It was an outer thigh so she was on her side. Her angle allowed Alec a clear view of her ti t s that popped out as her as s was pointed at me. To his credit, he turned his back and avoided eye contact. After a minute, his phone rang and he went outside. He stayed on the phone for the whole hour it took me to finish the massive flower arrangement Polly had picked put. Lots of vibrant colors really made her caramel skin look amazing. We both finished at the same time. By the time Alec walked back in, I was sitting on the floor, taking a picture of the tattoo and Polly was giving me a rundown.

“… The flowers and decoration will arrive on time. They didn’t have the shade of blue you picked so I changed it to a dark green. It will look good against the black still and go with the theme. Might need some adjustments. So I changed the accents to gold. As far as the carnival, everything is running on time. All vendors are accounted for and their deposits have gone through.” “You are amazing.” I tried to stand but fell back down. Sharp pains shot through me. “Kris!” “I’m okay.” I held up a hand for her to wait. My eyes were closed but I could hear Alecs foot steps. When they got to me, he sl*pped his arms around me, gently lifting me up. After making sure I wasnoveldrama

steady, he let go and walked away. “Broken ribs.” I said to a nervous looking Polly. “Oh shoot! I could have rescheduled!” “No, only when I twist does it hurt. Besides, you have been a big help!” +15 BONUS “Okay, well, I don’t have to write it down.” “No, you write it down.” I said as I went to sit down for a second. “Okay. I’m headed out unless you need anything else?” Penny said after a few minutes. “No, ma’am. Thank you for your help. It seriously was really helpful.” “Anytime! Bye!” She glanced at Alec before leaving. “You trusted her to get that work done?” Alec asked as he studied me. “She is one of my assistants. Has been for a year. Polly is amazing help.” 2 “How many do you have?” “Oh, three. They are more like employees for the different events I organize. I pay them a small wage but it looks amazing on college scholarships. They are all scholars that will be getting into Ivy League schools.” “How much pull do you have? This is way more than just an alphas daughter.” “I’ll make a deal with you. If we are mates, I’ll tell you everything. Until then, just think of me as a mysterious woman.” “Pain in the as s is more like it.” Alec snorted. “One of my many talents.” Standing up, I started cleaning up my mess and setting up for my last tattoo. 1 “see.” “So, I answered your question. Are you going to answer mine?” I pushed. “You can add pushy to your description.” Alec sighed “Just tell me why you would care.”








###Chapter 20
Chapter 0020 “To keep the peace between Colt and the packs. We have to get along and your protection is part of that.” That struck a nerve. “Protection?” “Yes.” “From what exactly?” “All the above.” “Like getting jumped in the girls bathroom?” It was a low blow but he pis sed me off first. His eyes narrowed. “Yeah.” He was saved as my last tattoo walked in. He was a human kid so no more pack talking. Instead, a grumpy Alec left the store and stood outside. My last client was named Trent. He was barely 18 and wanted a cross with a sunset background for his sister who died from a car crash. I had it all done but the color. I swear, men’s tolerance is much shorter than a female. “This should be our last session.” I smiled at him. “Good.” It was on his chest so I had the displeasure of being close and personal with a human joc k that

thought he was Go d’s gift to women. “Are you going to take my date offer?” “No. I’m not.” Sighing, this will be a long hour. Thankfully, Alec walked back in. Something was wrong by his stance. We couldn’t mind-link so I couldn’t ask. “Come on. It’s only dinner!” “Trent, I said no.” Pushing a little harder than needed, Trent flinched. “Ow!” “Sorry…” Alec glanced at me and I swear his l*p twitched. “Be careful woman!”

“I suggest you sit there and shut your mouth so I can finish or you will leave here with an unfinished tattoo.” He was grumbling under his breath but I just ignored him. Working quickly, I got him done. “I’ll take a picture and you are good to go.” “That looks good.” Trent was flexing his muscles in the mirror. “Thanks.” Clicking the picture, I turned to leave but Trent reached out and grabbed my hand. “I’m taking you out, let’s go.” “I believe I said no. Now leave.” Ripping my hang out, I started to walk away. Trent wasn’t taking no for an answer. “I didn’t give you an option.” Trent again grabbed my arm, a little too hard. Without thinking, I turned and punched him in the face right as Alec came over. Shooting pains made my vision go black as I heard Alec toss Trent out and lock the door. Trent pounded on the glass a few times but eventually walked away. I was holding into the wall for support. By the time I opened my eyes, Alec had shut the blinds and turned my neon open sign off. “You okay?” The gentleness of his touched surprised me as he took my hand in his. “Been better.” Taking my hand back, I walked to my chair and sat down. “You get guys like him often?” “Not too much. My reputation generally makes guys avoid me.” “I see.” Standing up, I made my way to my station to clean it. Alec just stood at the door, watching me. “I’m about done and I’ll give you a ride home.” “I’m in no rush.” “Not ready to be done working?” “Working?” noveldrama

“Did you not just tell me I was only a job to you?” Alex frowned. “Do you want to be more? Maybe have an arrangement with me?”. I saw red. “F uck you.” “How many guys have you had this arrangement with?” “F ucking jealous are you? Don’t act like you give a s hit about me.” I was mostly done. Grabbing my stuff, I walked out the store, not carting if Alec followed or not. Unfortunately, he was quick and got into my car before I could lock the doors on him. Neither one of us spoke as I rushed home. Most of the guys were “What’s wrong, Ice?” Colt walked up to me and glancing at Alec. “Nothing.” Stomping away from them all, I went right up to my bedroom. Slamming the door shut, I managed to make it to my bed before laying down.







###Chapter 21

Chapter 0021 A soft knock sounded on my door before it opened and closed. “Sis, what happened?” Why does turning 18 have to be so much pressure? I don’t want a mate, mates mean feelings and men are big babies.” Colt tried to hide the laughter from his voice. “Did Alec make a move? I seen the way he looks at you. I know why Ace is so pis sy.” “Ace knew the deal, no feelings. He broke that. He can’t be mad at me for sticking to the rules. Alec told me I was just a job to him, which for some reason stung. I am not a job.” “Who would think you would have guy trouble. If it makes you feel better, neither guy is good enough for you.” Colt laid down beside me. “What do you think will happen?” I didn’t need to elaborate for him to know I was talking about us turning 18. “We will find our mates and for you, that will go one of two ways.”

“Are you going to break up with Kara before that?” I asked, trying to get the conversation off of me. “We have had multiple conversations. I told her I was going into the party single and we would see what happens.” “I bet she didn’t like that.” “No. We agreed she would go in with her friends so it didn’t look like I ditched her since you and I will walk in together.” “Speaking of which, I have two dresses to decide on.” “Oh?” “One is black and one is a deep red.”

*Please wear the red as a big F.U to A nn.” Smiling, I turned to look at him. “Glad you agree.” “Don’t tell her that. Tell her you got a black dress.” “Technically I did. One will be for prom.” “Well, ready to go down to supper?” Colt asked. “Do I have to?” “Yeah, you kind of do.” Colt gave me a suck it up look. “As much as I want to get away from here, I’ll miss you.” “Let’s just wait and see what happens? Promise me you will talk to me before you take off?” “I promise.” And I meant it. Colt deserved that. “Good. Get changed and come down.” “Okay.” Colt got up and left my room. It took me a second but I was able to roll out of bed and look at myself in the mirror. My hair didnt look bad but not perfect either. The braid Emmy did was still okay so after applying a light layer of makeup, I put on dressy shorts and a V cut button up shirt. Grabbing a pair of sandals, I made my way down stairs. “It’s about time you show your face.” An ns shrill voice echoer off the walls. Alpha Marc, Alec, Jasper and Emmy had joined us. Ace was beside Jacob and Colt saved me a seat between him and Ace. “An n…!” Dad said in a stern voice. 3 Piercing my l*ps together, I took my seat and waited to be served. “It’s good to see you, Ms. Kris.” Alpha Marc smiled at me. I had opened my mouth to speak but An n jumped in first. “Alpha Marc, how are things going for you?” Fire burned but I did what I was suppose to and kept my mouth shut. Actually clenching my teeth together. Colt rubbed my back to help me relax. Looking at him, I gave him a half smile. “Everything is going great. I actually would love to hear about this tattoo shop.” My head instantly snapped towards Alpha Marc. The food started to come out. Looking at dad, he

nodded at me. “Thank you for asking, sir. It’s going very well. I have always loved drawing and this shop has really allowed me to get creative.” “Yes! You used to draw all over the walls and spill your paint on the carpet!” An n laughed. Dad shook his head in defeat, No one laughed but A nn.noveldrama








###Chapter 22

Chapter 0022 Thankfully, Alpha Marc ignored her. “I think that is excellent and something to really be proud of. Alec tells me you also are in charge of the prom, spelling bee and multiple other events as well enrolled in advanced classes.” Glancing at Alec, his face was passive. “Yes sir. I enjoy staying busy. Not sure what I would do with all that free time.” I gave him a polite smile. “I could think of a few things you could do…” An n muttered. Everyone continued to ignore her. The food was finished being placed. An open faced roast beef sandwich with mash potatoes caused my mouth to water. “I’ve heard rumors that you are incredibly smart. Is that true?” Ah, he was fishing. “Thank you for your interest but I would prefer if you just ask me what you really want to know…sir.” “Kristen! How very rude!” An n stood up and scolded me. Alpha Marc just laughed. “Calm down, Luna A nn. She wasn’t being rude but being direct. Okay, I would like to know what your IQ is.” 2 “If you don’t mind, I rather not discuss this matter. I have allowed Kristen to follow the path she wanted. Yes, most of the rumors are true that she could have sk ipped and went to college but she has chosen to

attend school to have the same experiences as the kids her age. I have granted a certain level of independence to her because she has shown me she is capable of it all. That is all I am willing to share unless she ends up being mated to someone of your pack.” Dad said firmly. The room was quiet as I kept taking little bite of the overly salted gravy. “I can understand and respect that. I would be protective of her too.” Alpha Marc spoke finally. The conversation tapered off and I was finally left alone. Jasper and Emmy where in there own world. It was hard not to watch their happiness.

“I’m sorry.” Ace leaned over and whispered in my ear. “No worries.” I gave him a small smile before returning to my glass of wine. This was a late supper so it was almost 9pm at this point and going out did sound like fun, “Yo Emmy.” I said in the mind-link. She hadn’t officially switched packs so we could still talk. “What’s up?” “I feel like dancing” “Oh?” “Well, just to get a drink anyway.” Emmy smiled at me before whispering in Jaspers ear. Whatever she said, he was game for. Looking at Alec, he whispered in his ear. “Anything you kids want to share?” Alpha Marc Caught on. “They want to go dancing.” Alec shrugged. “Try to not get into a fight this time.” Alpha Marc shook his head. “Well, my kids aren’t going.” A nn said as she went to stand up. “Excuse me?” It was Colt that spoke first. “Since when are we your kids?” Oh s hit. “Since I took over raising you brats!” “It’s fine. They can go.” Dad didn’t even look up from his plate. “NO! She still hasn’t been punished!” An n pointed a finger at me. Colt pulled my chair out and helped me stand. I was so shocked that it took me a second to move on my own.”I’ll watch over her.” Ace stood up and so did Jacob. Alec, Jasper and Emmy were right behind. “No time to change. Just get in the car.” Colt opened the doors and forced us all in. “What a piece of s hit stepmom” Jasper said. Muttered as Colt peeled out. I was in the front seat, forcing the guys to be shoulder to shoulder. “Did you say that you owned the club?” Alec asked. “Technically the pack does under the name but yeah, we run it together.” Colt nodded towards us. noveldrama

“It’s more his than mine. I just am the brains to get it running.” Colt had the club and I have the tattoo shop. “Is there anything you guys can’t do?” Jasper asked shaking his head. Turning, I gave him a genuine smile. 1 “I can’t pee standing up…” ” “Smartas s.” Jasper muttered as Emmy busted up laughing.







###Chapter 23

Chapter 0023 “Are we in a place I can joke with you and not get punched?” Jasper asked. “Yeah, you’re good. Emmy is basically my sister so by extension, you can be my brother-in-law.” “So does that mean I get to use your brains too?” Jasper asked in a joking but serious way. “HA! You wish!” It felt good to joke around and relax. Colt reached over and squeezed my shoulder. Taking a deep breath, I nodded at him and smiled. It was our own language. You twins are something else. Its like you have your own language.” Jasper noted “You have no idea! It gets weird.” Jacob spoke for the first time. “How?” I asked, looking back. “It’s like you know what each other think without the mind-link. He can take one look at you and know or vise versa.” Jacob crossed his arms. “Jealous I have a better connection with Colt than you?” Giving him a concerned playful look, Jacob looked sick. “Gross.” We all were laughing when the SUV pulled into the club. It was still early so there wasn’t a lot of people here yet.

The bouncer nodded to use as we passed and went straight up to the VIP room. A waitress by the name Denise came over to get our drinks. 1 “What would you guys like today?” “Jack Daniels on the rocks” I said, the thought of it made my mouth water. “Miller bottle” Jacob said. “Vodka and cranberry” Emmy piped up. “Whiskey too.” Colt said “Make that three” Alec said but was looking around and not really paying attention.

“Jim beam and sprite” Jacob said un a very flirty way. Denise even blushed. “Whatever beer is on tap.” Ace muttered. “Got it. Be right back.” “Hey, Alec. Why is Alpha Marc so interested in Ice’s brains?” Jacob gave no s hit and we could always count on him starting the conversations. “He was surprised by the fact she does all she does and then opening challenged Angela. Not many girls care about that in our pack.” “S hit, all we have are whiny prissy girls that cry when a nail breaks.” Jasper got a disgusted look on his face. “Can we not talk about me?” I said in a more annoyed tone than I intended. Jacob had the sense to drop his head like he was getting scolded. My aura didn’t come out but it was showing itself. “Sorry, Ice.” Jacob muttered. “No worries.” It was hard to cut out the annoyance in my voice. “What does our schedule look like these next few weeks?” Ace asked. “Well, we have our birthday party on Friday. The challenge on Saturday. The following Saturday is prom and then the week after that is the carnival.” Colt said. “Spelling bee is Tuesday after school but we dont have to go to that.” I added in. “Did you turn in the words?” Ace asked. “Yeah, they were all approved. We should be good to go. Polly finished my to-do list so I got left is the checkbook.” “And that is all yours.” Colt smirked at me. “Gee, thanks!” It was sarcastic but I was smiling. “Here we go!” Denise put our drinks in front of us. “Might as well make me another one.” I said as I took a large gulp. “Will do!” Denise swayed her hips as she walked away, leaving Jacob to break his neck watching. noveldrama

“Jacob, your hopeless” Emmy laughed. “What can I say, I’m a ladies man!” Jacob cracked his knuckles like he was getting ready to enter a fight. More and more people started filtering in. The boys were talking about fighting stances so I maneuvered out of the booth and stood at the balcony. Looking down, I could see the whole club. “Here is a refill!” Denise came out of nowhere right as my drink was empty. “Perfect, keep it coming.” It was hard for us to get drunk but we could ride out a buzz good. “You okay, gir!?” Emmy came and stood by me. “Oh yeah. These drinks are going down smoothly.” “Yes they are! “Emmy started swaying her hips to the music. “Colt thinks I should wear the red dress.” We had to yell as the music was getting loud.








###Chapter 24

Chapter 0024 +15 BONUS “That red dress was dam n fine” Ace had came over and joined the conversation. He kept a distance between is but it felt nice to talk to him again. “An n will be so pi ssed. I can’t wait. However, the prom decorations got changed a bit. They didn’t have the dark blue we needed to it got changed to Emerald Green and gold instead of silver.” “That black dress will fit in perfectly then.” Emmy exclaimed. “It will. You boys all have tuxes right?” “Yeah, I think we are good. Pretty sure we even got a limo.” Ace informed me. “Nice. Are you going to get ready with me or get ready over at your pack?” I asked Emmy. “I have to get ready with you. You are incapable of doing your hair and makeup. Now if that is at my place or yours, I dont know.” “I could…..try….” I made a face that Ace and Emmy laughed at. I could feel myself relax and start to enjoy the evening.

“You want to dance?” Emmy asked. “No, I’m okay. You can though.” My ribs were okay but I didn’t feel like dancing. “Nope, just making sure you didn’t want to.” That was a lie but I let it go. “Oh Ace, our bikes need service.” “Alright. I’ll see to it.” Ace was handy like that. “Thanks!” “At this rate, I’m going to be your personal waitress!” Denise came over again. “I’ll tip you well!” “Well, hold that thought. We had a bartender call in sick.” She gave me a sorry look. “Ooh, I’ll cover tonight!” It actually sounded fun. Yelling at Colt, “bartender called in. I’m going to have

some fun.” “S hit. Don’t go all Coyote Ugly again!” Emmy busted up laughing. “Coyote Ugly?” Jasper asked. “She was dancing on the bar one night…” “Hey, I made a lot of money that night!” I tried to defend myself but wasn’t working. Instead, I followed Denise to the bar. “Sorry about this!” Kyle was our main bartender. “No worries!” To say I was having fun was an understatement. No one asked me about my problems. They said hi and told me how good I looked. I made a series of rainbow shots. Between Kyle and I, we f ucking killed it. Occasionally I could see one of the guys watching me. It would rotate between Ace, Alec and Colt. Jacob would get distracted with a girl. If I didn’t like her, I would “accidentally” spill a drink on her. It wasn’t until last call that I realized how late it got. Kyle handled the rest as I finished cleaning the bar. Apparently it was Alec’s turn to watch me. “Alec!” I yelled. “What’s up?” “Can you change the tap? I can’t lift it right now.” Alex grabbed the barrel and rotated them out. I would be lying if I didn’t get some satisfaction from watching his muscles work. Dam n he was f ucking hot. “Thank you!” Smiling, I reset the machines. “Do you need help with anything else?” “Nope. We are just about done.” Walking out, Kyle was counting the money. “How was the night?” Alec was standing behind me. I almost wished his hands were on my hips. “It was a great night. Though, when your back here, it always is.” Kyle shook his head. “You got it from here?” “Yeah, here are your tips!” Kyle slid/over a pile of a couple hundred at least.

“Nope, pass them evenly out to you guys. You deserve some extra.” Pushing the money back, Kyle frowned. “One day I am going to force, you to take your tips.” “Good luck!” I smiled and waved as I saw Colt by the door.noveldrama








###Chapter 25

Chapter 0025 “So much!” I smiled big at him. I looked out the window as everyone was talking loudly still. “That was really impressive shot work!” Jasper yelled at me. Turning around, I had opened my mouth to respond but the yellow eyes running toward us caught my attention. “COLT!!!! ROGUES!” Right has it was out of my mouth, the rogue smashed into the vehicle. There was enough forced that the SUV fl*pped on its side. The passenger side slid a ways till it rammed into a tree. I felt the broken glass pepper my b*dy as my ribs protested. Something warm trickled down my face but my adrenaline started pumping. A rogue was trying to rip the windshield out. Thankfully, I managed to get my feet up and land a kick right to its nose, forcing it back. As quickly as possible, my wolf came forward. Shifting into a beautiful silver beast. Her name was Sierra and she was fierce. From what I could see, all the rogues were not as rabid as I would expect. They weren’t foaming at the mouth but their actions were wild. Some of the guys made it out and had started fighting. The rogue that was coming after me had lunged. Sierra dodged the attack before jumping on his back. Bitting’ down on his shoulder, she ripped a huge chunk of flesh away from the bone. Blood coated her mouth as his howls of pain caressed her ears. As she was about to go in for the kill, absolutely massive pitch black wolf came over and snapped his neck. Sierra was not impressed. Almost to the point that she wanted to nip at the black wolf. Her eyes didn’t

get to linger long. More rogues had shown up. Emmy was just as fierce as the guys but Jacob’s woman looked scared. Sierra pushed her behind a tree and stood guard. Colt was fighting two rogues but seemed to be doing. okay. The wolf who I knew as Jacob was playing with his rogue and Ace had his kill and was looking around for more. I assumed the stu pid other black wolf was Alec as his movements were as precise as

he was. Sierra was slightly drooling over his wolf. I assumed the other one was Jasper and he was looking around too. It looked like we had got them all or was finishing it. They f ucked with the wrong SUV. Finally, the rogues were killed. Colt shifted back and opened the back of the SUV. Pulling out a duffle bag, he tossed me two shirts before handing out shorts. Emmy and I went behind a tree and shifted back. The t -shirts were massive and covered the main parts but I still felt exposed. “You okay?” I asked the chick Jacob brought with us. Her tiny figure was crouched down as if trying to look like the dirt she was laying in. Two leaves covered her face. “I-i t-think so.” She was shaking as she was going into shock. “Come on.” Helping her stand, Emmy and I walked her over to the SUV and sat her down. Her back was “S hit, you okay?” Jacob came over and looked concerned. “She is going into shock.” Frowning, there wasn’t much I could do for her here. “Cr ap.” “Injuries?” Colt yelled. “Ice is bleeding.” Jacob looked at me. Touching my temple, I felt the stickiness of blood. “S hit, Ice, you got glass every where.” Ace had come over and examined me. His hands grabbed my shoulders and forced my head upwards to his. “There are tweezers in the first aid kit.” Colt yelled. Sighing, I sat down on a turned over log. “I’m not getting service. I’m going to run ahead and get help. Are you guys okay?” Colt asked. “Colt, you can’t go alone.” I was scared there was more out there. Pushing Ace away, I leaned around him to look at Colt. His phone lit up his face as he tried to look for a signal. “I’ll go too.” Ace sighed as he reluctantly handed over the first aid kit to Jasper. I saw his eyes twitch to Alec. Colt and Ace took off running. “I’ll do it.” Alec sighed. Emmy had been bitten on her ankle and was noveldrama

struggling to stand. Jasper was looking between us so when Alec said he would take over, a clear relief filtered across his face.







###Chapter 26

Chapter 0026 “Girl.” Looking at her, I laughed to tease her. Emmy was on the ground, trying to make her ankle injury go away with a rub. “F uck, I know.” She sounded angry. Tossing her hands up, she looked pitifully up at the sky. Alec gently took my chin as we straddled the log. I kept my hands down so my privates weren’t showing. Alec was gentle as he picked piece by piece, all the glass out of my face. “Most of this will be gone by morning.” I said, trying to make it sound like it was no big deal. “How’s the ribs?” He asked, completely ignoring my statement. “Actually, not bad.” “Probably still the adrenaline.” Jacob muttered. Looking over, he was watching Alec work. “Yeah.” Alec muttered. He had moved to my neck and collar bone. Enough he had to move my t-shirt. “Anymore anywhere?” With one hand, I opened my shirt to look. “Don’t think so.” The hell I was going to tell him regardless. “Need help looking?” Jacob joked. His date slapped him. noveldrama

We all busted up laughing. “What? It wasn’t like I was going to get lucky after this.” He was standing by her but not touching. She didn’t look like she cared that much anyway. “Jacob, you will never get lucky with me.” Laughing, I turned so I wasn’t straddling the log and crossed my legs. “Are you guys mates? You have really good chemistry together.” Jacob’s date was looking at Alec and I. There was an awkward silence. “I’m not 18 until Friday.” I said to her. “Oh…” “How far are we from the pack? Emmy asked quickly. She knew the answer but it got the topic changed. I

appreciated her tack fullness.* “A good ten miles. It will be a little but yet.” Jasper and Alec were walking around like they were looking for danger. The owls were hooting so I felt like the danger had passed. The longer we sat here, the quicker my adrenaline was wearing off, and the soreness was settling in. into my back regardless of my position. Each motion caused more pain. After a few tries, I gave up and laid in the ground. The dirt wasn’t the most comfortable but it was better than the tree. I was slightly sloped downward so I had to shift a little to make sure the blood didn’t rush to my head. “You doing okay?” Opening my eyes, Alec was looking at me. His hand twitched like he wanted to touch me but with all the eyes, he didn’t. “Ready for a shower and bed.” Closing my eyes again, I let the sounds of the night drift me off to sleep. I felt safe with the guys here. At some point Emmy joined me and we cuddled. Next thing I knew, headlights were shining on me. “Kristen!” Dad’s voice boomed, shaking the trees. I’m okay!” I said as I yawned. “Your head…” Dad examined me. Coming up to my as I was trying to sit up, his hands grabbed my head. gently. “It’s probably almost healed. Just little scrapes. Once I clean up, I will look good as new” I tried to stand up but it was still sore. “Here.” Dad picked me up and helped me stand on my own feet before Emmy helped me walk to the vehicle. “Jacob, take the girls home. We will finish everything here.” Dad commanded. “Yes, Alpha.” As soon as the vehicle started rolling, Emmy and I were out. We didn’t open our eyes until we pulled into the packhouse. “Emmy, wake up.” I shook her as I got out and we walked up to my bedroom. We both showered at the same time. Making the floor of the shower a brownish red. It stung a little but Alec was able to get all

the glass out nicely. Pulling out two sets of silk pajamas from my closet, I handed one to her, I got into the other. We both sl*pped into my bed. We were out as soon as our heads hit the pillows. I was vaguely aware of voices in my bedroom before I heard my door shut. I wasn’t even sure if Emmy was still in my bed or not but it was impossible for me to wake up and see what was happening.







###Chapter 27

Chapter 0027 It felt like my b*dy was on fire. Sweat had formed on my forehead before it sl*pped down my skin. Opening my eyes, someone was pressed up against me. It wasn’t until I sat up that I realized that Jasper left Emmy in my bed. “Morning.” My whole b*dy jerked as a new voice echoed in my room. Jasper was laying on my couch like a f ucking creeper. The blanket and pillow told me he slept there. “What the f uck, Jasper?” The bedroom door creaked open as Alec stuck his head in. “Coffee?” “What the hell are you guys doing?” My yelling woke Emmy up. I was very much aware that my silk pajama set wasn’t the most conservative. “Jasper slept here because Emmy was not moving and he text me asking me to bring coffee. I slept in another room.” Alec walked over and handed me a cup of coffee. Emmy got up, grabbed hers and sat down beside Jasper like this was an every day occurrence. “She isn’t a morning person. You’re going to have to give her some time.” Emmy sighed. It was too dam n early for this.

“I see that.” Alec snickered as he sat in the arm chair. “Why….” I wasnt sure which issues I wanted to address. “By the time we got home and everything sorted, it was almost 4am. Alpha. said to just sleep here. I was trying to move Emmy to another room but she wasn’t having it. So I slept on the couch.” Jasper filled me in. “Why didn’t you just go to another room?” I was clearly annoyed as I got up and went to my closet. My ribs were a little sore but overall, I felt decent. My b*dy in general was sore from the wreck but it

compared to doing a full b*dy workout. “Didn’t want to leave Emmy for a night. You will understand when you have a mate.” Jasper snorted like I didn’t understand him. Putting on a sports bra and some athletic shorts that probably could use an inch longer of material, I was ready to punch something. Grabbing some socks, shoes and a hair tie, I went back out to the bedroom/ livingroom area. “Not all of us are going to be attached to our mates hip.” I felt Alecs eye rank my b*dy. “Girl, you were just in a car wreck. Can’t you take today off?” Emmy said as she sipped her coffee. “That’s coming from a warriors daughter?” Frowning at her, my mood wasn’t changing. As soon as my shoes were on, I stood up and tired my hair back in a ponytail. “One day I will get you to realize taking a break is good for the soul too.” Emmy sighed. “Good luck!” I gave her a k*ss on the cheek before walking towards the door. “Please be gone by the time! get back.” I was talking to the boys. Just as I was about to shut the door, I heard Emmy. “She really isn’t a morning person.” I had just reached the stairs when I heard my name being called. “Kris?” S hit. “Yeah, dad?” Turning, he was in his office working. “What are you doing?” “Going to do some light weights. Work out the soreness. “Take it easy, okay?” He went back to his paperwork. I had only taken three steps when her voice sent chills down my spine. “Put some clothes in you little sl ut!” “Hello, A nn.” My whole b*dy froze as she turned the corner. “You didn’t turn in your accounting paperwork yesterday. “It’s not due till today. I’ll get it done and have it finished by 5pm.” I went to walk away but she grabbed my arm. “That’s not good enough. I want it done, now!” noveldrama

Ripping my arm back, “No. It will be done by 5.” “Excuse me? Who do you think you are talking to? I am your mother…” “You are NOT my mother. You are nothing to me.” I said through gritted teeth. A nn raised her arm as if to slap mé. “I wouldn’t do that.” A dangerous voice spoke behind me. It was Alec. He looked absolutely deadly as he walked up behind me. “You have no authority here! I’ll be sure to tell your father about this and how you spoke to a Luna!”







###Chapter 28

Chapter 0028 “Please do.” An n walked away, leaving Alec and I standing there. Not wanting to see the the pitty in his eyes, I started walked off too. “Thanks.” I called back as I sighed. “Spend the day with me.” Alec retorted. I keep up. H “Do what?” I didn’t even stop walking, making him have to was still only wearing the shorts. from last night. His bare chest was screaming at me to lick it. If I stopped walking, he might smell my arousal. “Spend the day with me.” He repeated. Opening the door to the gym, I was happy to see it empty. I went straight over to the treadmill for a warm up. “What do you have planned and why do you want to spend it with me?” Alec sat down on a nearby bench. “Just some general stuff. I wouldn’t mind having some company and having a female perspective.”

“Why not get a girl from your pack? Take Emmy, she will be your beta female.” “You’re going to pass up a chance to get out of your pack and get some fresh air? Plus, we can take our bikes. It is a little bit of a drive.” That peaked my interest. Glancing over, he knew he had me there. Getting off the treadmill, I put some gloves on and motioned for him to hold the bag. “Some people would think you are taking an interest in me.” I delivered a few good punched that made Alec take a step back. He underestimated me. “I’m not in a habit of caring what others think.” As I punched, his voice sounded a little winded. It was

hard to keep from smiling. o you are asking me for the soul purpose of doing a good deed by getting me away from here?” “So “Sure.” Alec leaned forward a little. “You In for a little adventure?” I didn’t answer, instead I finished punching until I was worn out. If I was going to ride my bike, doing legs were out of the question. “So?” Alec took a few steps back as I started taking my gloves off. My breathing was heavy, making my breast rise and fall. Alec had a hard time keeping his eyes on mine. More than once, I caught him “I need to balance the checkbook first.” Alec smiled a half smile. Dam n if I didn’t need a cold shower. “And a shower. You stink!” He was joking…. think. “Looks like you n you need more than a shower…” My eyes glanced down to make my point known. “I’m going to go take a shower and then I’ll be back to get you. We can get lunch first then head out.” Alec started walking away. “Take Jasper with you. Last thing I want is for him to claim my room as his since he had Emmy remove all her stuff!” Alec actually laughed as he left the room. I might as well be done with my workout. I needed to shower and be ready by the time he came back. Not sure how long it took him to get ready but his pack was like 30 minutes away from here. That gave me. around an hour and a half to shower and balance the checkbook on minimum. The world must be in my favor today as I walked up and didn’t run into anyone that would give me grief. The only thing that made me nervous was asking dad.

“Dad?” “Yeah?” “Alec as..” “He already asked permission to ask you. I’m okay if you go.” That stopped me in my tracks. “He asked you?” “Yeah. He knows his manners. Have fun, ride safe” Dad waved me off as I hesitantly turned to leave. What is happening? Walking to my room, I was happy to see it vacant. Bee-lining straight to the shower, I got rinsed off quickly. Washing my hair and b*dy. There was this weird feeling in me as I turned the shower off. I was excited. Looking forward to today even. So much that I stood in front of my closet, wondering what I was going to wear. It was going to be a hot one bit riding a bike mean a certain layer of protection. I had got a light weight black pants for riding that really let the wind breath through them. They were skinny pants so my chunky heel fit perfect with them. Those were not riding boots but it looked f ucking se xy with it. Finally, grabbing a white formfitting tank, I was satisfied. Tucking the tank into my pants, I was good.noveldrama







###Chapter 29

Chapter 0029 Since I was feeling good and se xy, I decided to blow-dry my hair. Emmy had been trying to each me to curl my hair but I still preferred curlers. After putting those in, I applied a light layer of makeup, with a simple black eyeliner. It was all I was comfortable doing. My watch said I had about thirty minutes to go. Sitting on my desk, I got to work. It wasn’t hard work but since my mind was pre-occupied, it was hard to focus. After three errors, I finally got it right. “Alec is here.” Dad mind-linked me. “Give me a second, I’ll be down. Is my bike out front?” “Pulled it around myself and checked it.” “Thanks dad!” Hitting send on the checkbook, then rushing to the bathroom to remove my curlers. I sent a thank you prayer to the Moon Goddess for giving me a good hair day. The curls looked great as I felt. After grabbing

my light weight riding jacket, I forced myself to walk out the door so they didn’t see my excitement. Thankfully, Alec was wearing the same style clothing as me, His had on riding jeans with a t-shirt. His leather riding jacket was on his bike but he had riding gloves on “Here is your helmet and gloves are inside.” Dad handed me my helmet as I walked up, smiling at them. “Where do you think you are going?” An n screamed from the door. “Riding.” I said as I put my jacket in. Alec got on his bike. “She can go, leave her alone.” Dad warned. “She hasn’t turned in the checkbook.” “Just did. Check your email.” I said as I quickly got on and started my bike. Finally, dad handed me my helmet, shaking my hair back, I slid it in. Alec handed me an ear piece so we could talk. After I was situated, we were finally leaving. I caught a glimpse of Jacob and Ace looking at us from the training field. noveldrama

Thankfully, they didn’t mind-link me. “You look good.” Alec said to me through the mic. “Thanks. These are new riding pants I’m trying out. Very breezy.” “Fit you like a glove.” “Lunch at Billy Deans BBQ.” My stomach growled in response. I loved BBQ. “Sounds good.” “Your dad said it was a favorite of yours.” Alec admitted. “What did you do? Ask my dad to take me out today and what food I liked?” “Kind of. I asked if you could join me on this ride. I need to look at some new ground for a possible venue. He was happy to let you get some fresh air and he offered a few suggestions. I think he knows you! needed a fun day and it so happened I could provide one.” My heart sank a little. “A pity ask?” “No! I genuinely wanted to spend the day with you. This just gave me the opportunity to ask. I figured your would say no to a date. Plus, your birthday is next week so no reason to call it that.” we! “Ah.” The rest of the ride was silent but it wasn’t far regardless. Since we were in our bikes, we shared a parking space. Alec was quicker to get off so by the time I got off, removed my helmet, he was watching me. I had just finished fluffing my hair and removing my gloves and jacket by the time I realized he wi watching. “Need help with that drool?” I teases. “You wish.” He gave me a half smile was I passed. I almost expected him to slap my was but he didn’t. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to flirt or not. The air condition felt amazing as we entered the restaurant.

 






###Chapter 30

Chapter 0030 “Ms. Kris! Its been awhile!” The hostess smiled as I walked in. “Too long!” I laughed. “Come on, I got a table for you two.” “Thanks, Ira!” “Anytime!” She waved as she walked away. I hated sitting with me back to the door but I guess the alphal in 2 Alec made it so he needed that seat. Sighing. I sat down. “Come here a lot?” Alec lifted his eyebrow at me. “Occasionally.” He tried to hand me a menu did I shook my head. “Creature of habit. I like what I like.” “Alpha Alec. Its good to see you again. How are you?” A waitress that I hadn’t seen before put her hand on his shoulder. Completely ignoring me. “Brittany,” Alecs tone said he was less than impressed. Moving her hand off him, he asked. “When did you

start working here?” “I just turned 18 and came to visit my grandma. They wanted me to do to some birthday party next Friday for some spoiled Alphas kids. Apparently, I need to find my mate.” My eyebrow raised at this. I decided to have some fun. “Birthday party? I heard about that. Do you know who they are?” Leaning back, I faked seeming interested. Brittany finally realized I was here. Pushing Alec over, she sl*pped in. “No idea. I hear there is two of them. Twins. A girl and a guy. The girl is rumored to have genius IQ but have quite the bit chy personality.

The guy is rumored to be f ucking hot and a ladies man.” Sounds about right. “Bi tchy attitude?” “Yeah, I guess she beat up some girls in the bathroom. They caught her flirting with her man and when they went to ask her to stop, she fl*pped out. Loose cannon. Though, I heard she is ugly so it may not matter. There was a challenge issues and the one girl said she plans on cheating to win.” That surprised me. “How can someone cheat in a challenge?” long. She has a target on her back.” I looked at Alec and I could see his demeanor change. Brittany was clueless. “What else have you heard? This is juicy stuff.” “That’s about it. Oh! I heard she also has a fling with the future Beta. Rumor is, he’s been stepping out and h ooking up with other girls behind her back!” Brittany made a face like this was juicy information. One, I do n;t believe that rumor and two, I didn’t really care if he did. “Interesting. Where do you get this stuff from?” I leaned forward like I was actually interested. “I can’t reveal my sources!” Brittany laughed Ira walked over to us, looking really nervously at me. “Um, Brittany?” “What do you want?” Her tone changed to a pretty ugly one. “Do you realize who she is?” “Just some wannabe girl that stands no chance now I’m back in town!” She gave me a fake smile. Reaching out my hand, I smiled in a b itchy way. “Hello, my name is Kristen. The female twin and the chick who’s birthday is Friday. I assume you are in Alec’s pack and I think he will agree with me when I tell you to be at Alpha Marcs office first thing tomorrow morning. They will want to have a word with you.”

Brittany face dropped. It took a second but she finally reached out a shaky hand. “I-I’m so sorry…” “Save it. I really could care less about what you said. Not all of it is true, however I would love to place an order.” “I think I’ll take over from here.” Ira said. Brittany walked off with her head hung. “S hit.” Alec muttered. “I’m so sorry, Kris!” Ira looked nervous. “Don’t sweat it. She actually gave us some information.” “Your usual?” Her voice was still shaking with nerves. “Yes, please! Tea with lemon today though.” “Perfect, and you, Alpha Alec?” “I’ll have the brisket special. Water.” He was trying to control his anger. “I’ll bring that right out.” Ira walked away to whom I assumed was the manager. Her hands were in her hips, glaring at Brittany. “You have girls everywhere.” Shaking my head, I crossed my arms over my chest.noveldrama








###Chapter 31

Chapter 0031 “She was a girlfriend my freshman year. She had an attitude problem, caused some issues so her parents. moved.” “I can’t keep beating your ex’s up. Anyone else?” “Why are you so chill about what she said?” Alec looked at me, still trying to control his anger. “Well, the rumors about Colt and I aren’t wrong. Plus she told us Angela is trying to cheat. We can stay ahead this way.” “She’s in the cells, she can’t cheat.” “Never underestimate a woman’s scorn. Ira came over with out drinks. “I got some appetizers for you to try. They are new to the menu. Let me know what you think!” “Thank you!” We each picked one up and bit into it. Juice ran down my face but the cheese refused to snap. Reaching over, I was able to grab a napkin as the spi cy reached my tongue. Stuffed jalapeno peppers. “Da mn, that’s good.” Alec almost moaned as he ate his. “Nope!” Finishing my bite, I ch ug ged half of my tea. Alec watched in humor.

“Can’t handle the spi cy?” “No. I’m a massive baby. Mild is too s picy for me!” My nose started running. Alec laughed as I had to blow my nose and fan my face. “Seriously?” “Yeah.” “Everything okay?” Ira looked at my face. “These are amazing.” Alec prised. I just smiled in response.

“Oh good!” Ira walked away as Alec grabbed another. “Where is this property at?” I asked. “About an hour east.” “That will be a nice ride.” I leaned forward and looked put the window. “Did you find a dress when you went shopping?” Alec was taking a sip from his water, His eyes drilled holes into me over his cup. “Two actually. One for my birthday and one for prom.” I smiled maybe a little too evil-like. “Uh oh, what’s that look for?” “The birthday is a black tie event.” “Yeah….?” “I have two dresses. One is black, the other is scarlet red.” “Let me guess, you are wearing the red one for your birthday:” “Colt even approved of it. I’ll make one hell of a statement.” “Good girl.” The way he said it and the look he was giving me, forced me to cross my legs. “Here are your plates! Enjoy!” The food smelled amazing. Grabbing the regular BBQ, I put it on my meat and started eating. “No bun?” Alec asked as he looked at my plate. “No, it falls out anyway.” “Fair enough” Alec took a few bites. “This is amazing.” “The best!” Smiling, I finished my pulled pork and side of fried okra. “Need anything?” Ira came over. “Just our check!” I said. Alec shook his head yes but his mouth was full. “It’s on the house!” “Oh no! Let me pay!” “Nope! Girl you come here a lot. Enjoy your day!” She walked away before I could protest more. “Ready?” Alec asked as he pulled out his wallet.

“Yes but I can pay.” “Nope. This was my idea, I’ll pay.” Alec laid a $50 on the table. “Ready?” +15 BONUS That was way more than an average tip, even if they charged us. The gesture was enough that I felt my heart swelling “Thank you for that.” I said when we got outside. “Even if they don’t charge us, having to work with Brittany is enough headache. She should get paid for it.” Alec sl*pped his helmet on. I got dressed and turned my bike on. “Ready?” I asked. “Yes, ma’am” Alec said before we got on the road to head out. We didn’t talk as we followed the windy road. Alec even took the back roads to look at the scenery. The flowers were blooming, birds were flying and I felt free. My heart was happy. I hadn’t realized Alec slowed down and was beside me, instead in front. “Enjoying yourself?” “Very much so. I love this. The wind in my hair, the open fresh air. I feel free and happy.” “Good.” Alec moved back into the front position but he kept looking at me in his mirror. Alec slowed his bike and made a turn. It was partially gravel but we only went a short ways before he pulled into a field. Parking our bikes, I was able to admire the view. As soon as my helmet, gloves and jacket were off, I took a few steps to get the full viewnoveldrama







###Chapter 32

Chapter 0032 We were on top of the mountain of a hill. Overlooking the city we just left. I was in awe over how perfect this view was. It would only be better at night. “What do you think?” Alec came up and stood behind me. Taking a breath, I didn’t have to back up far to be pressed against him. “This is beautiful. What an amazing view. How did you find this?” “We have owned this for generations. However, we haven’t used it or had a need for it. Lately, we been talking about making an event space out here. Something to bring in more revenue. However, we haven’t looked at the land in years. Dad wanted me to come look at it to see if it is possible. Get a sample of the ground to see if the soil is contaminated.” “What do you all own?” I asked. Alec sl*pped am arm around my waist and turned me. “From down about 15 feet to a few miles in each direction.” “When you say a few miles…” “I think we own around 500 acres.”

“Dam n.” Taking alec’s hand that he offered, we started walking. “There is a wooded area that if I remember correctly, is a waterfall.” “Oh really?” We held hands as we walked into the trees until the path became smaller. Taking the lead, I just followed the path for about a mile, until I hear the sound of splashing water. “Hear it?” Alec asked. “I do.” The breeze felt wonderful so I wasn’t even sweaty. After another hundred yards, the trees opened. up to a gorgeous waterfall to a steam below. “Oh wow.” “Just like I remember it.” Alec passed me and walked over to a rock that was sitting by the waters edge. Following him, I sat down next to him but there was still space between us. Not much though. “When were you here last?” “Oh, it’s been years. I was in elementary school, I think.”

So no girls brought here. “That long? Why?” nere, I guess.” “Ah. If I owned this. If be here everyday. Actually, I would have built my own cabin up here!” I laughed. “Well,” Alec laughed too. “It’s no beach or tropical place but you have permission to visit here anytime.” He put his arm around me and pulled me against him. My heart was racing. My head kept saying no but my b*dy was saying yes. Laying head on his shoulder, we sat like this for awhile. That is, until my curiosity got the best of me. “Alec?” “Yeah?” Scooting back so I could face him, he turned and looked at me concerned. “Jasper had this weird feeling about Emmy. “Yeah, he said he was just drawn to her.” “Emmy felt the same. Do you think we can tell who is our mates are by that feeling before we are 18?” Alec sighed and looked at the water. “Maybe. I’m not real sure.” “Do you feel that way with anyone right now?” “You mean you?” Alec called my bluff, “Yes or just anyone.” “I didn’t bring anyone here. I brought you. As for your question, I’m not sure. I’m not sure exactly what Jasper felt. What I do know is I can’t get you out of my head.” His hand came up and cupped my head as his thumb rubbed my cheek. I’ve never had this feeling or even wanted to do this with anyone. If that’s the mate bond, I don’t know.” I wasn’t sure what to say. He told me the truth. My heart fluttered but I was hoping for a defiantly yes, believe you are my mate. 2 “What I do know, everyday I look forward to hopefully see you. If you end up being my mate, I’ll be the luckiest dam n guy in the world. If not, I will be severely disappointed.”1 “Only because you won’t get to know my real IQ.” I joked to hide my real emotions. noveldrama

“Do you do that often? Joke to avoid talking about your emotions.” Alec asked. His hand fell from my face. I instantly missed it.








###Chapter 33

“Yeah. I just find it hard to open up. I want to. I want to let you hold me, k*ss me. Tell me everything will be okay. But come Friday, if you can’t give me that because you have a different mate, where does that leave me?”

Alec sighed and turned forward again. He put his hands on his knees. “I’m sorry.” Standing up, I went to walk away but Alec caught my hand.

“F uck it.” I heard him say before he whipped me around. His hand wrapped around my waist, pulling my again at him. His other hand wrapped around my neck, grabbing some hair and pulled my head back. Finally planting the most passionate k*ss I ever had. 

The moment his l*ps this line touched mine, I was putty to him. My hands wrapped around his neck as I sank into his hold. A soft moan escaped my throat as my eyes fluttered.

I never had this reaction to Ace. It gave me hope that Alec was my mate. Alec reached down and wrapped my legs around him before pinning me wrapped his hands around my thighs. Lifting me up, he against a tree.

As soon as his mouth moved to my neck, I knew I had to stop this. “W-we can-can’t go f u-further.” Grabbing his head, I started k*ssing him hard. My arousal filled our nose, enticing him him. His dic k wa pressed against my core. I was never more excited to finally go the way but I knew it needed to wait.

Our k*ss slowed as Alec set me down. One hand was on the tree, holding him up as the other was on my waist.

“I’m not sorry. I’ve never felt this way.” Alec whispered.

“Me too. I really hope you will be mine.” Alec didn’t respond but gave me a few more soft k*sses.

“We should get going.” He finally muttered.

“Okay.” I agreed but didn’t make a move. Opening my eyes, he was looking directly at me.

“You are so incredibly beautiful.” Moving my hair our of my face, he looked lost.

“What’s wrong?”

“If you end up not being my mate, I’ll be shocked and I’ll have to challenge whoever is for you.”

That both excited and scared me. If I didn’t have all these new emotions myself, I would be hearing a lot of red flags. Thankfully, a sound caught our attention and that forced us to move.

suching Gown, We made our way down the stream. There was a second waterfall and at the bottom was a group of fifteen rogues. They were just swimming, eating and chilling basically.

“We need to go.” Alec whispered in my ear.

Nodding we turned and started running back to our bikes. This was a hiccup that we didn’t plan on. Since It was only a mile to the clearing. It didn’t take long to reach our bikes.noveldrama

“Get on, let’s go.” Alec said urgently.

“Get your sample real quick!” The rogues hadn’t seen us yet and Alec looked nervous. Grabbing his stuff, he ran out into the field about 75 yards and started rotating a stick thing into the ground. I started getting my gloves an jacket on. As soon as Alec finished, I started hearing some rustling of the leaves. Alec must have heard it too because he came sprinting towards me.

Motioning for him to hurry, I put my helmet on and anxiously waited. It didn’t seem like the rogues knew we were here but I didn’t want to wait to find out.

Thankfully, Alec got to his bike right as the first rogue emerged from the trees. Alec shoved the dirt into his side pouch and got on. Ignoring his jacket and gloves. Only putting his helmet on, we started out bikes right as they spotted us.

I almost ate it as we peeled out but Alec reached over and steadied me while he was in motion. Not even looking back as our tires hit the pavement and we opened the throttle.

“Holy s hit. Are you okay?” Alec asked,

“Yeah, you?”

“Yeah. I’m good. Wow, that was…”








###Chapter 34

Chapter 0034 “Yeah….” …..” We ride in silence the rest of the way. The scenery was beautiful but I couldn’t decide if I was ready to be home or not. With our discovery, we needed to get home. Maybe even launch an attack. Take care of them before they take care of us. Alec even took the main roads to get home. Occasionally, he would make sure I was still behind him or ask me how I was doing but that was about it. to tell “This is my turn. Your dad is probably at your pack for you about the rogues.” I said to him as my turn was coming up. “I’ll make sure you get home okay.” “It’s really okay. Get home. I’ll be okay.” I could hear the hesitancy in his voice. “You sure?” “I’m good. Thank you for today. I’ll see you at school!” I tried to sound upbeat as I slowed down to turn. Alec kept going and as soon as I had turned, I could hear his bike really open up. As if he was driving slow for me.

It was only another 10 miles until I got home so it took no time. “Dad, where are you?” “Training field. Home already?” I didn’t answer as I drove to the front door. Taking off my jacket, gloves and helmet, I half ran to the practice run. “DAD!” “Kris, what’s wrong?” He stopped their drill, making all the guys turn and watch me. I “We were looking at the land. There is a wooded area that I was looking around at it.” I was not about to tell my dad what was happening there. Colt and Ace walked up as I talked. “Along a stream, there was a group of rogues. They saw us. We got away and got the soil sample but there was like 15 or 20noveldrama

of them!” “S hit dad, that’s not far from here. If they are setting up camp…?” “That’s Alpha Marc’s land, it;s his call but I’ll reach out and see if he needs anything. Did Alec go home to tell him?” “Yeah, I told him not to follow me here. That would be wasting time. If they decide to head this way and attack since we saw them and they saw us….” “I’m calling.” Dad pulled out his phone to show me it before dialing. I was aware of the looks I was getting but I did my best to ignore them. asked me as he tOL my shoulder. “Just worried they will attack, I’m good.” “LISTEN UP!” Dad yelled. Everyone was instantly alert. “Black team, lets go!” Turning to Ace. “You’re in charge.” “Yes, sir!” Ace said extremely seriously. A group of 15 men ran forward and followed dad and Colt as they ran off. I assumed to help Alpha Marc. “Is there anything else you want to add?” Ace asked me in a very accusatory tone. “What exactly are you implying Ace?” “Just asking a question.” His eyes narrowed at me. “I don’t like it.” He didn’t have to explain what he meant, I knew it. “Sounds like a you problem.” I said before turning around and walking off. As much as I was concerned about the rogues, I still needed to be responsible to finish all, if any work gets done for all the events. It was hard to focus but after a few hours, I was finished with every single project for the rest of the ye Thankfully I had finished the other projects this week and budgeted the checkbook so I was able to for on the rest. It wasn’t until I was getting ready for bed that there was a knock on the door. Since I had locked it, and

the entire packhouse was soundproof, I had to answer the door. “Hello?” “Hey, just figured I’d tell you, we were able to stop any attack. We met Alpha Marc just as the rogues were at the edge of town.” Dad was standing there covered in dirt. The sweat had dried and his smell was thick.







###Chapter 35

Chapter 0035 “Thank you for letting me know.” I said as I tried to hold my breath. “Headed to bed?” “Yeah, getting ready for school tomorrow.” “Big week next week.” Dad was fishing at this point. “What is it, dad?” His hand went up and rubbed the back of his head. “Did you find a dress?” “Yes.” “One that fit the theme?” F uck.. colt wouldn’t have ratted me out. 1 got two dresses, one for my birthday, and one for prom.” I didn’t want to lie. “Wear what makes you happy.” Dad said after a pause before turning and leaving. “That was weird.” I said to out loud to myself as I shut the bedroom door. Turning the lights off, I fell asleep right as my phone dinged. After a small internal debate, it wasn’t worth me moving so I finished

going to bed. Monday mornings are literally the worst. This Monday was the worst one yet. Not even out of bed and I knew today was going to suck. An n is going to be going crazy with the birthday party and the challenge in Saturday. So many people will be coming and going all week. Tension will be high and I’ll be the target for her stress relief. Not to mention the fact I may find my mate on friday. If it was Ace, there would be no escape. Part of me always had this connection to him. It was so easy and effortless. We just flowed and it came naturally. Then there was Alec. He was a wild card that I didnt fully believe in. He was the hottest f ucking guy I’d ever seen and boy could he k*ss. The reality of him being my mate was slim. We fought and our tempers clashed. Like oil and water.

Reaching over, I was able to grab my phone without moving too much. I was feeling almost normal at this point. That was, until I saw I had two messages. One from Ace and one from Alec. Ace: Happy Birthday week! Try to have a good day. It was sent at 6:03am. The clock said it was 6:45am. Texting back, I said thanks before pulling up Alec’s message. Alec: Everything got handled. Site has been cleared for construction. Thanks for your help. That was sent right before I went to bed. I didn’t feel the need to reply. Instead, I just got up and took a quick shower. I could s kip today but that would mean more An n so I opted to go.. I didn’t feel like messing with my hair so I braided it to the side, applied some light makeup before dressing in basic shorts and t-shirt. It was suppose to be a hot f ucking week. Picking up my phone, I pulled up Emmy’s name before remembering she isn’t here anymore. I’ll be going to school alone. Frowning, I just grabbed my bag and walked out of my room. “About time you woke up.” Ace was standing right outside my door. “S HIT!” his presence startled me. “What are you doing?” Holding up a muf fin and a water, he smiled. “I came bearing gifts.” The chocolate smelled delicious. Sn atching it, I just glared at him as we started walking. “What’s the occasion?” “Emmy isn’t here to accompany you. So if figured I’d fill in.” He shrugged. I “Thanks.” I said maybe a little too chill. He gave me a weird look. “Want to take my car?” He asked as he opened the garage door. “No, you have training and I have to go to the shop.” I sighed as I walked over to my bike. okay, we will do “What’s up. Ace? You have never done this before.” Stopping at my bike, I just straight up asked him. “An n is already on it. Colt assigned one of us to escort you while at the pack house until you find your mate.” Ace always told me the truth. noveldrama

“Ah.” Putting on my helmet, we got on our bikes. Putting the rest of the mu ffin in my side container, we drove off. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! I may not post tomorrow but I will be back on regular schedule in July. My kiddo hast-ball! 28








###Chapter 36

Chapter 0036 It was a quiet drive, nothing out of the ordinary. Crisp morning air was already warming up. We got there a little early so after we parked our bikes, we sat on a picnic bench to finish eating. The sun felt amazing in my face. “Thanks for the mu ffin.” I told Ace. “Yeah well, you didn’t have that. I snuck it out when the kitchen gals were cussing someone out for sneaking food before it was ready for e everyone.” They were strict kitchen workers but they did dam n good work. 1 That got me to smirk a little as I took a bite. “Breaking the rules taste so good.” “So, you going to wear the red dress?” Ace asked with a glimmer of something in his eye. I “Speaking of which, did colt say something to dad about that?” My eyes narrowed as I asked.

“Wwwwhy?” “Dad said something to me.” “So you’re wearing the red one.” Ace nodded as he looked behind me. Emmy was walking up with Alec and Jasper. “You’re here early!” Emmy gave me a side hug but didn’t sit down. “You weren’t there to make me late.” I teased. It was me that made us late in the mornings. I had to squint looking up at her. “Yeah, okay. I’ll see you guys at lunch.” Emmy waved as they walked off. Sighing, I just turned back to finish my m uffin. I watched as they walked away. She was holding hands with Jasper but there was a level of authority round her now. “You okay?” Ace asked, bringing my eyes back to him. More and more kids were showing up and I only had five more minutes of free time, However, I needed to get my books and print off some papers. “I’m good. I need to go to the library though. See you at lunch!” Jumping up, I headed towards the door.

He was right behind me the whole way to the library. The bell dinged as I was hitting print. I wasn’t too worried as the teacher was part of the team that handles the extracurricular activities. I was literally handing him all of the organization, list of supplies and numbers for every single event left this school year and for next year. Usually, I don’t get that done till the summers. Not that I particularly liked college level economics but it will look good on an application. As soon as I walked in, Mr. Ford pulled down his glasses and looked at me. H O”Miss Kris, running late?” “Yes but I have this for you.” Smiling, I walked up to him to hand him the papers I just printed out. “This is wonderful. Thank you. Take a seat.” Looking over, my usual seat was taken but Angela’s minions. Leaving the only seat open next to Alec. Wonderful. “I see I’m not the only one taking advanced classes.” I muttered as I sl*pped into my seat. “This classes were made to entice you to stay.” My b*dy froze as he said those words. Although he wasn’t wrong, he wasn’t fully right. They were being discussed before I came around. Dad just gave them the push they needed. “Partially true.” Leaning back, I crossed my arms and ignored Alec’s presence. This was awkward. We had that non-date day and k*ssed but now we are sitting here like strangers or enemies even. The sh itty thing. he was in almost all of my classes. As soon as the bell rang, my a ss was up and out the door before anyone could stop me. I had to ski ppe my locker earlier so I had to grab my books. As I turned the corner, there was a group of girls laughin outside of my locker. noveldrama

My stomach dropped as there was only one person with enough balls to do this. “What’s going on?” Colt walked up beside me. “Haven’t figured it out yet.” I sighed. “Allow me.” Colt walked forward and growled at the girls. They all instantly sca ttered but then I was able to see what they were laughing about. There was pictures of me dancing with Ace and with Alec. Above it read: ‘s lut ice princess playing the field”







###Chapter 37

Chapter 0037 Colt angrily ripped it down before storming off. “Colt!” Yelling after him did nothing. Instead, I watched in horror as he ripped open a door and stepped inside. I “Alec! Outside! NOW!” I was curious how he knew Alec was there but now wasn’t the time. Colt took off walking as a mixed anger and confused Alec stepped into the hall. Looking at me and at the back of Colt, his demeanor asked me the f uck that was about. Shaking my head, I followed Colt outside. Alecs presence was very much known as I followed Colt. It wasn’t until we were outside that I could breath. “Colt? Care to explain?” He was trying to hold in his own anger. Colt was not doing as well. “Explain this!” Colt slammed the poster into Alecs chest with enough force to make Alec take a step back. Alecs eyes drew black as he looked at it

“Where was this?” “ON HER F UCKING LOCKER!” Colt yelled so loud the windows shook “No one is going to do anything” I said looking between the two. “Ice, look…” Colts voice was still elevated. “Watch your tone” I said as I glared at him. He instantly chilled out. “I’ll be settling this in the ring on Saturday” “That’s probably best.” Alec muttered “Seriously?” Colt looked pis sed at Alec. “Colt, it will only make things worse. Let me handle this my way.” “No, that’s the f ucking issue. You are petty as f uck. You will hit them where it f ucking hurts and all hell will

break loose.” Colt roller his eyes at me. 1 “Seriously?” Alec looked at me. “Where do you think Ice came from? I don’t play fair. I’m not someone you want to p iss off. I have my dad’s temper.” Shrugging, it wasn’t a big deal to me…. Others may not agree. “That might be entertaining to watch.” Alec smirked. “Don’t encourage her!” Colt was slowly looking his mind. “Listen, I’ll take the high road but if one more thing happens, all gloves are off.” Looking between the two of them, they nodding in agreement. “Well, we have 30 minutes till our class is over then lunch.” Alec looked at his watch. “I got to go signed up for the S.A.T.s.” turning, I headed back in. “Yeah” Colt muttered “Me too.” Alec followed us in to the office. It was a short walk but since the hallways were empty, everything echoed. Even the sound of giggling girls. Sl*pping off my shoes and tiptoeing to the corner, I looked over. Angela and her gang were putting another one up. I felt Alec move beside me. Instantly, I put my hand on his chest to stop him. Shaking my head no, I walked quietly behind them. There were a few ways I could play this. Right as I was about to smash her head against the locker, something glittery caught my eye. Angela’s journal was sticking out of her bag. Grabbing it, I hid it behind my shirt. “Little crooked, move the right up a little.” The girls jumped and the poster fell. A can of spray paint roller on the ground to my feet. Picking it up, I looked at them. “Well, isn’t it the s lut of the school.” Angela stepped forward. “The only reason you are breathing, is the fact I don’t want any excuses for you to miss Saturday. I’m going to enjoy teaching you a lesson.” Taking the spray paint. I put a dot on her stomach. “Here will be my first punch. Then here and here.” noveldrama

“You b itch!” She shrieked. One girl on the right tried to come at me. Chopping her in the throat. She went down. “Anymore?” As she was on the ground, I sprayed Xs over her eyes like she was dead. “A-alpha?” Frowning, Colt and Alec stepped around the corner. “She attacked us!” “Lying now? Come see me in my office after school.” Alecs eyes were pitch black and s exy as f uck. Angela got a half smile. “Like old times.” Looking him up and down, she licked her l*ps. “Yes Alpha.” They grabbed their friend off the ground and left. Colt had already started cleaning up.







###Chapter 38

Chapter 0038 “Why did you stop me?” I was disappointed. Colt just gave me a look. “Ice, c’mon,” Pulling out her journal, I started skimming it. “Yeah, yeah. See you boys.” Walking off to the cafeteria, it was already filling up. Putting the journal away, I waited in line. Colt walked in and sat down beside Kara. She looked happy but was at the same time. As soon as I got my lunch, I felt someone tap my shoulder. “Hey girl! Come sit with us!” Emmy had a huge smile on her face. Looking at their table, Alec just sat down. Looking at my table, Ace was staring at me. “Maybe tomorrow. I’m actually not hungry.” Throwing away my food, I bee-lined right out of there and went outside. The wind caused my hair to whip my face as I kept going. I expected Emmy to follow me, or even Ace but it was Colt that caught up to me. Gabbing my shoulders, he forced me to turn and look at him. 1 “What’s wrong? You never let that girl stuff bother you before.”

“It’s not them. Well, not directly. It’s everything. You realize we will be 18 in four days. For you, nothing changes. For me, everything changes.” I wanted to confess my feelings to him but something stopped me. “Come sit,” Colt took me to a near by tree and we sat down. He put his arm over my shoulders to comfort. me. “Tell me what’s really bothering you.” “Why do yo-“I started “Don’t. The truth.” “S hit. Everything. What if Ace is my mate? I’ll be stuck here. This whole time we said no feelings and if one of us developed feelings, it would stop. He never told me and now if we aren’t mates, he will be hurt.” noveldrama

“What about Alec?” Colt asked. “What about him?” Colt hear my heart s kip a beat. “Do you think he is your mate?” The million dollar question. “It just feels different. Ace is like a protector, has been my whole life, but Alec feels like an equal. He doesn’t know me like you guys do so he just lets me do my thing.” “That’s not what I asked.” “Alec offers a new place to live away from A nn.” “Kristen, stop thinking with your head and start feeling from your heart. Your head isn’t going to tell you who your mate is. You have no control over that. Only your heart has these answers.” “Yeah…” I said lamely. “I see the way Alec looks at you. You can’t feel guilty for letting go of a childhood friend for your mate.” “So you think Alec is my mate?” I smirked looking up at him. “I just think you can’t feel guilty if it isn’t Ace.” Colt have me a half smile. “Will you feel guilty if it isn’t Kara?” I asked. “In a way. She isn’t Luna material but I do have feelings for her. I don’t think I’ll have as hard as a time letting her go.” He didn’t need to add the last part for me to understand his direction. ‘I just want to go to the beach and hide away” I half joked. “Maybe for a graduation present.” Colt laughed as we stood up. “If I’d known that. I would had graduated 4 years ago.” “HA! I’ll see you later.” Colt said as he walked off. “Not forcing me to go to class?” I asked looking at the school “Naw, take the afternoon off.” A huge smile crept across my face. Colt came up and k*ssed my forehead. “Just don’t make me regret this and find trouble.” “I’ll go right to my shop.” I promised. “Good.” Colt turned back to the school and I turned to go my shop. It felt good and my spirit was lifted. I was such a good mood that I didn’t pay attention to what was going on around me.

Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! Please leave a gem and help me out! 22







###Chapter 39

Chapter 0039 Unlocking my shop, I was able to turn the lights on and set my stuff down. Grabbing the journal, I found some good entries. Nothing too bad but enough to blackmail her. I was making copies when the bell rang that someone opened my door. “Hello? I’m not open right now!” I yelled. No answer. I felt the presence of someone in my shop. My internal bells were going off. “Colt, get the guys and get to my shop. Something is wrong.” I mind linked Colt. “What’s happening?” I didn’t answer, instead, I kept the link open as I walked out from behind the wall. “Can I help you?” I asked, firmly. There was three men standing in my shop. They all gave off authority and danger vibes. Unlike Alec, they looked scary and dangerous as f uck. Hair in a bun, neck and face tattoos and piercings. Everything in me told me to keep my distance. I was no match for three massive guys. They stood over 6’5 and muscular.

Not b*dy builder style but that didn’t fool me, “We hear you are the place to go for a tattoo.” His voice was like ice running through my veins. My first though was, where is Alec when I needed him. “I don’t believe I got your name.” I stated as I kept my back straight. “Forgive me, beautiful. My name is Darin. This is Steven and Cash. Perhaps you heard of us?” “Holy f ucking s hit.” Colt cussed in my head. “I’m coming!” “Can’t say I have.” I told them as I didn’t move. Something moved in the back of his eyes. Anger? “Let me properly introduce myself to you, Miss Kristen. My name is Darin Knight of the Midnight River Pack. This is my future beta, (Steven nodded) and gam ma, ( noveldrama

Cash nodded).” Holy s hit was right. They don’t play nice with others. Everything in me told me to run away. “I assume you want a tattoo?” I sk ip ped the pleasantries. “Come on now! I wouldn’t want to have a miscommunication and think you aren’t being friendly. My father, Alpha Rip would appreciate that from the daughter of Alpha Brian.” Steven and Cash shared smirks as they shifted in their spots. “I don’t my father would be too happy to hear what’s going on here without his approval. This shop is his territory and I don’t believe you were invited in.” It was the only other thing I could think of to try to get them to back down. “You are a feisty one.” He took a few steps closer to me. His eyes never left mine as he got closer and closer to me. Standing inches in front of me, his hand moved the hair off my neck and his face moved down so he was whispering in my ear. “I like you.” “Step away from my sister.” Colt’s voice was think with authority. I was proud of myself for keeping my head up but I was shaking internally. Darin just laughed as he took a deep breath before he stood up. “I assume you are Colt.” He stood at his full height and turned. He was taller than Colt as I underestimated their height. Ace and I took a few steps away from Darin and looked over at Colt. He brought everyone. Not Jacob but Alec and Jasper. All of them looking rather pi ssed off. I found myself looking between Alec and Darin. “I am and you are very much aware of the rules you are breaking right now.” “Don’t get your panties in a twist. I was just here to introduce myself to this beautiful woman. I wante seek her services” The way it said it made it sound dirty. Almost S**ual by the twi nkle in his eyes. “Her books are full” Colt continued.

“We were not told you were back in town.” Alec spoke up. “And you are…?” Darin rocked back and forth on his feet. “Alec, son of Alpha Mark of the Blue Fang pack.” “Great, able to meet everyone. Since we all share the same cities, I was hoping to meet up.”








###Chapter 40

Chapter 0040 “You were suppose to be overseas for another year.” Colt said blanty. “Came home. Got an invitation to a birthday party?” I was cussing out An n in my head for sending them one. “I heard you found your mate already.” Alec stated. “Unfortunately, she didn’t make the cut. I am in search of a replacement.” He turned and looked at me. “Yup” he licked his l*ps as he looked me up and down. “She isn’t 18 yet.” Colt said. “Neither are you. That is, until Friday, I’ll be waiting to see who I will be challenging for her hand.” After nodding, the three guys walked out of my shop. Getting into their sports car and sped off. I was just frozen in my spot. What the actual f uck just happened? My eyes stayed on the door. His words echoed in my head. ‘who he will be challenging for my hand’. “Kris!” Colt had me by the shoulders and shook me. Snapping me out of my trans, I finally looked up at him.

My mouth opened about nothing came out. My tongue was dry, my nerves were shot and my energy was drained. Colt just pulled me into a hug. “When did he f ucking get back? Jacob was on a rampage. “This isn’t good.” Jasper agreed. “Can you guys come over for a meeting? Colt asked Alec. “Of course. We will be there in an hour.” Alec looked at me. “You okay?” All I could do was nod. That seemed to satisfy him and they left. “We need to get home. Cancel your appointments.” Grabbing my appointment book, I held it close. “I’ll do it at home.” I had never wanted to go home to the pack house so bad before. Colt nodded as he grabbed my bag and watched me lock the door. Climbing in Jacobs car, he dropped

Ace off at my bike. Ace rode it home for me so I could stay in the car. The whole thing took about 45 minutes before we were back. “Kristen, go to my office. Make your calls and stay there.” Dad was angry. Nodding, I took off running. As “No, I’m not going to f ucking cry.” I yelled at myself. Keep your head up and focus. Opening my book, I dialed the first person. “Hello?” “Graham, this is Kris. I’m going to have to reschedule. Something came up and dad is requesting I am present for it.” It wasn’t lie. “Dam n, okay. Just let me know what works.” He was a pack member so he couldn’t argue with a command from dad. “Thursday at 4?” “Sounds good. Thanks!” We hung up and I called the next person. It went about the same. The last person was a human and would be more difficult. “Hello?” He sounded angry. “This is Kris, I am going to have to reschedule your appointment to day as something came up and I will not be in the shop.” “That’s bulls hit. I already paid and I want my tattoo finished.” Dad and everyone walked in. Including Ale Marc, Jasper and Emmy. “I understand that and I apologize for the inconveniences but this is unavoidable. Can you come next week?” I’ll have to call you back.” Click! Frowning, I put my phone down. Everyone was looking at me, waiting. “Kris! Are you okay?” Emmy sat down beside me, looking very concerned. I just looked at her. Not sure how to answer that. Looking at the room, my eyes landed on Colt. Givingnoveldrama

that twin vibe to get him to change the subject. “Dad, why was an invitation sent to them? They aren’t allies!” Colt was pis sed. Emmy tried to put her arm around me but I pushed it off and stood up. If I let her comfort me, I might c rack. “An n, get in there.” Dad pressed the intercom button, calling for An n. No one spoke as we waited for her. I moved to the window and looked down. 1 “Hune-” An n walked in thinking it was just dad but when she saw everyone, she frowned. “What’s going on?” Her whole tone changed.







###Chapter 41

Chapter 0041 “Did you invite the Midnight Moon pack to the kids party?” Dad asked. “I did. It was the polite thing to do.” “How st upid could you be? His son has threatened Kristen!” Colt blew up. “Don’t forget who you are talking to!” An n shrieked. “AN N!” Dads voice boomed. “This is serious. He threaten to challenge whoever is mated to Kris. This is a big f ucking deal!” “Who knows, maybe he will be her mate. Plus, she wanted out of here so badly, go be with him. I hear he travels a lot. Besides, having a firm mate will be good for her”- The room was quiet. Everyone’s jaws dropped. I’m not sure what happened. I was looking out the window one second and the next… I had walked up to An n, looked her in the face and slapped her as hard as I possibly could. Arms wrapped around me instantly and pulled me back. No one comforted An n. She was on the floor bleeding but Colt stood between us. noveldrama

I wasn’t fighting whoever was holding me but my fangs and claws were out, ready for a fight. “An n, go to the hospital and get checked out. I command you to not tell a soul what happened.” Dad sighed as he didn’t move from his seat. An n got up and left the room crying. Only after she was gone, did dad stand up and walked in front of me. He put his hands on either side of let go. I felt my face and looked at me. “Calm down. Breathe.” Dad nodded as whoever was holding me him taking a few steps back before dad put his arm around me and sat me in An ns seat. Looking over, it was Ace that stopped me. His eyes were slits as he stared at the ceiling. “Nothing we can do now.” Dad muttered “It will start a war and we need to play nice. See what his next move is. They are a wild card.” Alpha Marc started.

“We are bigger than him!” Jasper cracked his knuckles. “We don’t want a war. We need to play this correctly. So far, it was just talk. He violated the treaty by going Into your shop. I’ll call Alpha Rip and have a word with him “dad sighed. “What about Kristen’s safety?” Colt started. “He isn’t going to school. Keep doing what your doing. So far, other than threatening to challenge her mate, he hasn’t threatened her.” Dad started. Dad! No! She can’t go to school!” Colt continued on.. “I can and I will.” The room froze as they looked at me. “I’ll accept your protection but I will not allow him to stop my life. I will not hide out in my room like a scared little girl. No, I am an Alpha female, daughter of Alpha Brian and I will not be scared so easily.” My voice sounded much more sincere than my heart felt. “Kris, think about this.” Ace pleaded. *I have. You guys have no idea what it’s like for a girl. Everyday we are S**ualized, treated like dirty because we aren’t as strong. I am not the lay down and take it type of person. I will not allow him to think he can get away with being inappropriate to me. He will not have that affect on me. I will gladly die before I allow an any man to think he is above me!” Slamming my fist down, dads desk cracked down the edge. I could tell they weren’t happy but I didn’t give them a choice. “If he threatens her safety, she stays put.” Ace stood up like he had any say in any of this. “I don’t think it’s her safety we need to watch out for. It’s the physical aspect that is in question.” Alec spoke up. Ace puffed out his chest like it is a competition. Alec responded and stood up too. “Either is none of you concern. Last I checked, she was still a member of this pack.” Ace stated. “For now.” Alec was taller so Ace had to look up.

###Chapter 42

Chapter 0042 “Alright boys. That is enough.” Marc stood up and separated them. “She will need an alpha male to defend her honor against Darin, not a beta.” Alec said. Colt jumped in and pulled Ace back before he could punch him, “ACE!” Dad commanded. “Go cool off!” Ace slammed the door open as he stormed out. Jacob followed him but Colt stayed. “Low blow, dude.” Colt said to Alec. “I’m not wrong. It will take Alpha blood to beat and alpha. I’m the best shot she has.” “Assuming you’re her mate.” Dad said leaning back. “Correct, sir.” “And you truly believe you are?” “I’ll know for sure as the week goes on but currently, yes.” Alec didn’t even look at me. “This is your call, Brian. Regardless of mates, she is your daughter.” Marc shrugged as he looked at him “I will assign a warrior to guard her. There will be too much testosterone if you boys do it. If one thing happens, your as s is stuck here till Friday.” Dad said the last part looking at me. “Fine.” It was better than nothing. noveldrama

“You kids can go. Marc and I will call Rip.” Dad excused us. “Kris?” Emmy said, quietly, “I’m good, girl.” I said as I hugged her. “Let’s get from fresh air. We walked arm in arm as the boys walked behind us. There was a porch swing that we sat on. The boys either leaned against the wall or against the railing. “It’s a beautiful day “Emmy said. “How’s things going for you?” I asked wanting the conversation off me. “It’s been great. Different. Usually stuff but since I’ll be beta female, I have a list of duties that I am

learning. I never realized there was so much!” “You will be so good at that. You have a knack for that stuff” I said to her. “Thanks. Jasper’s mom has been amazing but I really miss you.” “Aw, I miss you too.” “Do you think! can come get ready here on Friday?” “Yes please! I wasn’t sure who was going to do my hair and makeup” I was so relieved. “I know. Jasper said it was okay. Him and Alec will meet me here. I’ll go in early so I’ll be sitting with them. when you and Colt enter.” “Not looking forward to that.” “Please tell me you are wearing the red dress?”Emmy got really excited. “I am. After today, you bet your a ss I am.” “Speaking of the devil” Alec muttered. He nodded towards the wall way. An n was being brought back. Are you going to be in trouble?” Alec asked me. 1 “No.” Colt said sharply. “At least according to dad.” I said as A nn got out. The bruise on her chin was growing. Even had a s in her l*p. “Just wait you little bi tch…” An n sneered as she walked inside. me stay with 127 “Maybe you can Emmy asked looking at Jasper and Alec. “Obviously she is more than welcome but that’s up to Colt and Alpha Brian what is best.” Alec stated politically correct. “Maybe I can stay Thursday night?” Emmy looked at Jasper. He frowned. I assumed he didn’t want to spend a night away from her. I had to hide my laughter. “It’s okay. We will find a time that works. Maybe when things settle down.” “Okay…” Emmy caved as she leaned back. “Remember when you made this dent?” Emmy rubbed a dent

in the porch under the swing. “Ha, yeah!” “So s tupid” Colt sighed and shook his head. “What happened?” Jasper asked. “Being the princess that she is, was wearing a dress. A nn made her wear it. It was so ugly that we brought out a sewing machine and fixed it. However, it was so long that she stepped on it and fell over. Buttered her chin.” “Truly was an awful dress.” The front door opened and Brian and Marc came out. “That didn’t go well.” Marc sighed. “We will all need to be on high alert moving forward.” Dad was trying to control his anger “A nn is back “Colt stated. “Yeah, she is pi ssed.” “Is Kris safe here from An n?” Colt asked. “Why do you ask that?” Dad looked confused. “Maybe it’s best if she stays with Emmy this week. Not to put a target of your back from Darin, but at least she won’t get retaliation from An n.”






###Chapter 043

My haw dropped. “Wh–”

“That would keep her close to Alec if he is her mate.” Marc stated.

“Mate or not, I’ll die protecting what is right.” Alec vowed.

“Please, Ice? Stay with me?” Everyone looked at me.

“I won’t force you but I do believe that will be best.” Dad looked at me in the eye.

“We would be happy to have you.” Marc smiled at me.

“Guess I’ll go pack.” I said slightly moody as I got up and walked inside. I expected Emmy to follow me but I didn’t think Colt would let her. We made it to my bedroom before he spoke.

“I’m sorry I can’t protect you here.”

“I know you are.”

“Please use your manners.”

“Obviously, Colt.” Pulling out my black duffel, I grabbed everything I needed for the week.

“You can leave your dress. Dad has a whole day planned for you.”

“And you?”

“Yes but completely different type of day.” Colt smirked. He was leaning on the wall by the door.

“Do you think Alec is my mate?” I asked as I picked out my shoes. I kept it basic.

“Looking that way.”

“And Ace?”

“Ace needs to move on. What Alec said about the fight was right. Even if it was a low blow.”

“I’ve been dealt a shitty hand since day one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Jacob was my mate!”

“Ew, don’t say that.” Colt scrunched up his face.

“Man whore is going to catch something one day.”

“True. I’m serious though, Darin is bad news. He killed his own mate.”

“Here’s a thought, what if Alec isn’t my mate?”

“Then at least you get a change of scenery for a week.”

Colt was trying to make it better. “Maybe even help Emmy with adapting. Alec said it’s not going as well as they hoped.”

“What?” That surprised me. Stopping packing, I looked at him.

“Yeah, she has been forgetful. Alec thinks she is homesick.”

“It’s only been…”

“I know but change isn’t always easy.” Colt walked over to me. Putting his hands on my shoulders, he looked me in the eye. “I truly believe this will be good for both you and Emmy. Please try and have a good week.”

“For you, I will.”

“Maybe something good will come from this.” Colt grabbed my bag and pulled me towards the door.

“You were always the positive one.”

“I’m usually right.”

“Why aren’t you more concerned about your mate?”

“I’m more worried about you. I’m nervous for sure but I know my path in life.”

“Damn first born.” I tried to joke.

“I did get the better looks and body.” I had to roll my eyes at Colt. He shook his hips as we walked out the front door. Handing my bag to Alec, Colt gave me a big hug.

“See you tomorrow at school, sis.”

I hugged him back like my life depended on it. “I love you.” I said in the mind-link.noveldrama

“Can’t say it out loud?” Colt responded as I gave dad a hug.

“I have an image to uphold. People can’t know I’m soft on the inside.”

“Ready?” Alpha Marc asked.

“Yes, sir.” Alec already headed to put my bag in the trunk.

Giving one last look to my dad and brother, Emmy grabbed my hand and pulled me along. “I love you TOO Ice!”

I tried to glare but I couldn’t fight the smile that forced my lips to move upward. Alec opened the back door for me. Emmy sat in the middle with Jasper on her other side. Alec and Alpha Marc were in the front. Alec was driving so his rearview mirror was pointed at me.

“We usually have supper at seven as a family. You are invited to join us this week.” Alpha Marc looked back at me.

“Thank you, sir. That would be appreciated.” I gave him a polite smile.

“Alec will show you where you will be staying and give you a tour of the house.” It dawned on me that Angela will be there.

“Th-thank you.” I hesitated when I realized this.

“Something wrong?” Alpha Marc asked.

My eyes met his as I struggled with my words. “I have a personal rule that I refuse to lie. Although the truth to my hesitation is juvenile, I rather not bore you with teenage drama.”







###Chapter 44

Chapter 0044 “Your talking about Angela, aren’t you?” Alec stated as his dad was working out what I meant. “Yes.” I said bluntly as I looked at Alec in the mirror. “I do not wish to bring drama to your home.” “This will be fun.” Marc laughed. “In my pack, it’s and eye for an eye. Interesting. “Oh.” “Within reason but I will see Angela is busy this week.” Marc turned back around. “It will be great having you here.” Emmy said. After what Colt said, I really looked at her. Her eyes were slightly sunken, she had lost weight and her spark was gone. “I think we need to have a conversation, Emily.’ She just nodded in response as her eyes fell. Jasper put his arms around her and held her close. “She is very overwhelmed.” “That’s okay. Let me help you figure things out. Let’s stay home tomorrow and we can spend the day focusing on you.” “If I’d know that’s all it would take for you to agree to stay home, I would have said this an hour ago Jasper muttered “Seems you have a lot to learn about woman.” I joked with him.

“S hit.” Jasper tried puffing up his chest. “Did you bring your work? I can help you too?” Emmy asked “I finished it all.” “All of it?” “Yes. Literally everything. Unless my assistants have a problem, it’s all done.” “You have assistants?” Alpha Marc asked. Looking over at Alec, he struggled. He kept some of what I told him to himself. “Yes, sir. I am the head organizer to all school functions. Well, that is until I graduate.” “All? For the last four years, it has been you?” He turned and looked at me “Yes.” noveldrama

They have never said your name. Alpha Marc stated. “Correct. That was one of the terms for me doing it. I didn’t want any recognition. I didn’t do it for the notary.” 1 “Why did you do it?” Jasper asked. “Keep me busy and away from An n “I shrugged. “That was a great slap.” Jasper laughed. “Which reminds me, can I join the warriors training this week?” I asked Alpha Marc. “Kris, they don’t allow ranking women to fight.” Emmy said to me. “What?” My ha w dropped as I looked at Alec. job to protect them.” Jasper groaned. “They are needed to help make the pack function. It’s our job to I looked at Jasper. “She is the daughter of a top warrior. She has been training her whole life. You mean to tell me that you have taken away one of the most important things in her life and you sit there worried why she isn’t adapting to your pack?” “Kris, it’s fine.” Emmy tried to play the peace maker. “It’s not fine. Alpha Marc said an eye for an eye. If you can’t make Emmy submit, she trains.” I folded arms and looked at Jasper. “Little help, Alec?” “Kris has a point, make Emmy submit.” I nodded in appreciation for the back up. It made me smile. “Fine, we will battle. “There was smile on Emmys face she was trying to hide. I sat back was looked out the window. We pulled up to the pack house and no one was around. It was strange but it didn’t question it. The guys bag seemed to not be bothered by it. Jasper, Emmy and Marc all went inside as Alec grabbed my “Did I just pis s off Jasper?” “Yes but dad and I both have been trying to get him to agree to let her fight. Or at least train. That isn’t

a pack rule but a rule Jasper made up so he could keep her safe after the car wreck we had.” “Emmy doesn’t need protection. I’m looking forward to see him figure that out. No wonder she is struggling.” Alec opened the front door. “Dinning room down that hall. Since it’s 6:30. I’ll show you to your room and then we can walk around to see everything and go straight to supper.” “Am I dressed appropriately?” “We don’t have a dress code.” Alec said as we started up the stairs.

###Chapter 45

Chapter 0045 The pack house massive but had an older feel to it. Built with natural stones, it looked natural and beautiful. I was drawn to it. The aged wooden floors had been restained recently. The smell still lingered in the air the further you went into the house. Warm tones of browns, creams and whites perfectly accented each other. Not a single cobweb hung in the corner of the rooms, telling me his staff was very disciplined. Most places, you could find a web or two. A massive chandelier hung over the foyer but it was of wooden beads that draped down. The whole place gave off a vibe that said we have money but don’t flaunt it. “The top floor is reserved for the alphas family and certain guest. You will be staying up there. My room is here. You will be right across the hall. Dad and mom’s room is down the hall a ways with a few more guest rooms.” Alec opened the door to my room. It was decorated in creams and grays. Very neutral. Still very nice but basic. A guest room. Alec set my stuff on the bed as I looked around. It was smaller with a seating area but not exactly a livingroom. “Second floor is the beta and gam ma families and bottom floor is strictly guest. No one else lives in the

pack house.” “Why am I up here?” “So I can make sure you are safe.” “Maybe we should fight too and see who makes who submit.” I muttered as I walked past Alec. Alec grabbed my hand and pulled me against his chest. My mouth went dry as his hand wrapped around my waist. “When I make you submit, there won’t be an audience.” “I think you got that mixed up. It will be me on top “I left the double meaning swim in his head. His eyes darkened as I took a step away right as there was a knock on the door. I kept walking backwards as Alec reined himself in. “Hey.” It was Jasper and Emmy.

“Figured we would join you guys” Emmy looked between Alec and I. “Diiiiid we interrupt?” “No, Alec was just learning something about me. Let’s keep this tour going.” Jasper was trying not to smile as Alec playfully punched his shoulder. Emmy looked her arm in mine as we walked. 2 “Hold up.” Alec muttered. We stopped in front of an elegant door. “This is my personal private library. You may use it.” Alec opened the door and my mouth dropped. It was beautiful. Floor to ceiling book shelves. Only there was one wall untouched. “I’m still collecting “A balcony sat directly across from it with two “This is amazing.” I started looking through the shelves. Most I have read, some I hadn’t had the chance and some I’ve never heard of.. “Let’s keep going or we won’t finish.” Emmy said, quietly. She was pulling me along as she knew I wouldn’t leave. “Pulling my eyes “Okay…” Pulling my eyes away, I followed them down the stairs. “Down this hall to the right under the stairs, there is a game room, workout room and office space.” Opening each door, I had a chance to look at it all. “The teenagers like to come here, hangout and eat before going home for the night. It’s a place to relax after training or just in general.” Jasper stated “Sounds fun.” “Can be or it can be a headache if we have to break up a fight.” Alec had his arms folded over his chest. “Locker rooms are through the training room.” Emmy filled in. “Better head to the kitchen.” Alec looked at his phone. The dinning room had large double doors. There was a few massive tables that filled the room. “Th a more intimate dinning area but this is where we will be tonight.” “Okay.” I said simply as Alec showed me to my seat.noveldrama

“This is my mother, Luna Erin. Dad’s beta and Jaspers dad, Andrew and mom, Susan. Then gam ma Judd and his mate Donna. Not sure if you have met my gam ma Kevin and his sister Olivia.” Alec went down the line.







###Chapter 46

Chapter 0046 “This is Kristen Jeffreys, Alpha Brian’s daughter. She will be staying with us this week” “Nice to meet you, Kristen.” Luna Erin spoke first. “She goes by Kris.” Alec told his mother. “Whatever you wish to call me is fine. It is nice to meet you. You have a beautiful house.” I “Kris is just fine! Thank you. I hear you are a busy gal with all the activities you put on.” Luna Erin kept the conversation going as the food got brought out. “Yes ma’am. I am in charge of all the events the school puts on. Until I graduate anyway.” “Why have I not seen your name on the list?” “It was part of the agreement that I remain anonymous from those. I do it to help the teachers out, help the kids that need the extra hand up on their college applications and because I enjoy being busy.” “All that and a tattoo shop?” Beta Susan asked.

“I hope I will be able to continue my business after school. It’s more than a hobby to me.” “Well, I think that’s lovely.” Luna Erin stopped the interrogation. “You will be 18 this Friday. I’m excited for your birthday party!” Gam ma Donna smiled warmly at me. “It will definitely be an event he bit into a green bean. to remember.” I said politely. Alec raised his eyebrows at that comment as The conversation tapered off and left me to be able to sit quietly and try to eat. The food tasted amazing. Some sort of Asian meatball over rice with roasted green beans. There was a hot sauce on it that intrigued me. However, I wasn’t that hungry. I tried to eat as much as I could to be polite but I was only able to eat half of it. The waitress came around and gathered our plates. I saw Alec frown at mine but thankfully he didn’t comment. “Dad, if you don’t mind, I think we will s kip the nightcap and let Emmy get Kris situated.”

“That’s okay.” I was so relieved by this. Kevin, Jasper, Emmy, Alec and myself all stood up. “Thank you so much for dinner and allowing me to stay here this week. If there is anything I can do to help. out, please let me know.” “The pleasure is ours, dear.” Luna Erin smiled at me before we turned to leave. “Kiss as s.” Kevin muttered to me as soon as we were out the door. Playfully, I gave him a punch in the arm. “Maybe you should take notes on manners?” I smirked at him rubbing his arm. “Don’t want to pis s off the princess here. She will put you down!” Jasper joined in. “So I’ve heard. I’m more anxious to hear what you have planned for Angela.” Kevin ran up the stairs faster than we did. “Oh! Me too!” Emmy squealed. “Nothing anymore. If I’m staying here, I will not disrespect a pack member.” We went into Alec’s room, I was much bigger with reds and blacks. Very muscular decor and very much Alec. I watched as everyone took a seat on the couch or arm chair. Leaving me another chair. “Come on. An eye for an eye. Alpha Marc won’t get mad.” Jasper stated. He completely relaxed into Emmy as she wrapped her arms around him. “Movie?” Kevin asked as he stood up and looked through Alec’s stash. “Sure.” Emmy called out It’s been a hell of a day but I would try to power through. “Action or horror.” I said “What the lady wants, the lady gets.” Kevin pulled out a Transformers movie and puts it in. Emmy toss me a blanket before grabbing one herself. “What is it with woman and blankets?” Kevin asked. 1 assume you are mate less?” I looked at him. Kevin almost looked offended. “So?” noveldrama

“Only a single man would ask such s tupid questions” Jasper sighed. *What he said” smirking, I caught Alec watching me. He was the quiet type, just watching. As I cuddled up with my blanket, I turned sideways so I was comfortable.






###Chapter 47

Chapter 0047 I think I made it five minutes before my eyes closed. Is she sleeping already?” I heard Kevin asked. “It’s been a hard day for her.” Alec muttered. “Emmy is asleep too “Jasper whispered. “What is the f ucking plan, dude? This is not just any chick you brought home.” Kevin rounded on Alec. “I know that. I’m convinced she is my mate. I couldn’t leave her there.” “So you brought the danger here? I heard about Darin. He is ruthless and will mark her against her will the moment she turns 18.” “I know that! Colt and I have been talking. He is extremely protective of her. He won’t tell me fully why but she has been the attention of Alphas for years.”

“Emmy said it was because of how smart she is. She can see patterns and would be a death sentence to any enemies. Why do you think her dad has got to the point he has. Yes, he is ruthless and will kill on sight but she is his secret weapon.” “That’s not why we are protecting her. Brains or not, she is our allies and we will honor the agreemen Alec stated firmly. “Not because you want to f uck her.” Kevin muttered. “She is strictly business.” Not sure why that stung but it did. “That’s a lie and you know it. I seen the way you look at her. If you truly believe she is your mate, this is personal.” Jasper called him out. “I’m trying to keep my distance in the off chance I’m wrong,” “For what it’s worth, even without the brains, she would be perfect for you. She has Luna material all over her.” Kevin whispered a little loud.

“Shh. I know that. I’d be proud to show her off. However, the moment we know, Darin will challenge me.” “Thankfully it’s not till death but that is the extremely serious.” Kevin muttered. “I know. I’ll be spending the week preparing, just in case. Jasper, you are going to have to make sure she is ready to fight Angela on Saturday.” “You can’t train her?” Jasper asked. Til watch but I don’t think I’ll be able to do what will be needed.” “You honestly think of her as your mate already, don’t you?” Kevin asked. The was a pause. “Just got to bed. I’ll see you guys tomorrow. I’ll stay home tomorrow with the girls.” Alec dismissed them. “Need help with her?” Kevin asked. “Just leave.” Alec said. I heard Jasper scoop Emmy up and the three of them left. I half expected to feel Alec lift me us but after cussing, he went to what assumed was the bathroom and shut the door. When I heard the shower turn on, I quietly got up and went to my room. I had just got into my silk shorts and tank when my bedroom door flew open. “you could have told me your woke up.” “It’s just business right?” I asked as I moved my stuff to the chair. His b*dy froze as he realized I heard it all. “Listen.” I said as I walked up to him. “Care about me or don’t care about me but don’t f ucking have pity on me. I am capable of taking Darin down myself. The only person to ever beat me was my dad. Not even Colt. I’m not a princess, I’m a sarcastic bi tchy girl who was raised as a man with manners. I don’t n be coddled or treated as if I’m helpless. I don’t want a mate that is going to try to keep me from bein I’m not Emmy. I won’t lay down and take it. I-” Then Alec grabbed me.

###Chapter 48

Chapter 0048 Alec’s mouth was against mine in seconds as he stopped me up and pinned me against the wall. His d ick was firmly pressed up against my as I soaked my panties. The S**ual tension was building as Alec painfully but pleasurably massaging my breast. Our tongues fought for dominance as his grinded against me. I wanted this just as much as he did. The more he touched me, the more I accepted he could be my mate. My b*dy responded to his. Begged for his touch. I was losing my internal battle. A moan escaped my l*ps as Alec ripped open my shirt. Buttons flew everywhere as his mouth closed around my nipples. I had never went this far. My anxiety and self conscious peaked as he assaulted me. “You are so go d-dam n f ucking s exy as hell.” Alec muttered. Words were not coming to my mouth as I watched my nipple, bite and caress my t its. They were the perfect size to fill his hand. Like they were made for him. noveldrama

My head was telling me to stop but my heart and b*dy wanted… Needed more. Alec came up and looked at me. “I promise not to f uck you yet but allow me to satisfy you.” My b*dy started shaking under his. “…” “Have you never done this?” All I could do was shake my head, I deep growl radiated up his chest as he carried me to the bed. Laying down, he got on top of me. My breathing was heavy as he k*ssed my neck. “You’re shaking.” He looked up at me. His hand cupped my face. “Do you want me to stop?” Yes… No… What did I want? He shifted a little, causing his d ick to rub a sensitive spot between my legs. No.” “I’ll stop if you want. Just tell me. I won’t take your virginity tonight. I’ll save that for when we mark.”

That sent shivers down my spine. “Feel how your b*dy responds to me. See how it leaves goosebumps where ever I touch? This is why I think we are mates. I can’t get you out of my head. You are like a drug.” His l*ps wrapped around my nipples again as my back arched off the bed. My hands wrapped around him, feeling every muscle bulge in his torso. There wasn’t an ouch of fat on this man. His mouth covered mine as he shifted his b*dy off of mine. My legs instantly closed but his hand softly opened them back up. He didn’t stop k*ssing me as he moved my shorts to the side, cupping my soaked panties. Freeing my mouth, he kept his forehead against mine. “So wet for me.” He lifted his head up and stared into my eyes as one figure curled around my panties and sl*pped between my folds. My breathing was Faster his finger massaged my c lit. Giving me a new feeling that causes my eyes to roll back in my head. “Look at me.” He said in the softest voice. Obeying, I found his were full of passion, concern and desire. Tell me to stop.” He said before his finger hovered over my entrance. After a second, my hand cupped his face and pulled him down to me. Pushing my breast into him as his finger penetrated me. My whole b*dy tensed as he moved in and out before adding another finger “So f ucking tight.” I could tell the restraint he was having as he moved slowly but I needed more. “Oh, Alec.” I moaned. He looked at me. “Faster!” 唱 He didn’t need telling twice as his hand became a jackhammer in me. My back arched as the pressure built up in me. “Oh f uck!” I moaned. “Say my name!” Alec demanded as he attacked my ti ts. “ALEC!” I screamed as my or gasm hit. My b*dy clenched around him as I felt his b*dy shudder on top

of me. Only after I came down from my high, did Alec pull out. Sl*pping one arm under my neck, he rolled me towards him. Putting one of my legs through his, I felt a wet spot on his shorts. Alec pulled me to hir he stroked my hair. My face was buried in his chest







###Chapter 49

Chapter 0049 “Are you okay?” He asked me. “Yes.” I muttered as my b*dy gave one last shiver before calming down. My breathing started to level out as my eyes closed. “Sleep.” His hand continued to rub my back as I quickly fell asleep. It was the most peaceful night I have ever gotten. The next morning, I was alone. It was still dark out but I was cold. The clock read 5:14am. Deciding I needed a workout, I got up. Not wanting to smell like S**, I took a quick shower to rinse off before putting my hair in a messy bun. Grabbing a sports bra, tank and shorts, I was just about ready. My phone didn’t have any messages on it, so I sl*pped that in the phone holder of my waist band, with headphones and put my shoes on. The hallway was dark, everything was quiet as I slowly made my way to the training room. Thankfully, it was empty. Getting in a treadmill, I was able to sl*p my earphone on and start my warmup jog. I was half of the way through when there was movement beside me. Glancing over, a very muscular guy nodded and got on beside me and started running. Soon, the place was filling up. Getting off the treadmill, I grabbed two 25lbs dumbbells and started doin,

arms. “Sure you can handle that?” A coc k y looking guy came up to me. He looked around 18 but the p layboy type. “I think I’ll be okay.” I said as I removed one earphone so I could hear “Need a spotter?” “For what? Curls? Not sure you would be any help.”

The room stopped what they were doing and watched the exchange between the new girl and whoever this was. “The name is Calvin. What’s your’s beautiful?” “Kris.” I said as I kept going on my set. “Maybe you should try something lighter. Like this.” He picked up a ten pound weight and held it out to me “That seems to be more of your side. Though, it looks like you need more legs than arms.” I smirked at his obvious embarrassment. “I don’t take kindly to disrespect.” He told a step back. “Seems like this new girl needs to learn her place!” I was in the mood for a fight. “Sure. Lets see if you are man enough to take me on,” Standing up, I pulled out my headphone, placed my phone down and walked to the mat. Every one had gathered around to watch. Calvin was an inexperienced fighter. His stance was wrong, too jittery. He made the first move as he lunged, I went low and knocked his feet out from under him. To his credit, he caught himself and stood back up quickly. Then he went low, I allowed him to get his arms around me so I would elbow him in the kidney. His b*dy had a temporary lapse that I took advantage of. Wrapping my legs around his neck, I had one of his arms in a submission hold. There was so much cheering that I almost missed Alec’s voice. “The f uck is going on here?” He h front of him. “Kristen, let him go.” Everyone instantly backed away as he looked at the scene in Calvin gasped for air as he struggled to stand. “Hey!” I said with a smile. “Who can tell me what happened?” Alec folded his arms. noveldrama

“Calvin started it. He did his usual flirty advances then disrespected Kris by saying she needed ten pound weights instead of the 25. So, she poked fun at his chicken legs and here we are.” A girl stepped forward and gave a basic rundown. “I see, is this true, Calvin?” “I was just playing around.” “Did you not read the memo that was sent out?” Alec sighed “No.. Alpha.” “Obviously, or you would have know that this is Kristen Jeffreys. Daughter of Alpha Brian of the Blue Fang Pack.” Calvin’s eyes widened as he looked at me. “Nice to meet you. You need a lot of work on your form.” “Calvin, you’re on graveyard shift. Twenty laps, go. The rest of you back to your workout. Kris, just follow me.” Grabbing my phone, I ran after him.








###Chapter 50

Chapter 0050 “Why so cranky this morning?” I asked as we turned the corner. Alec looked around before he pushed me into the wall. “I am the only one who gets to touch his b*dy. His hand wrapped around my waist as he growled in my ear. An involuntary moan escaped my open l*ps into his ear. “I’m not going to stop fighting. It wasn’t S**ual, it was fighting. However, he needs to be taught some manners.” There was footsteps so Alec backed away. “Come on.” He growled as Emmy and Jasper walked around. the corner. “What’s going on here?” Emmy asked. “Alec woke up on the wrong side of the bed, apparently.” Alec rolled his eyes at my inside jab. “Okay…” Jasper looked at Alec strangely. “Come on. I need a shower and then we can get breakfast and focus on you all day!” I said as I grabbed her hand and took off running up the stairs. “Someone is in a good mood this moming.” Emmy laughed as she sat on the couch, turning the T.V., “Slept good!” I yelled as I got In the shower. There was some soreness between my legs but otherwise.

felt great. As soon as I was done, I was able to get dressed in athletic shorts and a t-shirt. Nothing fancy but I blowdried and styled my hair. After applying some makeup, I was ready. “Wow, all the effort for just me today?” Emmy joked as she stood up. “Just am feeling good today.” “That doesn’t have to do with a certain someone?” “More the change of scenery” but yes! It had everything to do with a certain someone. We headed out to the kitchen where only Jasper and Alec had beaten us. I sat by Alec and Emmy took her spot by Jasper. Food was lined on the side, Buffett style.

“Help y ladies.” Jasper nodded towards the food. “Perfect!” Emmy squealed as I followed her. There was a variety of foods, sausage, bacon, waffles, pancakes and even biscuits and gravy. There was and water. Adding some milk and Suger to it, I was satisfied. “Found what you wanted?” Emmy came up to me and asked. “1 di-” turning, I saw a group of girls had sat down by the guys. Disappointed, I just shrugged and moved to the end of the table, Emmy followed. “I could have pushed it away…” “You can if you want to sit next to Jasper.” I shrugged. Emmy looked over at them and sighed before she sat down across from me. “Are you really going to help me?” Emmy whispered “Yes. I want you to be successful, you are so great with me. Not sure why you are having trouble here.” “Jasper wants me to do it his way, not how I think it should be done. We have butter heads.” “It’s hard letting someone else take over and letting them do it their way.” I said as I took a bite of my malt -o-meal “How do you eat such a thing?” Emmy scowled at my choice. “Because it’s amazing.” I laughed. “Are you sure you are wearing that red dress?” “F uck yes !!” Emmy cheered as we laughed. “I’m so excited to see her face. It will be awesome.” “Me too! Let me put stones in your hair!” “Deal!” “YES!!” She pumped her arm down. noveldrama

“Just not like last time. I looked like a da mn rhinestones frog.” Emmy broke out into a fit of laughter. We were both crying by the time the guys walked up to us. “What is so funny?” Jasper asked. “Emmys ability to decorate a frog. Are you guys done with your conversation?” I asked as I dried my eyes. “Why didn’t you come back and sit with us?” Jasper almost sounded hurt. You really surrounded by gifs and not even paying attention to where we were Figured it was portant. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading?







###Chapter 51

Chapter 0051 “You weren’t jealous?” Jasper asked Emmy. “I mean, I didn’t like it but you are the beta and have to run the pack. The responsibility comes with talking to girls. I know I could have said something and you would have made room for me.” “What she said.” I said as I looked at Alec. “I got to go to school. Come tell me goodbye.” Jasper tickled Emmy as they ran off before he slapped her noveldrama

on the as s. “I’m glad she is happy here.” “She hasn’t once smiled or laughed like that.” “Really?” “Yeah.” “I could tell you why.” I said as I gathered our trays and carried them to the drop off window. “Why?” “Jasper needs to allow her to do things her way. Not his mother’s way. She is good and all he is doing is belittling her talents. She doesn’t feel heard.” “She told you that?” Alec asked as we made our way to his office. “I can see it in her” He opened his office door for me. I sat on his couch on one said and he took the other. “You weren’t jealous?” 1 “First off, you didn’t exactly look for me. Second, we aren’t mates yet so I’m just so random girl and is claiming a seat next to you. Not cool. People will think we are a couple. You said I was a business transaction.”

Alec glared at me. “That was for Cash’s benefit. You should know differently.” “Well, I’ll wait till you parade me around.” “The ice princess wants a parade?” Alec chuckled. “No, just to be accepted and wanted.”







###Chapter 52

Chapter 0052 “That’s dramatic.” Emmy sighed. “It’s not. Emmy. If that information gets in the wrong hands, they could organize an attack on this pack. That would kill people. As beta female, your job is still to protect the pack with your life. This is what it means to me a ranking wolf.” “You grew up knowing you would lay down your life for a pack member?” “So did your dad. He was a top warrior. Yes, we were trained but we never saw battle. Now you are a ranking wolf, you have to take this seriously.” “Oh wow. Now I understand why you want to travel!”

“Emmy. That’s not why I want to travel. I wanted to get away from An n. I wanted to get away from having to constantly watching over my back. Living on eggshells. I absolutely love being a ranking wolf. I get to help people. Colt and I opened that bar so our pack would have jobs. When someone comes to you and thanks you for helping them, it’s the most rewarding thing. You will find what you like here. Where you want to help. Once you find what your passionate about, all this will be worth it.” “Thank you. I already feel so much better.” Emmy had tears in her eyes want “I know you will be a great beta female. Your heart is pure gold and when you figure out where you w to put that focus, it will be worth it.” “You’re right. I just need to keep pushing on.” Emmy gathered her stuff. “I’m going to go put this away and I’ll bring up lunch.” “Thank you.” I said as I watched her leave. As soon as she was gone, I started cleaning up my mess. “You’re a natural.” Alec started. “One of my many talents.” I shrugged.

Grabbing my phone, I called the answer machine at the shop. I only had one tattoo that was going to last three hours. He canceled due to his grandmother dying. “What’s wrong?” Alec noticed my change “My pack member canceled his appointment due to his grandma dying. I wish I could take him something. Maybe I can get Colt to do it.” “I’ll take you and then you can do my tattoo that needs to get finished Ηnoveldrama







###Chapter 53

Chapter 0053 “What’s up?” Colt asked as I got out of the car. “Frankie canceled his appointment because of his grandma. Figured I’d come give him a basket.” “I thought so, so I brought one up for you.” Colt handed me the basket. “Alec.” Colt shook Alec’s hand. I “An n is in a frenzy so as much as I want to see you, you better get going” “Noted. Thanks Colt!” The boys nodded as we got back in the car. Giving Alec directions, we were able to make it to Frankie’s house easily. There was a fair amount of people there. “If you don’t want to come, I understand.” I said to Alec as I got out. “I’ll wait for you outside “Alec leaned up against his car as I walked inside the house. “Kirs! You didn’t have to come! I’m so sorry.” Frankie was a mess. “Don’t be sorry.” Sitting the basket down on the table with the other cards, I was pulled into a conversation. noveldrama

It took me 15 minutes to break free. As I walked outside, I saw Alec checking his watch. “Kris?” A small voice sounded behind me. It was Frankie’s daughter. She was three years old. Kneeling down, she ran towards me. Hugging me with everything she had in her. “Oh Isabelle. You will see her again.” I tried to comfort her. Sally, Frankie’s mate came out to get her. “Mamma!” Isabelle cried. “I’m sorry, she has been a mess.” “Are you going to plant a flower?” I asked “Yes.” “Isabelle? Maybe you help mommy and daddy pick out a flower to your grandma.” Isabella sniffed but nodded.”Otay.”

“Thank you.” Sally said as I waved good ye and she went inside. 1 Alec just held the door open for me as I got in. A second later, he was doing the same. “Sorry that took longer than I expected.” “It’s okay.” It was me this time that reached out and took his hand. He accepted it without a fight. Sending butterflies to my stomach. Waving as we passed the guards, we drove with the windows down to my shop. The wind felt great in my hair. Pulling up to the front, there was storm clouds in the distance. “Are we suppose to get rain?” “I didn’t think until later Alec mumbled as he looked on. Unlocking my door, I relocked it after Alec walked in. Setting my stuff down, I started pulling out everything I needed. “Assuming you have a pain tolerance, we can get in done tonight but we can stop if needed.” “S hit.” Alec took his shirt off and sat down so his back was facing out. “This is cold.” Spraying his back, I started cleaning it up. There was a few scratches on his shoulders that made me chuckle. 1 “What?” “I told your not to let any girls scratch your back.” Alec turned and looked at me. “You going to charge me for what you did?” “Maybe… But not in money.” I flirted as I pushed him back around. “What would the princess want then?” Turning my gun on, I started working. “Hmm, any suggestions?” “I don’t know what you want. A date? Back rub?” “Hmm, I was thinking something more… Exciting.” “Oh? Like what?” “A midnight bike ride.” “I think I could handle that. Let me get it figured out.” Alec agreed more easily than I figured he would.

“Really? Perfect.” “Did you think I was going to say no?”







###Chapter 54

Chapter 0054 “I’m going to prove to you that is just what I am going to do.” It took me a second to respond. “Oh?” “Do you not think you are worthy of that?” Alec asked, “It’s not that, it’s I have all these hopes and dreams and as much as I try and be a good person, will they come true?” “What are your hopes and dreams?” “Ask me again on Friday.” I teased as this was getting too personal. “What do you plan on wearing?” “A tux. Maybe with a red tie.” “Not a bad choice.” I approved. “Okay. I need you to lay down now.” Alec stood up and I adjusted the chair. He laid down and I had to fight the memories away from last night. “Alec?” “Yes…?”

“Why were you grumpy this morning?” “I spent the night with you only to see you with your legs around another guys head. Why do you think?” “So you didn’t regret the night?” Alec looked up at me. “Don’t ever question that again. I’ll never regret the moments we spend together.” His eyes looked pis sed I even asked. “Okay.” Alec put his head down so I could continue. Alec placed his hand on my thigh as I kept working. His thumb rubbed the inner part. “I didn’t realize how sensitive you were.” “1. Am not. Sensitive.” The audacity. “You are even though you hide it well.” noveldrama

“If I hide it so well, how would you know?” “The vulnerability you showed me last night plus the tid bits you say, you don’t show that easily. The fact. you can’t even tell Emmy you love her.” “Yeah… Well… You cam in your shorts.” It was a lame comeback “First time for everything.” Alec sighed. “When did you leave my bed to go back to yours?” “Oh, 4:30 or so. I wanted to get a run in, I just got back when I heard the cheering from outside.” “Ah.” “How did you sleep?” “Really good. Best night of sleep I had ever gotten.” “You’re welcome.” Alec muttered. “Pretty sure it was because of the mattress.” I teased him. A deep grown ran up his b*dy. “Is that so?” “I guess you will have to try harder next time.” A sly smile erupted on my face as I looked into Alec’s eyes. His hand moved to my inner tight as his finger sl*pped between my panties. His other hand moved my chair so he could access it getter. Picking me up, Alec shifted my hips forward. All the while laying on his stomach. All he could do was play with my cl it. “Go, on. Finished my tattoo.” Alec pitched down a little making me jump. Doing as he asked, I tried to focus but it was hard. His finger would speed up and slow down. My breathing was labored. It took almost four hours to complete his tattoo as I would reach the breaking point and he would expertly slow down, causing me to whimper. “There. All done.” I said in a shaky voice. Alec’s phone started ringing. With one hand, he answered it. “Hello?” Pause. Alec refused to let me go. “She is finishin “She is finishing up my tattoo. We will be there shortly.” Click.

“I’m done.” I repeated. “Want to go look at it?” It was hard to talk. “Let’s go “Alec stood up without removing his hand. Somehow, he switched hands so his other hand went down my shorts. He stood up and made me stand up and walked to the mirror. Taking the original on to him as my legs were giving out. Alec moved my leg to the side as he sl*pped three fingers inside me as I stood and wanted him finger f uck me. “Oh!” “What was that?” Alec whispered in my ear. He found that spot and bared see down as his hand squeezed my t its. His di ck was har against my back.







###Chapter 55

Chapter 0055 Something sparked in me as I thought two can be play this game. Reaching around, I sl*pped my hand under his shorts. Grabbed his d ick, I started stroking it. “You are playing with fire.” Alec warned “I’m ready.” I said. “Not yet.” Alec pulled his hand out of me and yanked my shorts down to my ankles. I was so focused on those that I wasn’t prepared to stop him from taking my shirt and bra off. In seconds, I was standing in front of him, as s n*ked. Pulling me down, Alec moved my legs up and out so I had a full view of myself, “watch me f uck you.” He growled in my ear. My eyes stayed glued to his fingers that moved around me so perfectly. My hands grabbed his shorts for support and because I couldn’t grab his neck. “Oh! Oh! Oh!” As soon as I about climaxed, Alec removed his fingers. I noveldrama

“What was that?” He teased. My face was flushed, tingly as I couldn’t speak. “Please?” I begged. Alec whipped me around before putting his face between my legs. My hips buckled as he got to work. Riding his face, my hand kept him there. “Oh, Alec. Please!” His fingers came back as he sucked my c lit. Finally, I was permitted to org asm. His b*dy shook to as I laid there, spread for him to see. 1 Groaning, Alec moved over me. “You okay, hun?” Hun? No one has ever called me a pet name. “Yup. See,… totally… unaffected.” I said between breaths. “Yeah, okay. Probably shower before we head back.” “Okay.” I said but didn’t move. “Come on. Jasper is waiting on you to train.”

“You literally sucked me dry and expect me to train?” I said skeptical. Alec broke down laughing. “Yes, I do.” He pulled me to my feet and pushed me in the bathroom. “I’ll clean this up, you clean that up. “You caused all of this” I said as he closed the door. Rinsing off in the shower, I put back on my clothes. I’d need to change anyway to fight. When I got back out there, Alec literally had everything cleaned up and in the sterilizer. “How…?” “I watched you do it. It wasn’t hard. Come on.” Alec pushed towards the door and turned the lights off. “Wait.” He said right as I was about to unlock the door. Turning me around, he planted the most gentle k*ss to my l*ps. “Good luck on training.” “Hmm, maybe I should train more if that’s what you are going to do before hand.” I muttered as I unlocked the door. “I would rather you not.” Alec rolled his eyes. Right as he was about to unlock his door, screeching tires came around the corner. “Get down!” Alec threw himself on me as bullets peppered his car. Thankfully they didn’t stay around and sped off. “You okay?” I asked as I looked at the vehicle. “Yeah, I’m good.” Alec stood up and pulled me with him. “We need to go.” I said. Alec got in his car to see if it would start. It did, I was barely in the car as he floored it. “Call your dad and have him meet us at my pack.” Alec sounded like a different person. Se xy yet so scary. I didn’t hesitate to pull my phone out of my purse and dial dad’s emergency line. “Kris? What happened?” “Get Colt and get to Alpha Marcs place. Alec and I were just shot at!” “Are you hurt?”

“No, Alec saved me.” That’s when I noticed how pale Alec was. “Alec? Were you shot?” His eyes started to closed. “DAD!” I screamed as Alec’s car ran off the road and into a tree. The world went black for a second before my adrenaline kicked in. I was thrown from the car. After a quick exam, nothing was broken. Alec’s head was against the air bag.








###Chapter 56

Chapter 0056 “Alec!” The car was against a tree and I landed on the hood. Sliding off, my legs protested but I ignore it. Whoever shot at us might come back. I needed to get Alec out of here. After three tries, I was able to get the door open. Blood was running down Alecs arm. Ripping off my shirt, I used it as a turaquette to stop the bleeding. Grabbing a stick, I was able to tighten if correctly before. using a hair tie to fasten it. Feeling in his pockets. I found his phone. I had to push him back so the face ID would recognize him. Thankfully, it worked and I called his dad. “Alec.” “It’s Kris. We were leaving the tattoo shop and someone drove by and shot at us. Alec was hit on the shoulder. We tried to drive away but he passed out and we crashed. We are just past the old bridge. Get here quick, I don’t know if they will come back.” “I’m coming!” “My dad was suppose to go to your house I was on the phone with him when we crashed. Call him, I don’t know where my phone is.” “Got it. Need anything?” “Alec needs a a doctor or he will be lose his arm.” I heard the sound of a speeding car. “S hit, I think they are noveldrama

back. Hurry.” I hung up and I put his phone in my bra. Slinging Alecs arm over my shoulder, I heaved him out of the car. Shifting positions, I did a modified fireman’s carry as I hid him in the brush. There was no way I was going to be about to take him far but I could by us time. I heard the car stop and three doors slam. “Come out and play!” I heard the sound of a gun being coc ked. As quietly as possible, I snuck around as I could attack from behind. One male stayed at the car as the

other two moved into the forest. I smelled their stench as I got closer, rogues. Still, this wasn’t random. Sneaking up, I jumped at the last minute, using my claw to slice his neck. Blood sprayed everywhere as I grabbed the gun from his grasp. “Stop right there, missy!” Slow, I looked up at the two rogues that stood in front of me. Their guns pointed at me. “No.” I pointed my gun at the first guy “No?” “If I’m going out, one of you are going with me.” I said stubbornly. “What do you want?” “You.” The second one said. “For who?” “Come with us and find out.” They started moving so one was behind me. This wasn’t good. No matter where I moved, they shifted. “I think not.” A large familiar growl echoed. Ace. That meant my dad. It all happened so quick. One gun went off, then mine. Ace fell behind me and something smashed into my chest. I fell back over Aces b*dy. It was as if time stood still. Colt’s face looked into mine as I watched two wolves tear into each rogue. “Alec…” I tried to point but my b*dy was being pulled around. “Get her to the hospital!” It was like I snapped out of it. “NO! Alec!” “Where’s my boy?” Marc came over to me. Jasper and Cash were behind him with Andrew and Judd. “I hid him, keep him safe” I had to fight to stay awake, “be-behind the log…” I pointed upward Marc ran to go look resting my head against Colt, I watched as they drug down a lifeless b*dy. “Take him first.” I said Marc. Jasper punched a tree as my focus was coming back. My chest hurt like a mother, Looking down, there

was blood. “Colt?” “You were shot, Ice.” Mrs. Smith Author Π Thanks for reading!







###Chapter 57

Chapter 0057 Pulling down my bra, I pulled out Alec’s phone. The bullet was impacted into it. There was already an impressive purple bruise forming. “I’m okay.” Resting my head against Colt, my eyes landed on the lifeless b*dy of Ace. “He saved me.” z “He loved you.” Colt wrapped his arms around me as silent tears ran down my face. “St upid fool! We had a plan!” Jacob was just as distraught as Jasper. “Your turn, miss.” Another ambulance showed up and helped me get into the back.” We are going to take her in to get all this glass removed.” “We will be there shortly.” Colt said as he looked back at Ace. “Jasper, need a ride to the hospital?” “Yes.” He jumped in and grabbed my hand. “Thank you for saving Alec.” Tears swelled in his eyes as the door shut and we started driving. I just felt numb. Ace lost his life and Alecs was barely hanging on. All because they wanted me. The EMTs started a line and put in a dose of antibiotics. They checked my head to make sure it w too terrible looking. “That looks okay.

“Yeah, the tree broke my fall.” I said sarcastically bit chy. “How long t long till we are there?” Jasper asked. “In thirty seconds.” Right on cue, it came to a stop and the doors opened. As they wheeled me in, I made eye contact with Marc. He ran over to me. “Is she okay?” “After we hung up, I put Alec’s phone in my bra. Here.” I handed it back to him. His fingers touched the bullet that was stuck in it. “Maybe you will be able to save it.”

Marc was silent before straightening up.” You saved Alec, I will forever be in your debt. I understand you lost one of your tonight.” “Ace. Yes.” More tears came down. “We need to take her back.” Marc stepped back and the gurney started moving again. Two hours later, they picked all the glass out and stitched up my forehead. Magically, no broken bones, just hematomas and deep bone bruising. Colt came in with a wheel chair. “Ready?” “I’m not leaving.” “I know, we are going to see Alec.” “Is he okay?” “He’s awake. Come on. He’s threatening to get up if he doesn’t see you.” That made me smile as I got in the wheel chair. Colt gave me his shirt since they cut my bra off. I still had my shorts though. We went down a few hallways before we heard yelling. “Alec calm down before they have to sedate you!” I heard Marcs voice. “Where is she?” He yelled. “Right here.” I said quietly. Everyone turned and looked at me. “You’re alive!” Alec tried to get out of bed but three pairs of hands were holding him down. Standing up, Colt helped me to his bedside. Alec scooter over so I could sit. His hand wrapped around me in a hug. “Are you okay?” “Your phone saved me.” I said. “What?” Alec asked. “Here.” Marc handed Alec’s phone back to me. Alec looked at the bullet. “What happened?” I realized dad walked in the room too.. “Kristen!” He came up to me and gave me a hug.

“Daddy!” “I heard the crash. I was so f ucking scared.” Dad dried his eyes. “We all did.” Colt stated. “You were on speaking phone. Jacob and A-ace.” “Frankie was my appointment tonight. His grandma died so Alec wanted to get his tattoo finished. So we we went there. After it was done, Jasper was suppose to train with me to get me ready for Saturday. We heard the tires,…” My eyes closed as tears fell down. Alec grabbed my hand. “They shot at us.” “Alec got on top of me and covered me. I didn’t know you were hit!” More years started streaming “We got thrown from the car Landed on the hood Lost my phone I was able to open Alec’s door and his phone was there. After I put a turaquette on him, I called you” I looked at Marc “I heard their car so! carried Alec and hid him. He wasn’t moving and lost so much blood Anyway, I heard their car doors knew there was at least three. I can’t take three by myself so I snuck around. I was able to kill one but they heard. I had the gun,” I couldn’t continue as I broke down. Alec pulled me towards him as I cried.noveldrama







###Chapter 58

Chapter 0058 “Ace disobeyed an order. He was suppose to get the flank as I knew his judgement was clouded. When he jumped in, they panicked and shot. He took one bullet and your phone took the other. It was right over her heart.” Dad said. “It saved her life.” “Did they say what they wanted “Marc asked. “They wanted me.” I said quietly. “You?” Marc asked to clarify. “Didn’t say why. Said they were there for me. I was thinking about going with them to get them away from Alec.” “Never put your life in danger for me. You hear me? Never!” Alec said firmly as he forced me to look at him. “Marc, where do we stand?” Dad asked as he looked on. “I bare no ill will. As far as I’m concerned, she saved his life and then protected him with hers. If my son is right, she will just as much my daughter as yours.” “We track them together.” Dad held out his hand.

“Kill them all.” Marc h ook dads hand as their alliance strengthened. “For what it’s worth, you have our deepest sympathy at the loss of your future beta. It goes without saying, whatever you need.” “I appreciate it” Dad looked at me. “I need to get back and inform his I’m “I’m staying here.” “I’ll stay with her.” Colt said. “We aren’t going anywhere.” Marc sat down Dad k*ssed my forehead and looked deep in my eyes. parents. noveldrama

“I love you kiddo.” “You too, dad.” Dad and Jacob walked out. Colt sighed as he took a seat on the other side of the room. “What did they say for you?” I asked Alec. “Tissue damage mainly. Should heal soon but it did nick the artery. You really did save my life.” I nodded as I looked down at the floor. The room fell silent as we were all processing what do say. Alec pulled me back so I was resting against I saw a light flash, forcing my annoyance to come out. “The f uck Colt?” “How did you know it was me?” He chuckled. “You are the only one st upid enough or brave enough to take a picture right now.” “Emmy has been blowing up my phone wanting to talk to you. I told her you were sleeping. She didn’t believe me.” “Have Jasper go get her and bring her here.” I muttered. “I think he’s already got her. She wasn’t taking no for an answer and now that Jasper knows Alec is okay…” “Okay.” Opening my eyes, I looked over at Colt. “Colt tell me the truth.” “Not good. In time.” I nodded as I went back to closing my eyes. “You didn’t even ask him anything?” Marc looked weird out “They got this twin language. It takes some getting used to “Alec muttered. “Where is SHE?” We heard Emmy yell. “I’m her alpha and she is worried about you.” Alec sighed. “Get used to it.” I said as Emmy came barreling in. She looked at how Alec and I were laying before coming over to me. “I’m okay.” Sitting up, she hugged me. Tears fell down both of our faces. “I was so worried. Ace died! He was…. a brother to us! He loved you. Like truly loved you.” “I know. Emmy, I know.”

Emmy grabbed a tissue and dried my eyes. “Are you okay?” Emmy asked Alec. “I’m fine.” His tone was not a pleased one. I assume it was because of the fact Ace loved me. “Emmy, let her breath.” Jasper grabbed her shoulders and pulled her back. “Alec?” “I’m good man.” “What the f uck happened?” “Emmy, do you mind getting me something light to eat at the cafeteria?” I asked. “Of course!” Emmy ran out of the room. “We were headed back when someone drove by and shot at us, I took one to the shoulder. We tried to drive away but I passed out. Kris went through the windshield: She put a turaquette on me and called dad. Then she hid me and killed one. Ace saved her by taking a bullet and she took a bullet to her heart.”Alec tossed his phone at Jasper. “Your anger is misplaced. Don’t be mad at her.”







###Chapter 59

Chapter 0059 “You are mad at me? You blame ME for this?” Jasper had the decency to look ashamed. Alec put his hand on my shoulder and gave it a squeeze, “Ice, calm down. Tensions are high now. He almost lost his alpha.” “Yet he f ucking didn’t! Because I f ucking saved him! It wasn’t your f ucking pack that lost someone! If you need a f ucking tampon to rein in your emotions then look in my purse but you better get the f uck out of my eyesight!” My eyes shifted to straight black. Colt stood up. “Jasper, you need to leave.” “Kristen, honey, look at me.” Alec tried to get my attention away from Jasper. Jasper was frozen in his did my wolf spot as he looked at me. Marc stood up and pushed Jasper out. Only when he was gone, relax. Alec put his arm around me and held me close. It helped calm me down. My eyes shifted back. “That is the quickest I’ve seen her wolf calm down.” Colt muttered. “Do you still doubt we are mates? Alec asked, a little smugly. noveldrama

“Nope.” Colt sat in front of me. “Kris.” “What?” “Look at me.” “He’s right. This is all my fault. They wanted me. Alec got hurt because they wanted to kidnap me.” “No, Kristen. This isn’t your fault and Alec would agree with me.” “I do. None of this is your fault.” Alec rubbed my back. “You just need to sleep. Come lay down on the couch.” Colt helped me down and put me on the couch. Putting a pillow under my head, he covered me with a blanket. “Close your eyes and go to sleep.” Colt played with my hair until I fell asleep. Alec’s pov I got it bad. I was already falling in love with that girl, Watching her brother put her to sleep irked me. That was my f ucking job. I didn’t need to wait till Friday to know she was destined to be mine.

Everything s Kristen. Jasper told me about how he felt towards Emmy was how I felt towards Stu pid f ucking Jasper. He pis sed her off more than I had ever seen so far. Her eyes were f ucking black!! that. “This isn’t her fault.” Colt whispered to me. “Never thought it was.” He was too dam n protective of her but I get it. She is special. Just didn’t like it. “Get your man in line before she does. Her wolf is ancient and loves the taste of blood.” That confession shocked me. “I’m gathering that. What else should I know?” “My wolf is the twin of hers. This isn’t a threat but we don’t lose and we don’t stop till there are bodies. I’ve been able to keep her reined in but if it’s true, your her mate, that’s your job now. You need to figure out a way to be able to soothe her.” 1200 “How has she not lost it on An n?” “Two reasons. One, me. I’ve stopped it. Two, killing An n would kill our dad. He already lost one mate.” “So she deals with it.” “Kristen has the kindest soul. It balances out the blood she has spilled. If you notice, she doesn’t even. think about the rogue she killed with her fingers. She’s upset Ace died. The fact she cares keeps her grounded.” “Did she love him too?” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!







###Chapter 60

Chapter 0060 Alec POV “Not in that way. He’s always been a big brother to her. One she would occasionally make out with but that was it. I commanded Ace to never take it further. I don’t think she knows that. However, she used him for stress relief when An n was at her worst. Ace knew that but he got caught up in her. For what it’s worth, it was never about choosing between you two. It was about choosing you and not hurting Aces feelings.” “Good.” “Do you love her?” “Just about.” I said without hesitation. “Good. She needs a strong man to look after her. I knew I wasn’t going to fill that role forever. I’m trying to not get in the way but da mn if I won’t be there for her. I had to listen to her scream daddy before the sickening sound of metal hitting wood. The sound of her b*dy going through glass is one I’ll never unhear.” “I was hoping I could make it to my pack before I passed out. I honestly didn’t feel it at first. My only thought was to get her home and safe.” “Tomorrow’s Wednesday. Obviously she won’t be going to school. Hell, she should have just tested out of high school in 8th grade.” “Assuming you’re beefing up security on Friday?”

“Yes.” “I’ll send my men over too.” “We’d appreciate it.” “Anything for her “I muttered. “Agreed.”

“Listen man, I’m sorry about Ace. I truly am. Losing a best friend and beta is hard.” Colt nodded his head as he looked at Kristen. Sighting, he reached a hand out to me. “I’ll get going. I’ll get you both new phones tomorrow. I’ll be taking this to get it analysed.” 1 “Thanks, man.” Jasper walked as Col Without missing a beat, Colt delivered a perfect right h ook, knocking Jasper over. Unfortunately for Jasper, he was still awake, Colt grabbed his shirt and pulled him close. You better watch your mouth around my sister or next time there will be more blood.” Dropping him, Colt stepped over him and walked away. “F uck.” Jasper groaned as he stood up “You deserved it.” I said glaring at him. “Yeah, I know. I thought you were dead. You were lifeless with blood covering you.” “Need that tampon my girl offered you?” “Your girl huh?” “Believe so.” “She will be a da mn good Luna.” “That she will. Maybe you will live to see it.” “When do you get to get out?” X “I’m leaving tomorrow regardless. Only staying here because she is sleeping.” “Emmy’s pi ssed at me.” “We need to talk about her.” “F uck” “You need to let her do things her way and not how your mother did them. Let her try new project and figure it out. Stop holding her back.” “Is that you or Luna over there talking?” I got a warm satisfied feeling from him calling her Luna. “Both.”

“Okay. I’ll release the reins.” Jasper sighed. “I’m standing guard. That is my punishment. Marc took Emmy home after she chewed my as s out.” “Good. Go guard and let me sleep.” I wasn’t tired but I was done talking. Jasper went to leave but stopped, and looked at me. “I’m glad your okay and I’m sorry for my behavior.” “It’s not me you need to apologize to.” I said. Jasper nodded and walked out the room. Closing the door behind him. Closing my eyes, I drifted into a restless sleep. I was in and out of it until I felt movement beside me. Looking down, Kristen crawled into bed with me. Wrapping my girl arm around her, I finally slept decently. Kristen’s pov A sound woke me from my sleep. Alec was still sleeping peacefully but the angry voices outside woke me. As I tried to get out of bed, my muscles reminded me that I got thrown through a windshield. Gingerly walking, I put my ear to the door to listen. “You are not going in there!” Jasper whispered angerly. “The f uck I’m not!” I was Jacob. 1 Opening the door, I walked out. Both boys froze as they realized they were in deep s hit now. “What the f uck is going on here?”noveldrama








###Chapter 61

Chapter 0061 “Ice, it’s Ace’s dad. He went f ucking crazy. They had to sedate him. He’s blaming you for not picking him. over Alec.” “There is no reason to tell her this now! This could have waited till later. What do you expect her to do?” Jasper was strangely on my side. Giving him a weird look, I crossed my arms over my chest. “I don’t know. This whole thing is f ucked up. My brother died. I just…” Jacob was lost. “Sit down.” I said to Jacob. He listened instantly as out his head in his hands. “I don’t blame him for his reaction. He just lost a son. His only son. I would had been surprised if he took it well. Ace died a hero and will be honored as such. I feel your pain. He was my brother too. He was part of us and will always be part of us. It would be a disgrace to his memory if we fell apart and didn’t seek out who killed him. We will figure this out and get our revenge but you need to keep your head in the game. We can’t afford to lose you too.” “I know your right but dam n.” Jacob was lost. “I know. My eyes hurt and dried out as I can’t cry anymore. We will keep him with us.” I saw Colt running down the hall. He sighed as he realized he was too late. “Sis, why are you out of bed?” “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have come.” Jacob stood up. “You can always come to me. Jacob, just keep on pushing. For Ace.” He nodded as he turned to walk back.

“You okay?” Colt asked. “Sore but good.” Colt nodded as he took off after Jacob. I had just opened the door when Jasper talked. “Kris, I’m sorry.” “Save it. Not in the mood.” I noticed the bruising on his cheek. “Colt?”

“Yeah.” “You’re lucky that’s all you got.” I said before going back inside. “What’s going on?” Alec asked. “Jacob said Ace’s dad needed sedated.” “Come here.” Alec opened his arm for me. Inching my way over, I crawled up next to him. “What do you want to do to honor Ace?” “What do you mean?” His question threw me. “Do you want a certain tree? A ceremony?” “Oh um, I’m not sure.” I guess I don’t know what I wanted. Resting my head against his shoulder, Alec held my thigh. “Just let me know and we will do that.” Alec k*ssed the top of my head. “What changed? Why are you acting like this? Last night you were upset when Emmy said he loved me.” “Colt and I talked.” “Oh.” Dam n him. “What else did you talk about?” “Nothing really.” “That’s a lie but whatever. I just want to go home and shower.” “Which home is that? Mine or your old pack?” My first thought was with Alec but his question was as right. “I guess your home isn’t mine.” “But it is.” “Maybe on Friday but right now, I’m just a guest.” “You’re coming home with me. End of story.” “I wasn’t arguing.” Sipped off the bed, Alec pressed the call button. Getting his stuff, he put his sweats on that his dad brought him. “What do you need?” A nurse came in. “We are leaving.” Alec muttered.

“Any chance you can wait a few more hours?” “No.” Alec said as he pulled his gown off. He kept his sling on. “Alright. Sign these.” The nurse handed him paperwork. “Call if you need anything.” She sighed and left. “What’s up?” Jacob popper his head in. 2 “We are leaving.” Alec pushed the wheel chair over to me. “Sit.” I was too sore to argue Sitting down, Jasper took over pushing as we walked out of the hospital. It was still early morning. The car wasn’t far away so we got in okay. Alec sat in the back with me as Jasper drove. Leaning on him for support, I found my eyes falling. “She’s sleeping.” Jasper whispered. “Good.” Alec sighed. “I told her I was sorry and she didn’t want to hear it.”noveldrama







###Chapter 62

Chapter 0062 Alec snored. “You’re surprised?” @ “No. Just wish she forgave me.” “Maybe after she showers and rests.” Alec’s hand rested on my hip. It was like he didn’t need to wait till Friday to know. That confused me but I decided to accept it. I must have drifted off as next think I knew was the car doors opening. “We are home.” Alec whispered. He got out and helped me out. “How are you not sore?” 1 was unconscious so my muscles didn’t get strained like yours did when you were thrown from the car.” un “How’s your arm feel?” I asked. The sun was rising but thankfully we didn’t run into anyone. Alec walked me straight into his room. “Stay h here.” He muttered as he went to his closet. Coming out with his Tshirt. “Do you want to shower?” “Yes please.” Alec walked to the bathroom and turned it on. Following him, he laid out female soaps anything I could ask for. “Who’s are those?” I asked annoyed. Alec smirked. “I had someone buy them for you. I didn’t know what you liked so…” “You didn’t just ask Emmy?”

“Didn’t think of that.” “Thank you.” Grabbing some shampoo, conditioner and b*dy wash and put them in the shower. “Do you need help?” “No, I’m good thanks.” Alec looked conflicted. “Alec, get out.” He smirked before leaning down to k*ss me softly then left. noveldrama

Undressing, I got in. The hot water stung but after a minute it felt amazing. I washed my hair and b*dy but then just stood there. It massages my muscles. They will feel better by tomorrow by I’m sure. Getting out, I put lotion on and put on Alec’s shirt. He didn’t give me panties so I guess I was sleep like this. After brushing my hair and my teeth, I walked out. “Still alive?” Alec asked. “Barely. That felt good.” He was laying in bed, reading. “Take those.” He pointed to two white pills on the night stand. “What are they?” “Tylenol.” “What are you reading?” I asked as I took the pills and crawled in beside him. “The Tempest.” “Ah, William Shakespeare.” “You know it?” “Read it a few years ago. Not my favorite of his but still good.” Alec set the book down and turned off his light. The blinds were pulled,making it pitch black. I was as asleep instantly. When I woke up, I was alone. Looking around, I saw the bathroom had steam coming from it. Testing my muscles, I was still sore but felt okay. My stomach rumbles. The clock read 1:36pm. Dam n, slept a good amount. Standing up, I was just about to go across the ha when I spotted my suitcase by the closet. Grabbing a pair of panties, lose shorts, sports bra and tank, I got dressed. I was finished putting my hair in a messy bun when Alec came out of the bathroom in just a towel.

“Turn around.” I was scared to see what it looked like. “I think it looks bad as s.” Iv “It doesn’t look too bad. Let me put lotion on it.” “Yes, ma’am.” Walking to the bathroom, I grabbed the lotion and came back out. “You’re walking better.” I “Shower, meds and sleep helped. Now I need food.” I said as I put the lotion on his back. “On the bright side, you were my Wednesday appointment so I don’t have to cancel anyone.” “There is that.” Alec grabbed some shorts. Turning my back, I pretended to look for something so I didn’t get caught looking. “Ready?” Alec asked. “Yeah. As much as I am going to get today.” “It’s Wednesday and you haven’t trained at all.” “I’ve been busy.” I said as we went down the stairs. Alec wasn’t wearing his sling but still kept the bandage on his arm. “Oh, Alpha! I was so worried about you!” A few girls ran up to him. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!! I love reading all your comments! 07







###Chapter 63

Chapter 0063 Alec grabbed my hand. “We are okay. Please excuse us.” They all looked shocked as we walked to the kitchen. “Alpha Alec, Ms. Kristen! Can I get you something to eat?” An elderly kitchen staffer asked. “Yes, please.” I said as we sat down. “What do you want?” She asked. Alec looked towards me. “Whatever easiest. I’m just hungry.” “Yes, dear.” We watched as she made us cold cut sandwiches. Wrapping them, she made us each a fruit bowl and a side of pasta. “Thank you.” Taking our food with a plastic fork, we headed out. “This way.” Alec said. He headed towards the front door. “Oh?” “Sunshine will do you some good.” We walked a little ways to a picnic area. It was in a park with kids. running around that were too young for school. “This feels nice.” “I like to come out here and eat on nice days.” I “What else do you like?” I asked genuinely curious.

“Oh, I don’t know. Watching you do your thing.” “Come on, I’ve told you a lot about me,” I pushed. “Fine. I like to read, star gaze, Sunday cruising, relaxing with friends.” “All basic stuff” I frowned. There was a pause as Alec thought about it. “I’m a movie ju nkie.” “What kinds of movies?” “All of them. Black and white ones to modern Disney.”

“Disney? Not a Rambo kind of guy?” +15 BONUS “Moana isn’t bad “That made me laugh. “I can’t picture it.” “And I collect books.” “I knew that. I need to go look at what you have. I have a few at home that I think you will be interested in.” “You can put your books on the free side of the library on Saturday when you move in.” “So sure aren’t you?” “Yup, 99.9% sure.” “Why?” “Colt said my wolf calmed yours down extremely fast. Faster than he has done. Plus the way your b*dy. responded to my touch.” “Colt told you about our wolves? For some reason that annoyed me. “Yes. I think he wanted to see if I’d run.” “Do you?” “Not even a little. I would tell the pack you’re my girl today if I thought you would go for it.” I frowned at that. “Exactly. That’s why I said move on Saturday.” “My wolf didn’t scare you?” “Nope, just turned him on actually.” “Has anything I told you scared you?” “Not sure scared is the right word. Maybe nervous or anxious but the answer is still no. You intrigue me. I find you fascinating, se xy, warm.” “Not intelligent?” “Obviously you are but that’s not your only quality. Your heart is massive.” That caught me off guard as I blinked s few times. Most people can’t get pasted my brains or my looks.

Thank you.” It took me a second to put another bite in my mouth as I was still processing his words. “No one ever told you that before?” Alec asked, pulling me out of my trans. “No one that matters.” “W” Alec froze as I assumed he was getting a mind-link. “You about done?” “Yeah, why?” “They just brought my car back.” Well s hit. Time to put on my big girl panties and get this going “Okay. Let’s go Alec took our to-go bores and tossed them in the trash. We started walking to the garage. “Colt’s here “Right on time.” The sun did feel amazing on my skin. Almost like I was lacking the needed vitamin D it offered. I wasn’t overly excited to see the vehicle but it was my job. Turning the corner, everyone was outside as the tow driver lowered it down. After he unhooked it, he drove off. “Hey, Ice. How are you feeling today?” Colt came over and gave me a hug. Alec kept walking to his dad “Better. The shower and sleep helped.” “Should feel normal by Friday.” Colt nodded. “This is my hope.” We walked up to the vehicles. “Hey, kiddo. Doing okay?” Dad asked but didn’t approach me. Guess who I got my emotion habits from “Yeah, dad. I’m good.” Everyone was just looking at the car but I started walking around it. It was peppered with bullet holes but it was the one that got Alec that surprised me. From the blood on the car where we were ducking, it was a bullet that went through both sides. It was a bigger hole.noveldrama







###Chapter 64

Chapter 0064 “What do you see, Ice?” Colt asked. “The bullet that shot Alec came through the car and it was a different gun. The hole is bigger. Almost like they tried to kill Alec to take me easier. Alec and I could have easily handled three rogues. Almost like this was a plan B. It wasn’t well thought out. They could have attacked me in the shop and gotten a better outcome.” I made my way to the windshield and had a flashback of my b*dy going through it. “Look at the angle, the gun that shot Alec was on a roof. I bet they knew he would get on top of me, so he was an easy shot. The drive by was to get him in place.” The whole thing made me sick to my stomach. Why would anyone want me? There is literally nothing. special about me. I don’t shoot fire out of my hands or lasers out of my eyes. I can’t fly or freeze water. I ami just a highly intelligent person. I “Then I guess we are lucky they only took one shot.” Marc folded his arms. Colt’s phone started ringing. He stepped away to take it. “He could have shot me when we walked out.” Alec muttered. “Those windows are tinted so you can’t see inside. I bet he wasn’t ready and that was his only option.” My

eyes went back to the hood. There was smear marks in blood. “Kristen.” Colt’s tone of voice plus the use of my full name had me worried. “What’s wrong?” I asked glancing at Alec. He had an unreadable expression. “It’s…it’s the shop. Someone broke in and trashed it. Cops are there now.” My jaw dropped as tears threatened to fall. My heart literally shattered as it sank in. “Kristen?” “Take me there.” Taking a deep breath, I kept my head high.

Colt looked worriedly at Alec. “Maybe it’s best if-” “If you don’t finish that statement and you either drive me or I will drive myself.” I said firmly. Colt sighed. “Let’s go.” Alec instantly started following Colt. This wasn’t going to break me. I kept repeating that. The entire way to the store, I kept to myself and stayed strong. Alec tried to hold my hand but I pushed him away. Not that I didn’t want his comfort but if anyone touched me, I’d lose my composure. When we got there, cops had surrounded it. It was marked off with yellow caution tape. “This is a bad idea.” Alec muttered to Colt. “I know. She’s barely holding herself together and yes the threat on her life.” I heard them but I didn’t. Walking up, the police tried to stop me. “No passing this point!” “That’s my business! I own that!” I could feel my anger growing. “Please come in. Be careful.” “They are with me.” I said getting Alec and Colt to come in. As I walked up to the store, broken glass littered the sidewalk. There was blood on the sideway. Standing on top of it. I calculated the angle of the shot. “Colt, the shooter was on that building.” I looked over to the middle sized one. “You sure?” “You doubt me?” I asked. “No.” “What’s up?” Alec asked as he walked up to us. “Shooter was from that building “Colt whispered very low that a human wouldn’t hear. “She figure that out?” “Yes.” Colt replied. Again, I ignored them as I made my way inside. Everything was broken. My chair, the 360 mirror. Floor had holes, sterilization was in pieces. Ink splattered on the walls. My portfolio book was ripped tonoveldrama

shreds. Alec and Colt walked as I was looking at two half’s of a full leg I did last year. Letting it fall, I just felt empty. This was my pride and joy. My baby. This was giving me my future. “Kristen Jeffreys?” A detective asked. “Yes.” “I have a few questions. When were you here last?” “Yesterday afternoon.” I was looking at the link on the wall. It started to not look so random.






###Chapter 65

Chapter 0065 “When did you leave?” “I don’t know. It was getting late.” “Was anyone with you?” “I was.” Alec stepped forward. “She finished my back.” “Know anyone who would do this?” The detective asked, “No.” Then it hit me. It was an abstract moon. A midnight moon. As in the Midnight Moon Pack. Darin. “No…” I said as I took a step back in shock. “What was that?” The detective asked. “Colt. It was the Midnight Moon Pack. Look at the ink. It’s their logo.” I mind-linked Colt. He looked at it and frowned. “Miss?” The detective touched me shoulder. Making me jump. “Nothing.” Alec moved behind me. “I want to leave now. I’ll be on touch and I’ll give you a list of broke items for insurance.” The detective handed me his card but Alec took it. “Thanks.” He said for me.

As soon as we were in the car, I grabbed Colt’s phone. Googling the pack, I held it up for him to see. It was a match. “Da mn.” Colt took the phone and showed Alec. “They painted their logo on my wall.” I said to Alec. “F uck.” Alec muttered. Sitting back, I let my anger stew. This was f ucking b ulls hit. Just because I wouldn’t go on a date or chose him. He was destroying my life. “We need to have a meeting.” Colt told Alec. “Agreed, Brian still at my pack?” “Yeah. I’ll go there and we can meet now. This just got turned up.” Colt stepped on it. I didn’t know what I

wanted. Did I want to go to this meeting or be alone for a bit. When we got to the pack house, I found myself hanging back. Colt and Alec marched on with a purpose. towards me but Colt stopped him. Colt understood I needed a minute. Alec looked conflicted but in the end, whatever Colt said to him, made him turn around and go inside. The wind pulled at my hair as I leaned against the car. Taunting me with it’s freedom. My legs started moving as I walked. No where in particular, just walked. There was a small playground with some swings. It called me as I sat down and slowly moved back and forth. The sight of Ace laying there, the feel of my b*dy breaking through glass, my head bouncing off the hood, Alec passing out from blood loss, to finally my shot bring destroyed. I ure how for The sun was starting to drop and the lighting bugs came out. I wasn’t I’ve been here but my as s was numb. “Where are you, sis?” “Some small playground in a swing.” “Okay. Sit tight.” I have, my as s is numb” “Geez “Colt probably rolled his eyes but a second later they came into focus. Their relieve on their face was clear. Alec sat beside me as Colt stood. “We need to close the bar “I said. “Yeah, most likely “Yeah, most likely.” Colt agreed. “Make sure everyone still gets paid for two weeks. We aren’t sure how long it needs to stay close but that noveldrama

will get the by till they find a job.” I said as my foot drew a pattered in the sand.? “Okay. I’m going to head home.” “Drive safe.” I said looking at him “Alec has your phone. I programmed yours already. Alec will need to do his.” “Thank you.” “Stay safe.” Colt said before turning and walking away. “I’ll never understand your twin bond.” “Many have tried.” “If you want to stay in a different room, that’s okay.” Alec stated with a stotic face. That confused me, “You don’t want me with you?”








###Chapter 66

Chapter 0066 “I do but you seem to need your space. Colt said give you space.” “Not that kind of space. Just wait for me to be ready for you to touch me like holding my hand. Just… Physically be there but I’ll come to you when in ready to be comforted.” “Oh.” “Sorry. Didn’t mean to make you feel any type of way.” out! “I’m just figuring out how to help you. Learn you really. Don’t be sorry.” “You’re doing a a job” I I gave him a small smile. We just sat together for a few more minutes. “How’s your arm feeling?” “Sore but okay.” Alec sighed. “Seems silly to have a birthday party on Friday. “It will give something for people to look forward to after Ace’s funeral.” “I didn’t give him a basket.” I frowned. “Colt did. I asked.” “Thank you.” “Funeral is tomorrow at 10am.” Alec sighed.

“Hmm” “Emmy has a dress for you.” It was like he read my mind. “Of course she does.” I gave a small chuckle. “It might be best if we show up separate. Emmy will go in a car early with you and you guys can sit together as a group. We will be in the back of you need us.” “Thank you for understanding.”

“Just make sure you come to me.” Alec sighed. His pocessive side was starting to show. “Okay.” “Come on. You need food before bed.” Alec stood up but didn’t offer me his hand. “I’m not hungry.” “Try? Please?” “Fine.” I sighed as we walked. The stars started showing as we walking into the pack house. There wasn’t as much activity as I figured there would be. Alec took us straight to the private dinning area where two plates of pasta was waiting. I ate about a fourth when I finally put my fork down and leaned back. “I’m done.” “Okay.” Alec surprisingly didn’t argue as he stood up. We went straight to the bedroom where he starting looking for a movie. Grabbing some silk pajama set, I got changed in the bathroom. When I was done, Alec had picked a movie and was in nothing but shorts. We climbed into bed. The TV was moved so it was at the foot of the bed. Alec moved the pillows so he was propped up. Moving his arm, I curled into him, resting my head on his chest as he pulled me close before hitting play. I was asleep before the movie title came. on. Then next morning, I woke up to text on Alecs phone. He turned over and replied “who’s that?” “Dad.” “What time is it?” “8:03.” “I should get up and shower. When’s Emmy coming over?” “In 30 minutes.” Alec yawned.

I Alec set his phone down as I went to get out of bed. Alec caught me and pulled me towards him. “Not so fast.” “Oh?” “How are you? I can’t wait to be mated so I will know without asking.” “I don’t really know. Sad… Confused. Maybe guilty.” “It wasn’t your fault.” Alec cupped my face. “Yeah.” I didn’t look him in the eyes. “I’m serious. Keep your head up today. I’m here if you need me.” “Thank you.” Alec gave me a soft k*ss that made my l*ps tingle. *Felt that did you?” He asked as I touched my l*ps. “Yeah, what was that?” “The mate bond. I have felt it since yesterday.” “I don’t turn 18 till tomorrow.” “Jasper said he felt a light version of the bond the day before Emmy turned 18.” Alec studied my face. “Oh….” My spirit lifted a little having some clarity in it. “Oh?” Alec raised an eyebrow. “I assumed it would hit full force the moment my birthday comes. I didn’t realize there was a built up.” “Me either. Jasper said he knew when he met Emmy that she was his mate. Remember how he was stuck on her?” “Yeah, I do.” It was in my tattoo shop. “Are you upset?” “About what?” I asked “About being my mate?”

“No.” I scooted up so my forehead was against his. “Just absorbing it all. I wouldn’t have given you my b*dy if I doubted it.” Alec’s hands wrapped around me. Inoveldrama

Chapter 0067 “Such a perfect b*dy.” He muttered as he k*ssed my neck. It sent shivers down my spine. “Nope. I need to shower.” Pushing him away. I got out of bed quickly so he couldn’t pull me down again. I needed to shower quickly so I was ready when Emmy came. Since I didn’t have my robe and Alec wasn’t around, I grabbed one of his button ups to wear. I had just put on a pair of my panties when a knock was on the door. “Hey.” I said as I opened the door for her. “Good, you been in the shower.” “Yes ma’am.” “I’m sorry about your shop.” Emmy said as she put her stuff dow.. “Me too.” I sat on the chair and watched her unpack. “You and Alec huh?” Her voice was shaking as she was trying to keep herself from crying. “Guess so.” Luna?” “Do I get to call you Luna?”

“Not till tomorrow.” Turning around, she got to work on my hair. “I always knew you were destined to be a Luna.” “I’m glad we get to live together again.” I said looking at her. “Me too. I really missed our friendship.” I squeezed her hand. “I hope you have waterproof makeup.” “Bought some yesterday.” Emmy laughed. Emmy worked quietly as I just stared at myself in the mirror. This was all surreal. Never once did I think we would be attending his funeral before we were even 18. Emmy was lightly curling my hair and putnoveldrama

the finishing my makeup. The guys walked in as Emmy was handing me my dress. “How is it going?” Alec walked in and did a double take of what I was wearing. Instant butterflies turned my stomach as I stood there. Jasper went up to Emmy so out interaction went unnoticed. “Just getting ready to change.” +15 BONUS Alecs eyebrow raises as I swear I saw a hint of arousal in his eyes. “Okay. We need to get going. You girls should get there early to greet people.” Nodding, I went into the bathroom and shut the door. It was easy to unbutton Alecs shirt and sl*p into the dress. It was a simple black dress. Sleeveless with a modest cut. In it was a looser fit but still flattered my b*dy. It came down to my lower thigh. Perfect for a funeral. Emmy had the best fashion sense. Emmy came in to change as well. “Here are your shoes.” “Thank you.” I said as I sl*pped them on. Emmy got changed in a similar dress and sl*ppered her shoes on. She had done her hair and makeup before coming. We stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the mirror. Knock! Knock! Knock! “Ready?” Jasper asked sweetly. “No.” I said lamely as Emmy opened the door. Emmy sagged into Jaspers arm as she broke a little and shed a tear. I felt too numb as I walked out. Alec was standing there, waiting. Both guys were in all black with their black button up sleeves rolled. Hair was gelled and freshly trimmed beard. “Doing okay?” He asked. “I guess.” I said as I grabbed my phone and purse. “Lets go.” Jasper said as him and Emmy walked out. Alec waited for me as I took a breath and followed

them. He stopped me to give me a quick k*ss before following Emmy and Jasper. “You girls take this vehicle.” Jasper opened the door for me to drive. Emmy wasn’t emotionally in a spot to drive “There are warriors lined the whole way there to take sure you get there okay. We will leave in ten minutes.” Alec said as I got in and started the car. Emmy waved bye as I mouthed bye to Alec. We were silent the whole way. I would catch glimpses of the warriors every now and then. Colt and Jacob were waiting for us as we pulled up. “Kristen…” Emmys voice broke as we came to a stop. “I know.” We saw the black tent and smoke in the background. Grabbing her hand, I gave it a squeeze. Colt and Jacob opened our car doors for us. Helping us out of the car. The four of us wrapped our arms around each other as we walked towards the tent. Colt had my on his side with us girls between them. That way, Jasper wouldn’t get jealous over Jacob.







###Chapter 68

Chapter 0068 Together we made our way to the entrance and started greeting everyone as they entered. One by one, our pack filled the tent. Ace’s b*dy laid at the front, making me keep my attention on the back. Only once everyone came up, did we see Alec, and the ranking wolves of his pack make their way up. Jasper went straight to Emmy. She fell into his arms, breaking down again. Alec came up to me and k*ssed my check “You okay?” “Holding it together.” Alec shook Jacobs and Colt’s hands, as did everyone else. Once Emmy let go of Jasper, he did too. My b*dy stiffened as dad and An n walked up with Ace’s dad. When he saw aw me, he stopped walking. Ace walked up behind me. Dad whispered something in his ear and he put his head down and walked right past me and to the front. I wasn’t as lucky with An n. “You have some nerve showing up here” An n put her hand on her hips. noveldrama

“Enough An n.” Colt stepped in front of me. “Watch yourself, he won’t be around to save you every time.” An n glared as she walked off. “Maybe I should stay back here I muttered to Colt. “No. You are coming up and sitting with us.” Colt looked murderous. “Colt…” nodded to me. “Kristen, no. You’re coming.” Alec put his hand on my shoulder. Looking up at him, he r Frowning, I grabbed Colt’s hand for support as we walked down the isle. I kept my head high but it took everything I had in me. Dad, An n and Ace’s dad was in the left side, we sat in the right. Once we were sitting, Dad stood up.

“Today, we celebrate the life of one of our own. Taken too soon but died a hero. Ace was a son, bro a son, brother to many of us and a friend. Ace touched so many of our lives and will continue to inspire the bravery he showed. Aces sacrifice has earned him out highest level of respect with an Ash Elm Tree.” The crowd erupted in cheers. “The family has decided to open the microphone up to those how would like to say a few words.” Colt stood up, adjusted his suit and walked up to the microphone. After clearing his throat, he started. talking. “Ace was like my brother. We grew up together, learned how to throw together, talk to girls and just be a man. He was by not only my side, but my sister’s as well. The three of us were inseparable. Then Emmy wiggled in and then Jacob. The five of us became more than friends. We were family.

###Chapter 69

Chapter 0069 Colt stepped aside. Jacob shook his head no and I was clinging to Emmy for my life. After a second, Colt picked up the torch and placed it on the wood under Ace’s b*dy. It instantly went up in flames, making me flinch back. Colt walked back to us and sat down. Soft music played as we watched Ace being ash. Dad sat there for about ten minutes before he stood up and walked up front. “There will be food and drinks located in the backyard of the pack house. The family has asked for anyone to come and join the continuation of celebrating Ace.” People started getting up and making their way to the backyard. A few people lingered but most headed down. Looking over, only Ace’s dad was there, watching the fire. Taking a deep breath, I was about to do something seriously brave or seriously s tupid. “Excuse me, sir “My b*dy was shaking as I approached him. I felt so many pairs of eyes on me. “What?” The hatred was thick in his eyes. Seriously st upid it was.

“I would like to tell you how sorry I am. Ace was someone I admired and loved as a brother. I know my pain is nothing compared to yours, but I want you to know that I do feel guilty and I will have to live with that guilt.” I to I took a deep breath as he looked at me. “I also know because of who I am, you probably haven’t gotten to vent the way you need to. I am giving you permission to tell me what you want to. You can yell, scream or cuss. Whatever you feel you need to get off your chest. This is your chance.” The shock on his face was clear. I waited as he stood up. I swear there wasn’t a single breath being taken around me as they waited to see what would happen. “Young lady, I watched you grow up. I know what kind of person you are. I have wanted nothing but to do

what you just said. My boy loved you and that got him killed. You poisoned his brain, shattered his heart and took his last breath. I know you will carry this with you. I know what it means to be a ranking wolf but if he didn’t love you like he did, he would have never taken that bullet. There might be forgiveness in my heart, but that day is not today.” He turned and walked away. Tears were silently running down my face as I kept looking at him in the eyes. Right as I was about to turn back to my friends, a sharp pain erupted across my cheek. It caught me so off I guard that I stumbled. Hands caught me before I completely fell. “F ucking da mmit, An n!” Dad roared. Looking over, dad had An n by the arm in a firm grip. She was smiling evilly at me. I felt something run down my chin. “C unt deserved it.” I knew my eyes went black. “Tomorrow, when we are equals and I’m no longer a member of this pack, we “Alec, get her out of here!” I hear Colt yell as my claws grew. “I command you to go to the cells!” Dad said. “Take her Colt.” Alec tried to get me to move but that wasn’t going to happen. This bi tch was going down. Alec ended up picking me up and tossing me over his shoulders. Thankfully, I had a better view of her kicking and screaming to the cells. Jacob was helping and Alec’s pack was following us to our cars. “Kristen!” Alec firmly yelled in my face. My attention was taken off An n and to him. “Baby girl, breath. Relax your b*dy.” Alec had me pinned against the car. His hands were rubbing my arms up and down, leaving something weird in their path. “I’m going to kill her.” “It’s okay.” “You said you wouldn’t allow her to hit me.” 1 know. I’m sorry, I was too far away to get there in time.”noveldrama







###Chapter 70

Chapter 0070 My b*dy started relaxing as I felt my eyes go back to normal. “Yeah.” Not sure what to say to that.. “Ready to go home?” “Yes.” Regardless who was my mate, I’ll never call this place home, I’ll be packing my bags and never looking back. Alec grabbed a tissue from somewhere that I didn’t see and started to clean up my l*p. “It’s fine. Not deep enough for it to matter.” I muttered as he was looking at it. “ALEC! HOLD UP!” Colt yelled as him and Jacob ran up to us. “I’m so sorry, Kristen.” Colt came up to us. Alec stepped back, allowing Colt to look at my face. “F UCK!” Jacob yelled. It looked like he was going to punch something. “I’m fine.” Reaching over, I grabbed Jacobs arm and helped him cool off. “He was out of line saying that. I’ll tal-”

“You will do no such thing!” I demanded. “That man just lost his son. He is entitled to feel the way he does. Ace literally jumped in front of a bullet to save me. If it helps for him to get that off his chest then I’ll survive. Plus, we all know him. In a week, he will call and apologize. “Ice…” Jacob started. “No, Jacob. You boys listen. I allowed him to talk to me that way. He’s hurting and I am a big girl. My heart will recover. We need to come together as we move forward. Fine a new normal. Who knows who you guys might mate tomorrow. You have a pack you need to think about. Put your pain to the side and be the leader they need. Grieve at night but right now, they need to see that you are not wounded. The pack needs to know that you can protect them, provide for them and still make good judgements. You need to go back there and keep your head up high. You two are the future of this pack. Emmy and I are gone. Even if Alec isn’t my mate, I’m packing my bags and I’ll never be back here. You can’t ask me to. You have everything you need in here.” I put my hand over their hearts. Both of them were looking up

at the sky as I lectured them. “I hope whoever I mate will be half the Luna you will be” Colt wrapped his arms around me. “Ah, Ice. You do have a heart.” Jacob joked as I gave him a hug too. Alec shifted annoyed behind me but ! ignored him. “Don’t tell anyone.” I tried to frown but smiled. “I won’t be far. Close enough to come and kick your as s if “I believe it.” Jacob started walking away. “Colt. I love you.” *S hit, Ice. Did you actually say it first without me forcing you?” He smiled as he hugged me. “Don’t get used to it.” I didn’t even try to not roll my eyes. “What about tomorrow?” Colt asked. “I’m going to get my dresses and take them to Alec’s. We can get ready there and come over together.” “Dam n, so I won’t be there when you guys find out once and for all?” Colt frowned. “I’m not avoiding the man for the entire day of my birthday so you can watch us k*ss that evening.” “It’s a magical moment…” Colt teased. “I hope whoever you get mated to will kick your as s.” All I could do was shake my head. “I doubt it.” Turning to Alec, “I’ll be right back. I’m going to grab my dresses.” “Okay. Need help?” I “I’ll go with her. I’ll need to get mine too then I guess.” Emmy said. “I will be going with you girls. She might be in a cell but still.” Jasper grumbled. Colt frowned but didn’t say anything. Alec POV noveldrama

“How is she really?” I was pis sed I had to asked. This bond can hurry the f uck up and snap into place. “I don’t know how she is standing.” Colt said in a sullen voice. “Has she even asked about the meeting yet?”







###Chapter 71

Chapter 0071 Da mn this man. Is there anything he doesn’t know about her? “Nope. She hasn’t asked and I haven’t tried to tell her.” “She will probably ask this afternoon.” “Do you want to be there when we tell her?” I asked. Accepting their weird bond was easier said than done. It wasn’t a jealousy issue really but the fact he could read her and I was struggling. I wanted to be able to do that too. “Whatever you want, dude. If you feel like I need to be there I will, if not, I’m sure you can handle whatever

she throws at you.” I appreciated his response. “I’ll call if it gets out of hand.” “Alright. I’ll have my phone ready. If I might suggest. I know times aren’t safe but taking her out to a secluded place and watch the stars tonight might be a good way to relax her from this stuff and for what tomorrow will bring. Or just anything.” Was he really telling me how to calm her so I could f uck her when the bond snaps in? I was both impressed and annoyed by this. He didn’t know I’ve already done it twice. The second time, she was much more relaxed. “Thanks, man. I’ll keep that in mind.” We were shaking hands when the girls came back out. Both of them smiling and Jasper was shaking his head. Not sure I want to know what they did to him. Jasper took their dresses and laid them down in the trunk before he told Emmy and Kristen get in the car. Her b*dy told me not to touch her. Angled towards the window, chin resting on her hand, which was on the window. As much as I wanted to hold her hand, I just drove. Men tally, I knew she still had some reserves as to us being mates but emotional, it stung. Maybe Colt was right. I should make tonight really special, Picking up my phone, I got to work. Kristen’s pov

There was something final about a funeral. Before it, you expect them to walk into the room at any moment. After, the acceptance was tolerable. It will be weird living in a world that Ace wasn’t in. He was always right beside me, protecting me, loving me. As we drove, the more I felt like I was putting that world behind me and starting something new. First thing first, I needed to get out of this dress. As soon as we pulled up, I made a beeline to Alec’s room to change. I knew he was following me but I was on a mission. However, I did leave the door open for him to come in. As I was looking through my bag for what I wanted, he walked past me, pulling his shirt out of his pants. As much as I tried to resist, my eyes caught a peak of his muscular back and my amazing artwork on it. Needing to escape, my as s darted to the bathroom. Looking at myself in the mirror, I didn’t recognize the person in front of me. Her l*p was cut, shadows under her eyes and just looked sullen. Taking a deep breath, it was time to put her big girl panties on and take charge. Changing into shorts and a workout top, I was going to be working today. My muscles were still sore but that wasn’t going to stop me. Not that i was going to let Alec tell me no but it was time to face him. As I exited the bathroom, I found him sitting on the edge of his bed in shorts and a tank. “What are your plans for the day?” I asked. “I cleared my schedule to do whatever you wanted.” Alec stated as he leaned forward so his elbows were on his knees. His eyes ranked my b*dy, making me blush, “I want to clean my shop up.” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! I promise everything about An n will come together! ל 11noveldrama







###Chapter 72

Chapter 0072 “Okay, let’s go.” “Really?” “Really.” “Just like that?” It felt like a trap. “What did you expect? For me to lock you in here?” Alec stood up and walked over to me. “Well, I expected you to try.” I said, slowly. Alec walked up to me and sighed as he leaned down to whisper in my ear. “When I lock you in here, you won’t be complaining. You will be moaning my name till morning.” My panties instantly got wet as he leaned back satisfied and walked towards the door. “Coming?” “More than one way “I muttered as I walked past him. A chuckled erupted in his chest as he slapped my

as s. Trying to glare at him just made him smirk more. We walked to the car and got in, which is when I started questioning him. “Why are you so chill about going to clean that place up? I figured I’d be fighting you on this.” “Well, I knew how important this is to you. Plus, I have a team dropping off a dumpster for us to clean it out. Also, there are many volunteers that are coming to help.” “You had this organized?” My jaw dropped. Alec leaned over and closed it. “I’ll have that mouth open later. However, I’ll take partial credit. Colt will take the rest.” “What do you mean take it apart?* “I’m sorry but nothing is salvageable. You will have to do a complete upgrade. Use this chance to change the layout or whatever you want differently.” ither are you. “Alec, I don’t have that kind of money. My dad isn’t paying for it and neither are “Just wait and see how you feel when you get there.” Alec made it sound like there was something I didn’t know. As much as I wanted to continue tattooing, I wasn’t sure I wanted to be in that location. I

guess if Alec was my mate, I wouldn’t be traveling. That shop might be my get away like it has been. It’s not like I can make a shop on the packs territory as humans and other packs can’t just walk into it. As we pulled up, the yellow caution tape had been removed. People were coming and going, carrying trash with them. “What is all this?” I asked to no one in particular. “Hey, Kristen!” Penny ran up to me. She had a light layer of sweat on her l*p. “Glad you made it. We have at surprise for you!” “We?” I looked at Alec. He leaned against his car as he watched Penny drag me to see. So many people were here, cleaning glass, vacuuming, dusting, tearing down the broken sheetrock and ripping out the bathroom. “These are…” “That’s right. Everyone here is someone you have employed, or helped in some fashion. Here.” Penny handed me a folded piece of paper. Opening it, it was a bank account. There was $6,523.00 in there. “What’s this?” “This is your money. All those times you filled in at the bar and didn’t take your tips. All that work you did for the school and never took the money. They had been giving it to me to save. We all knew of your situation and how bad you wanted to travel. I guess this is a better use for that money.” Words were not forming as I looked between the money and at everyone helping. As they came out, they all said hello. My b*dy jumped when Alec placed his hand on my lower back. “Come inside.” He muttered as he gently pushed me inside. Dust filled the air as the smell of sweat f my nose. The damaged wall was just studs, the bathroom was fully gutted and the floor was about go “Should be finished in a few hours.” Penny smiled. “What do you think?” “… I don’t know what to say.. “Say thank you.” Alec whispered in my ear. “Y-yes, thank you!” It all was surreal. “Where do you want me?”

“Over here.” Penny pulled me back outside and went to her car. “Take these home. These are samples of flooring, wall colors, cabinets everything. I need you to decide what you want so I can order it. Do you want to change the layout?”noveldrama








###Chapter 73

Chapter 0073 “I’ll draw it up.” I said as Alec told all the samples from me. “Perfect. Get it to me as soon as you can. No rush but whenever you can is best.” Penny clapped her hands together and smiled at me. “You are literally the best person.” I said in complete awe. “Anything for you. I owe you so much. It’s at least what I can do.” “You sure you guys don’t need help?” “Nope, just how you want it designed.” “Come on, we can do this at my office.” Alec turned towards his car. “Okay, well… Call me if needed.” “Will do.” Penny waved at me as I started to head to Alec’s car.. “I just…” Sitting in Alecs car, “Kristen, look at me.” It was hard tearing my eyes away.

“Let them take care of it. It’s okay to let someone take care of you.” “It feels wrong.” I shivered as Alec started the car. “Get used to it “He said it a little grumpily. 17” “Why should I?” Crossing my arms, being difficult came naturally to me. “Because I said so.” Short and sweet answers. Direct and to the point. “And what you said goes?” I challenged. “On this matter, yes.” “We’ll see.” I said stubbornly. Alec looked like he was going to say something and just shook his head. I’m not sure why but that instantly made me feel guilty. “What did you guys discuss with Darin and wrecking my shop?” Alecs b*dy stiffened and gripped the steering wheel a little more firmly. “For now, nothing. With as

public bu-” as your birthday will be and the school events, we aren’t going to do anything main “What the hell?” “If you’d let me finish… I was going to say but we are planning on returning the favor. They own a garage in a city over that we will pay a visit to.” And eye for an eye. “That’s not a big enough statement.” I wanted blood. I “Oh, it will be. That garage is a main source of income for that pack. It’s massive. Think of it as a dealership.” “Why did I not know they owned that?” “It’s not anywhere we would go. It’s in a whole other city under an alias. We found out about it years ago. by accident. We were on another mission and stumbled upon it. We have been keeping it a secret to use at the right time. Now, Darin’s attack was directed at you. This attack will possibly start a war.” “I don’t want it a war over me.” “Too late princess. It’s more about the disrespect he showed not only your dad’s pack but mine as well.” “How did it disrespect yours?” “Because even if you don’t accept we are mates till tomorrow, we still are. Making you the future Luna of my pack. We will not stand by as someone disrespects our Luna.” I knew this wasn’t a fight I was going to win but I couldn’t help myself. “It was more of a scare tactic. He wants me, therefore he is showing his dominance. A ‘look what till happen’ kind of thing.” “Good thing we don’t scare easily.” Alec was getting pis sy. “You realize having me for a mate means I will question you if I don’t like what I’m hearing. I won’t be sidelined and I will be heard.” “Oh, I knew that from the moment I met you.”

“When did you start thinking we were mates?” “After I k*ssed you at the club.” We were pulling up to the pack house. People were walking around like normal. A group of guys, including Calvin were standing outside, eating doughnuts. They all watched us get out of the vehicle as Alec carried the samples. “Don’t want to break a nail, Ms. Kristen.” Calvin spouted off. “I’m not the one who should be worried about breaking a nail. Last time I checked, your bi tch as s was notnoveldrama







###Chapter 74

Chapter 0074 Calvin threw down his doughnut as his friends laughed. “Calvin, go run some laps.” Alec was both disappointed and trying not to laugh. “Yes, Alpha.” He mumbled as he took off. We kept going into Alec’s office. “Well, now that you have a knack for encouraging the youth…” Alec sighed. “Technically, I am still the youth. More just speaking to my peers.” I shrugged as I sat down in front of his desk. Alec frowned but didn’t say anything. “Let’s start with the layout.” Alec picked up a scrap paper. He drew out a rectangle and drew the layout as it was. “What do you want to change?” “I want a private office behind the front desk. It would be cheaper to keep the bathroom where it is but make it a tad bigger. I want a separate room for my inks but that doesn’t have to be huge. The sterilization room needs more cabinet space.” “Should you put in another station so you can hire another artist to come in and work? Expand your

business?” That idea never really came to me. “I suppose so. There should be enough room against the west wall to add three stations with half walls. We can add curtains to the top of they wish for privacy.” Alecs phone kept dinging as he was getting messages. Some he answered, some he ignored. My curiosity was burning but it wasn’t any of my business. “Are you happy with this?” There was a knock at this door. Pressing a button, the door buzzed before opening. “Well s hit.” I liked that. “Lunch, Alpha.” A kitchen staff entered and brought in food. “Thank you. Please set it down on the coffee table.” I stood up and walked over to it to see what we were having. As the kitchen staff turned to leave, someone else walked in. “Oh good, that b itch isn’t here. Now we can pick up where we left off at.” Angela walked in wearing anoveldrama

trench coat. The kitchen staffs eyes were huge as she looked between me and Angela. Grabbing some blueberries, I started thinking of all the ways I could handle this. Alec leaned back and smirked. “What are you doing here?” “You told me to come to your office. However, each morning you have been gone or busy so I am finally able to catch you. Do you like what you see?” “I can’t tell, turn around.” I said clearly. I got the satisfaction of watching Angela jump. Quickly, she closed the coat as she glared. “What are you doing here?” She sneered. “Measuring it to figure out where I will be putting my desk after I become your Luna tomorrow. Now, I believe I wanted to see what you were wearing.” My aura shot out and filled around her. Alec just leaned back and watched as I calmly put blueberries in my mouth. Angela was forced to open her cost to reveal the lingerie she was wearing. Anger filled me but I kept it down.” “It seems a little big for you. Don’t fill out the top very well.” I put another blueberry in my mouth. “Alec liked it fine last time.” “Hmm, well let’s see what everyone else thinks.” Walking up to her, I grabbed a fist full of hair and drug her like the dog she was to the group of guys in front of the pack house. Tossing her out, she fell to the ground. “What’s up. Ms. Kristen? Need some help?” They asked as they looked at Angela. “I do actually, she believes she looks good in that lingerie. So good that she thought it was appropriate to show herself to Alpha Alec. What do you guys think?” All of them scowled at her. “What a disgrace.” One boy said, “I feel sorry for whoever you’re mated to. “No one wants a s lut for a mate.” I felt Alec wrap his arm around my waist. “Had enough, Angela?” He boomed.

###Chapter 75

Chapter 0075 “Y-yes, Alpha” “Get some clothes on and go clean out the cells.” Angela ran by me with a tear running down her face. “Thank you, boys.” I said as I turned and walked back up to the office. Alec followed me but this time he locked the office door. “So, where were we?” I was still trying to calm my anger. Alec grabbed my arm and pulled me against the wall where he slammed his b*dy against mine. His l*ps crashed against mine as he k*ssed me deeply. There were faint sparks that covered my face. Pinning both my hands above my head, Alec was hungry. His b*dy was shaking as he pulled his l*ps of “You’re lucky we have stuff to do today.” off mine. “Why so h o rny?” I teased as I looked at him in the eyes. Intentionally, I bit the corner of my l*p before licking them slowly. I had the satisfaction of watching him watch me and feel his b*dy shutter.

“That was so f ucking hot.” “What? Angela’s b*dy you got a good view of?” That was the wrong thing to say. His fist slammed into the wall beside my head. To my credit, I didn’t flinched at all. “Don’t EVER say that again. You are my girl. She is trash.” My eyes didn’t leave his as the anger festered behind them. My hands rested on his chest as I leaned into him. This action confused him as I have never been one to initiate contact. Leaning in, I whispered in his ear, “yes, Alpha.” Before licking his ear. “Damit woman!” Alec pushed away from me and glared. “I’m trying to keep myself off you and you’re going to tease me like that?” “So it’s okay for you to throw me against the wall and have your way but I can’t do the same?” I scolded. My hands were firmly placed on my hips. “Exactly. Sit down so we can continue.” As much as I tried, I couldn’t hide me smile. “Don’t want to eat first?” I left the double meaning in the

air. “Fine. We can eat lunch.” Alec marched to the couch and sat down. With a little more force than needed, he placed our food out. Not wanting to push him too much yet. I just sat and started eating. Soon my mind drifted back to the project. It really was a dream the way this was playing out. I’ve thought a out expanding but never once did! “What are you thinking about?” Alec asked. He was studying me as my attention pulled back to him. “Are you really going to let me continue to tattoo after I become your Luna?” “Kristen, being Luna isn’t a death sentence. It’s a job, a way of life. Think of it as a career. You can still do hobbies. Besides, you said you enjoy being busy. Do you realize how much power you will have here? If you wanted an art studio for teens, you can make that happen. If you want a big as s library, all you have to do is ask. This whole pack will be looking to you to grow their lifestyle. All those projects you did for the school and kids, you get to do on a much bigger scale. You can keep helping people.” Well, when he put it like that… “Oh.” “Is that why you are pushing against this so much?” Alec asked. “I always dreamed of traveling. Seeing what else is out there. Though, anything is better than my dad’s pack. I just want to be able to choose for myself.” “Would you choose traveling over me?” “No. I’m going to explain and I want you to try and understand. I’ve never really said this before to anyone other than Colt. I’ve said pieces, yes but not the whole thing.” Setting my fork down, I sat back. “Growing up in that kind of environment… All I wanted to do was get out. For obvious reasons, staying wasn’t an option. As we got older, everyone always said that Ace would have been my most likely mate. I was told that since I was 11. So it just became natural to spend more time with him. As we got older and my situation got worse… Colt and Ace could only do so much. It became unbearable around when I was 14. My arm got broken. I could have tested out of high school but that meant doing online

college classes and more time with An n. So, I opt to stay and go to high school. Each time Ace or Colt failed to protect me, my dreams of traveling grew. I started saving my money and opened the tattoo shop. It got to the point I started seriously questioning my desire to be mated to Ace. If I was with him, I would have left him to travel. Without a doubt. Being mates to him meant staying and living with An n. After I met you, I realized there might be a life for me that doesn’t include staying there. That doesn’t mean my dream of traveling is gone but the thought of being able to live somewhere I don’t have to look over my shoulder is what I am after. You provide that here. I think I’ll be happy here, as long as I can still be me and still tattoo, but I still want to travel and see the world.”noveldrama






###Chapter 76

Chapter 0076 “So this is your safe option.” Alec sounded hurt. “Yes and no. Yes, you make me feel safe. I am comfortable here. I like it here. YOU are not a safe option. You mean vulnerabilities. You have the power to hurt me, me ntally, emotionally, and physically. I’m scared. to be mated because you will feel all my insecurities, my weaknesses and my fears. To me, you are the unknown and my head is screaming to run but my heart wants to stay. To give you that power over me and trust you won’t break it.” “You’re scared to be loved.” “Sometimes, love isn’t enough. Dad loves me and it wasn’t enough. Colt loves me and it wasn’t enough. Ace loved me and now he’s dead. What if you love me someday and it gets you killed too. I’m not worth that.” Alec was quiet for a minute before getting up and literally picked me up and took me to the couch. He placed me on his lap, tucking my feet under his legs so I couldn’t move. “You are very worthy of love. I wish you could see how great your heart is, I know I can’t convince you of anything right now but after tomorrow, I will be spending my days making sure you know just how loved you are.” Alec cupped my face as he gave me the softest k*ss before pulling me into a hug. I fit so perfectly against his chest that I was able to snuggle into him easily. “Should we keep working on the design?” “Sure.” I wasn’t ready to get up but I did after he released my feet. Alec grabbed the books and brought

them to the coffee table so we could keep eating. “What do you want for flooring?” I “Well, I want a light olive or sage green on my walls. Not too dark flooring but maybe more gray than brown?” “Something like this?” Alec pulled out something that was kind of what I was thinking.

“That is too shiny. I don’t want anything to show dust easily or show scratches.” “This?” Alec pulled out something very gray with a hint of brown. It had like build in scrapes that would. hide any scratches. “I love that, how much is that per square feet?” “Don’t worry about it. Everything here is within your budget. Even if you pick the most expensive stuff, it will all be covered. Penny is truly gifted. No wonder she was your assistant.” “I have a knack for choosing the right person for the job.” “What are you thinking about?” Alec asked. He was studying me as my attention pulled back to him. “Are you really going to let me continue to tattoo after I become your Luna?” “Kristen, being Luna isn’t a death sentence. It’s a job, a way of life. Think of it as a career. You can still do hobbies. Besides, you said you enjoy being busy. Do you realize how much power you will have here? If you wanted an art studio for teens, you can make that happen. If you want a big as s library, all you have to do is ask. This whole pack will be looking to you to grow their lifestyle.

###Chapter 77

Chapter 0077 “Do you have Penny’s contact information?” “I gave it to him.” Emmy said quickly. Looking between the two, I knew something was up. “Want to tell me what you’re hiding?” I asked them “Don’t do that! I want to go swimming!” Emmy even stomped her foot at me. “Calm down there. I don’t have a suit.” “I got one for you!” Emmy held up a bag. Eyeing her suspiciously she rolled her eyes and grabbed my arm. “Just come on.” “Have fun!” Jasper called after us. “Help!” I faked being kidnapped but all Alec did was smirk. “Come on! It will be fun!”

We went into her bedroom to change. “Here is yours…” She tossed me a skimpy looking thing. When I got it on, it had good support for my boobs but cleavage was on full display. My as s was sticking out but that is the style I guess. Emmy had on a basic string bikini. Hers was neon yellow and mine was black. “Jasper approved of that?” “Um, no but I got my way regardless” She laughed. “Nice, got towels?” “Right here! Let’s go!” She tossed me a cover, which looked like an oversized t-shirt and fl*p flops before heading out. “Where is this pool?” “Down the road. It’s a public pool.” noveldrama

“Wonderful.” I said sarcastically as we got into the golf cart. Emmy drove like a mad person. Making me cling on for deal life. 1 “I’m driving on the way back.” I muttered as I basically fell out of the cart. “Don’t be so dramatic!” Emmy rolled her eyes and signed. “Jasper won’t let me drive again if you act like that.” “Now bathroom fixtures.” Alec ignored my question. “That vanity, with that shower. Same floor as the rest of the place. I want that mirror too. Put the same cabinets in the sterilization room and in my office. Top and bottom cabinets.” “Well s hit. Okay.” I pointed to a similar style vanity as my basic straight lines cabinets. It was a dark blue color and the shower was black metal frame with glass doors. “I like what I like.” I shrugged as I had just finished eating. The office door opened and Emmy and Jasper came in. “How’s it going?” Emmy asked. “Just finished designing my shop!” I said with a smile. “Good. Let’s go lay out by the pool.” “Perfect. You girls do that. I will get this sent over to Penny and Jasper and I have some work we need to do but then we will catch up for supper.” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! 






###Chapter 78

Chapter 0078 “Poor kid. Maybe I’ll be giving him a job.” “He’s good with drawings. You should look at his art work.” I “I might just do that.” I could use someone to clean the shop. If this is really my home, I have a lot of money saved up I can use to help him out. After that no one else came up to talk to us. I saw a few girls look over but no one came up. I was honestly disappointed in that. At my dad’s pack, people always came over and said hello to me. Maybe they are scared or nervous? I guess some Luna’s may not want people to talk to them but that wasn’t me. “Oh, time to go!” Emmy said as she looked at her phone. “Boys not coming here?” “Nope, we are going to them… Kinda.” “Kinda?” “We need to shower and get ready, they have a date for us.”

“Ah, so all this was to get me out of the house so they could prepare.” “Don’t act surprised. You saw this coming a mile away. “I did.” Laughing we got into the cart. “Drive slower.” I said to warn Emmy. “Yeah, yeah” She rolled her eyes but did drive slower and much better. Which was good because Jasper was outside when we got there. “How did she drive?” He asked me “My lunch stayed down!” I joked as I ran inside. “Traitor!” Emmy yelled. I blew her a k*ss before disappearing inside. I ran the whole way up to the bedroom, just in time to see Alec sl*p his shirt on. “Hey!” I said slamming the noveldrama

door shut. “What’s the rush?” “Had to get away from Emmy. I ratted her out to Jasper. She is a terrible driver!” I laughed as I went to my bag. It was empty. “Where are my clothes?” “In the closet, where they belong.” Alec shrugged like it was no big deal. Standing up, I walked into the closet to see my entire closet in his. “The f uck?” “Colt did it. He had help bringing all your things over here so you didn’t have to spend more time there. I had a maid come put it all up.” I had some mixed emotions. On one hand, I was happy I didn’t have to do it. On the other, it felt so forced. “Oh.” “Do you not like it?” Alec asked. “… No, I mean yes, it’s just, it could, may….. Yes, thank you.” I stumbled a bit before just saying thank you. “This overwhelmed you.” Alec concluded. “Yes. “You may not have faith we are mates but I do.” Alec was upset. He turned around and walked out of the bedroom. My heart sank as the regret filled me. I felt horrible. Grabbing my clothes, I got in the shower. The hot water turned my skin red. In shame? Possibly. sl As soon as I was done, I got out and got dressed. I put a cute dress on and did my hair and makeup. Nothing crazy but I tried to look good for Alec. Putting on my sandals, I went to go look for him. He

wasn’t I in his office or the lobby. Going to Emmy and Jaspers room I knocked. “Looking good!” Emmy answered. “Is Alec in here?” “No, is he not with you?” Emmy said. “No. Can you link him and find out?” “Sure. What happened?” Jasper answered. “He moved all my clothes into his closet.” “Ah, yeah that probably didn’t go over well.” Emmy frowned as she looked at me. “What? Why?” Jasper was confused.







###Chapter 79

Chapter 0079 He stopped the swing long enough for me to get on before he started up again. “I’m sorry. You did. something sweet and I didn’t react correctly. I do appreciate what you did for me.” Looping my arm around his, I just laid my head on his shoulder. Still, Alec didn’t move or say anything. “Alec, please? I say anything. Sighing, I really am sorry he didn’t stopped the swing and got off. Leaning over, I gave him a k*ss on the cheek before turning to leave. Tears filled my eyes as Emmy and Jasper came out. “Kristen?” “You guys have fun. I’m going to go for a walk. Going down the steps, I just started walking. I could hear them. “What the f uck, Alec? Jasper asked. “Alec, you can’t be serious? She has already given so much of herself. More than she has ever given anyone and you are going to let this stop you from tonight?” Emmy started in. I deserved it. It was so hard for me to open up and here I am, ruining everything that was good in my life. I just walked. The sun was setting and most people were inside eating so I was alone.

There was a little park was just inviting me. Sitting on one of the swings, I let the warm breeze push me. I guess I planned on moving out tomorrow anyway, just didn’t think it would be here. Footsteps slowly started approaching. My heart sank for the second time as it was Emmy, not Alec that came and found me. “Hey girl.”

“Well, I did it this time.” I gave her a sad smile as she sat down, Reaching out, she held my hand. “I get why it’s hard for you but he has been trying.” “I know. I have been too.” “No one sees that more than me.” “He doesn’t want to hear my apology.” I sighed. “He heard you, he just wasn’t ready to move on.” “On the brink bright side, this birthday won’t be any worse than the last ones.” “Give him time, he will come around.” “Before or after tomorrow?” I looked at her. “I think before.” Emmy gave me a smile before looking behind me.. Following her eyes, Alec was walking up to me. Emmy got up and gave me a huge. “Thank you.” I whispered. “Just let him in. He loves you.” Her words echoed in my ears as she smiled and left. Alec sat down but didn’t say anything. I felt like a dam n child, waiting for my dad to start yelling at me again. “If you want to hear me say sorry again, I will.” I finally broke the silence. “Come here.” Alec pushed my arm with his finger tips. Standing up, I nervously walked up to him. Alec opened his legs and sat me down on his lap. Wrapping my arm around his neck, I laid my head on his shoulder. “I’m sorry.” I whispered again. “I just am afraid.” “Of what?” “How much power you have over me.” “Hmm.” “You have done nothing but show me kindness and how much you care about me. I know I haven’t given you want you want exactly but I’ve allowed you inside my heart. It may not seems like a lot to younoveldrama

but you are tearing down my walls. You have this power over me. Constantly on my mind. My b*dy aches for you. I’m sorry if I haven’t given you enough.” “Don’t that. It’s not that it’s not enough. It’s the fact you have little confidence in us being mates.” “That’s not true. I actually have a bet over us.” “What?” “I ran into Calvin at the pool. He was being himself so I made a bet. He owes me 100 pushups if we are mates.” “Seriously?” “Yup.” “Betting is against the rules,” “Want to sp ank me?” “Get off.” Alec playfully pushed me off him but he stood up and grabbed my hand. “Where are we going?”







###Chapter 80

Chapter 0080 “To eat a cold supper.” Η “Okay.” We walked in silence. There was a golf cart in front of the pack house that we got into. Alec drove past some houses and into the country. As we came over a hill, there was a cluster of lights ahead. The lightening bugs were out, leading us the whole way. As we pulled up, there was a bed of blankets on the ground with pillows and trays with food. “This looks amazing!” I said maybe a little too perky. Alec gave me a look. “Just be yourself.” “You got mad at me for being myself tonight.” I muttered as I got out. Alec froze for a second before coming around and k*ssing my forehead.

Taking my hand, he pulled me towards the blankets. “I hope you like cold pasta.” “I’m sure it will be just fine. Thank you for doing this.” We sat down and Alec dished us up a plate. Taking a bite of the chicken Alfredo was not the greatest but I didn’t complain. “I can’t take you on a tropical vacation for your birthday or to the mountains. This is the best I was able to come up with.” “This is perfect. I don’t need anything fancy or expensive. I just need something from the heart. This is actually really perfect.” It still felt a little awkward but it was getting better. We both only ate half of the food before putting it down and setting it off to the side. “Where did Emmy and Jasper go?” I asked as we laid down. Alec wrapped his arm under my head so my head was on his chest. It was still warm enough we didn’t need a blanket but I grabbed one anyway and wrapped it around

my leg. “He set up his own date with her. She was under the impression it was a double date so.. “Ah, I wouldn’t have wrecked their night regardless.” Alec put his finger under my chin and tilted my face up. “I’m sorry too.” Giving him a soft k*ss, I sank back down to his chest. “When do we have to be back?” “We don’t “Alec said. He was looking up at the stars. “There is the big dipper. “Full moon tonight too.” I was so relaxed. I caught a glimpse of his phone. It said 11:24pm. 36 more “Are you going to wear the red dress tomorrow?” “Yes, I am.” “Good.” Alec rotated us so I was under him as he covered me. His hand came up and cupped my face. His eyes had a million words but nothing came out. Instead he placed a soft k*ss to my l*ps. Gradually, it deepened as Alec pressed his stiffened d ick into me. “If you don’t want to, we can stop here and now.” Alec stopped k*ssing me and looked into my eyes. “Touch me.” It almost was a beg. That was all it took for Alec to slammed his l*ps against mine. His hand moved my dress up and off my b*dy in one swift motion. Alec looked over me b*dy. My matching white lacy bra and panties make a deep growl rumble his chest as his mouth latched to my nipple. “Oh!” I moaned as he played with the other. F uck I’ve wanted this. Grabbing his shirt, I make sure to take it off as he kept sucking on my ti t. I wanted the feel of his skin against mine. Alec’s hungry movements slowed down as he made his way back up. “F uck, I want you so bad.” He whispered in my ear. “So take me.” “As s soon as the bond snaps into place, my di ck is going to be ramming into you.” It was a promise as he hand cupped my pus sy. “Spread those legs for me.”

It was as if my b*dy acted on it’s own. A let’s parted as he moved my panties to the side and stuck a finger in. This thumb played with my cl it, making me squirm. “Oh, Alec!” I moaned as my nails dug into the blankets.noveldrama







###Chapter 81

Chapter 0081 Yes, my love?” I didn’t even have a change to respond before his tongue slowly slid down my c lit. Alec grabbed my panties and pulled them off. His tongue went back to work, sucking on my c lit. The wave of pleasure was building quickly. “Oh f u ck! Alec!” I screamed as it hit full force. My b*dy clenched around Alec’s fingers but his tongue never let up. “Oh! Oh! Oh!” I moaned as he continued the assault. Making a second or gasm hit within seconds. My entire b*dy was shaking under his touch. Alec moved back up and let me taste myself on him. Wanting to give back, I fl*pped him over so I was on top. I’ve wanted to trace these muscle since my eyes laid on them. His hands rested on my hips as I started with his neck. There was a spot, just behind his ear that made his b*dy tense under me. His nailed dug into me but not enough to draw blood. Moving down, I had to keep my hair out of my face. Alec wrapped it around his hand and held on. The lower I moved, the tighter his gripe. 2 My tongue grazed his shorts and his hips buckled. The bulge in his pants had me worried but this is what I wanted. As soon as his pants lowered enough to free it, the massive 9 inch c ock stood in front of me. Keeping eye contact, my tongue started at the base and moved upward. Slowly I watched his eyes roll in the back of his head and his b*dy shudder. A deep grown vibrated his chest as I shoved his d ck deep down my throat. With no gag reflex, all 9 inches went in easily. noveldrama

“Holy f uc k!” Alec moaned as he helped move my head up and down. I saw it in a movie once, a girl played with his balls, so I tried it. Cupping them, I just massaged them and to my delight, he came unglued. Moving my head faster, his b*dy stiffened as he shot his load down my throat. I kept going until he finally released my head. Sitting up, my hair was tossed to the side, I tried to look seductive as I cleaned my l*ps with one finger before sticking it in my mouth, cleaning it off. Alec watched every movement with an open jaw.

Wanting to keep it going, I reached around and unhooked my bra. Letting fall, I bit my l*p to really get him going. His d ick was already hard as I tossed it to the side. Crawling up to his face, he crushed his l*ps against mine. “Dam n woman.” Alec muttered as he rolled me to the side and then on my stomach. Moving my hair, Alec started k*ssing the back of my neck. Sparks erupted everywhere he touched my back arched, making my as s rub up against him. Claws gently grinded down my side, leaving goosebumps in it’s wake. Teeth playfully nibbled my sides as he got lower until his hands grabbed my as s cheeks. The sparks were overwhelming. “Alec!” His phone said 12:04am. It was my birthday and the sparks told me what I needed to know. “Turn around.” Alec whispered in my ear. Rolling over, I kept my eyes shut. My already fast beating heart took off. Alec laid on top of me. My legs wrapped around his waist and he had my hands pinned above me. “Open your eyes, beautiful.” “You sure?” I said in a shaky voice. “Very.” The moment our eyes locked, the bond snapped into place. The air on my lungs evaporated right before his d ick plunged into me. My b*dy clenched around him as he paused, waiting for me to adjust. I “I’m sorry.” Alec licked away the tear that escaped as I clung to him for my life. “Relax. It’ll feel good in a second.” The hot pain slowly faded as he pulled out and pushed back in. “Oh f uck you’re tight “He muttered as he continued to hold back so I could adjust. “I’m okay.” I said as my shaking hands cupped his face. “Are you?” The concern I felt through the bond was overwhelming. He truly cared about me.







###Chapter 82

Chapter 0082 y-yes. “Y-yes.” Words were starting to get hard to say. Slowly the pain faded and was replaced by pleasure. When Alec felt my b*dy relax, he moved faster. “I don’t think I can hold on much longer.” Alec said in a strained voice. He was moving faster but it was still a steady lower rhythm. “Oh!” I felt the pressure start to build up again. Alec started k*ssing my neck and down to an extra sensitive spot on my collar bone. “Alec!” My need for him was so strong. “Hold on” Tightening my legs around him, Alec picked me up and moved us so we were sitting up with me straddling him. My hips moved on their own as I rode him more forcefully than he pumped into me. His hand firmly gripped my hips, helping me keep rhythm. I felt an overwhelming urge to bite him. My fangs descended. Alec saw this, “do it.” Glancing at him, he pulled me towards him, for support for who, I wasn’t sure. Kissing the spot, I felt him shiver under me, a second later my teeth sank into his skin until I hit bone. Alec let out a deep growl as he bear hugged me. His breathing was rapid but kept us moving. Slowly, my fangs retracted and I licked his wounds clean. Alec pulled my head back and k*ssed me passionately. I felt so connected to him. “I’m about to explode.” Alec warned.

“F uck me hard.” I whispered in his ear. Alec pulled me back and searched for any sighs of pain before he dropped me on my back and stated pounding away. The sound of skin hitting skin echoed in the valley as my pressure built up. “F uck! Alec!” I moaned. My ti ts were bouncing up and down as he showed no mercy. I watched his fangs descended, moving my hair, I gave him access. My nerves shot up and he laid down on top of me. “Kristen….” Alec voice was full of concern. “Do it! Please!” I begged as the pressure was at a tipping point.

“Look at me.” His voice sounded almost painful. Opening my eyes, he was looking between me and my neck. “Alec…” “I love you.” He said and then bit down on my neck, hitting bone. My scream sent the birds flying as both of our or ga sms hit at the same time. A deep growl vibrated Alecs chest as the final part of the bond sealed. Alec let me go, and cleaned the wound. My b*dy was numb as darkness threatened to take over. “Don’t fight it. Just pass out. I’ll be here when you wake up. I love you.” Alec whispered in my ear. “Love y-” is all u got out before the world went black. My hearing came first, the sounds of birds filled the air with their happy chirping. Then came the sparks that covered my b*dy. It was like my b*dy was tingling but it felt good. “You awake?” Alec’s voice whispered in my ear. “No.” Rolling over, I kept my face buried in his chest. “Happy birthday.” “Thank you. “We probably need to head back. There is a birthday breakfast for you.” Alec was gently rubbing my back. Peaking through my eyelashes, the sun was peaking through the trees. “It’s too early for breakfast “Your dad and brother are coming over. Do you want to smell like S** when they get here?” That did the trick Wiggling away from him, I sat up and looked for my clothes. “Where did my clothes go?” “Right here.” Alec handed me my clothes. I felt a little awkward getting dressed in front of him but afte my internal battle, this was something I needed to get used to. Putting my bra on first, then I sl*pped my panties on and finally my dress. “We should take all this with us.” “Leave it. When you girls start getting ready for tonight, Jasper and I are coming out to get it.” “That seems wrong.” noveldrama

###Chapter 0083

"Jasper did this whole set up for Emmy?"

"No. He did his own thing, I meant I helped clean up afterwards. If anything, Colt helped me plan this." "Oh.. that's weird."

Alec gathered what he needed and we got back on the golf cart. "You have some amazing hair right now."

"That's really your own fault for wrapping your fingers through it." I scolded but still tried to tame it. "Ah, yes but it was worth it."

"Was it?" I asked as I felt a little insecure.

"Why do you feel insecure about last night?"

My jaw dropped as I forgot he can feel my emotions and me his. I got a wave of humor flood and but this time I was able to realize it wasn't my humor but Alecs.

"It was my first time." Crossing my arms, I looked away from him.noveldrama

Alec reached over and pulled me towards him in the beach seat. He placed his hand on the inside of my thigh, holding my leg against his. Wrapping my arm around his, my head rested against his shoulder.

"We have brunch and then Emmy has girl stuff for you guys and then the dance. We need to be there around 5:30," Alec filled me in.

Disappointed he didn't answer or I guess respond to my statement, I was just going to let it go, "Sounds good." "What are you disappointed for?"

"I'm really going to hate this emotion sharing thing." I sighed. Alec smirked and kissed my forehead. "So?"

"You didn't comment on what I said about it being my first time. Obviously you knew what you were doing." Alec slammed on the break. If it wasn't for his hand, I would have been tossed out. "Listen here." Alec picked me up and moved me so I was straddling his lap. "I have never felt so alive, last night was the best night in my entire life. I love you, Kristen. I've never felt this way about anyone. You are my life, my world. Don't ever doubt that." Alec kissed me passionately as I felt all the love come from him.

When he finally pulled back I was able to see all the love in his eyes. "I love you too." I whispered. It was both painful and wonderful to be able to say that and mean it.

"Hmm, I heard that's hard for you to say..."

"It is." Alec kissed me sweetly before allowing me to slip next to him again. Putting his hand back on my thigh, we drove back to the pack house.

To my pleasure, no one was around to witness my walk of shame. Alec took his sweet ass time but I ran ahead. Unfortunately I didn't have the code to unlock it.

"2430" Alec said in my mind. His voice was more sexy in my head.

"Do you want to shower first or me?" I asked.

"Don't want to shower together?" Alec said playfully as we walked inside. Alec shut the door and locked it.

"That's an interesting idea..." One that made me nervous as hell. I was still sore from last night but I told myself I would drop the awkwardness and that means taking a shower with your mate. "I hope you like boiling water"

Thankfully, Alec didn't comment on my internal battle. "Does it have to be boiling?" Walking straight to the bathroom, Alec grabbed towels while I turned the shower on. Since he hadn't come into the bathroom yet. I very quickly got undressed and jumped in before he saw me. Which is juvenile but oh well. Thankfully, the water was hot and I was able to be under it for a second before I heard Alec step in.

"Seriously?"

"What? It feels good." I was standing there, in all my naked glory with my eyes closed. The water was hitting the top of my head and falling down.

"I know something else that feels good." His hands gripped my hips and pulled me to him. The cold air hardened my nipples as his dick pressed into me.







###Chapter 0084

Instantly, my eyes opened. Alec leaned down to kiss me but I swerved out of the way. "Whoa!"

"What?" Alec felt a little hurt by that.

"Your mark! I mean, our mark. It's so cool looking." I knew Alec was watching me as I traced over. It was a full black moon with a design in the middle.

Alec had his arms around my waist, keeping me pressed up against him as I studied it. It was truly unique. Alec's had a design on his that looked like an abstract A. Mine was more like an L.

"Have yo" I looked up at Alec and my words were caught in my throat. His eyes were black as his wolf had come forward. "Hey." I said in a whisper.noveldrama

Alec closed his eyes and when he opened them up, they were back to normal. Without speaking, he picked up my shampoo and started massaging it in. My eyes rolled back as my head did a little. It felt amazing. I had to wrap my arm around his waist to keep me upright. I felt the desire shoot through me from Alec. He found it sexy.

Wanting to taunt him, I added a moan. "Hmm, that feels good." It worked as I felt his body shudder but he didn't stop. Instead he put me under the water and rinsed it out. Next was the conditioner. Taking my fingernails, they gently ranked down his back. Letting out a soft moan as I bit my lip was about all he could take. Pushing me against the wall, my eyes opened.

"Like to tease?"

"No teasing, fuck me, Alec." My hand slipped between us as I started stroking him.

"My little vixen." His finger started rubbing my clit as I placed my leg around his waist.

I was already wet and ready to go. The need was so strong that I just shoved his hand away and pulled his dick to me. "Please?"

That's all it took for Alec to shove his dick into me. "Ah, fuck!" Alec said in a deep growl voice.

"Ahh!" My body tighten around him but it didn't hurt long. Only a few seconds and the pleasure started building." Harder!" I put my hands on his shoulders as my hips makes his thrust.

"Fuck, woman." Alec growled as he watched my tits bounce up and down.

"OH!" My orgasm hit as his did, leaving up both panting. "Thanks." I said Patting his shoulder.

"Thanks?"

"Giving me what I wanted. I like it hard." Grabbing the soap, I cleaned my body as Alec cleaned his. There was still a little blood on his dick I noticed.

"I see that."

"Do you not?"

"Oh, I do. Very much so." He whispered in my ear so I stepped out of the shower. He smacked my ass on the way. "Good." After towel drying, I went to the closet to find something to wear. Grabbing a cotton dress and sneakers, I was braiding my hair when Alec came into the closet.

"You got dressed quickly."

"I'm actually looking forward to today!"

"Why's that?" Alec smiled as he got dressed.

"It's going to be a great birthday. I can tell " "Good. I'm glad you are happy " "Extremely."

"Can you grab something for me off that dresser?" Alec looked over to the one behind me.

"Sure, what do you want?" I asked walking up to it. There was a small rectangle box that had a card on top. It said, ' Happy Birthday!' picking it up, I looked at Alec.

"Open it."

I was still in complete shock. Opening the card, it read, 'Kristen, you captured my heart before you were even mine. Your beauty shines in more than your pretty face. Please wear this as a symbol of just that.'

Opening the box. The tiniest little diamond sat on a halo by itself. The dainty chain made the chain stop right at the base of my neck, between my collar bones.

"This is beautiful." I said breathlessly.

"I didn't have help either." Alec came over and helped me put it on. "Do you like it."







###Chapter 85

Chapter 0085 “I really do. Thank you.” Turning, I flung my arms around him. He hugged me tightly for a few seconds before letting me go. “We better get moving, your brunch starts in five minutes “Okay.” We headed to the door and down to the kitchen. “I’m going to need to go to your office after this and call Calvin in there. He owes me 100 pushups.” “You were serious about that?” Alec laughed. “Of course!” We walked into the formal dining room to everyone yelling happy birthday! “Thanks!” I said to everyone but I ran up to Colt and gave him a big hug. “I’m so happy for you, sis.” He whispered in my ear. “Thank you. Have you found your mate yet?” “No but it isn’t Kara. I saw her earlier and she ran away crying.” Colt said as he let go of me and shook Alec’s hand. Dad came over and hugged me before shaking Alecs hand as well. Even Alec’s parents were there. “Welcome to the family.” Alpha Marc said to me as he shook Alec’s hand. “Thank you! I’m happy to be part of this pack. noveldrama

“Let me see it!” Emmy squealed. Pulling my dress to the side, I showed them my mark. “Nice!” Colt said. “Pretty!” Emmy yelled before pulling me to the table.”I’m starving so can we eat?” “Of course!” Everyone sat down around the table. There were different foods that really made my stomach growl. I grabbed a chicken Caesar salad and water. “How’s the decorations coming along?” I asked dad. “Well, I had to call Penny over since you weren’t available. She has got it down.” Colt answered for dad. “Ah, she is amazing.” I agreed.

“I’ll go down there after this and make sure it’s looking good.” Dad followed up. “I see you had some people help clean your shop.” Alpha Marc said to me. “Alec and Colt organized that but yes, they got it cleaned out. We picked the design yesterday.” I answered. “Should be ready in a week or so.” Alec nodded. “That’s good to hear!” Alpha Marc said a little too cheerful. Looking around, everyone was looking a little too chipper. Their smiles seemed a tad too big. “Damit.” Alec muttered. “What is going on here?” I asked the room. “What do you mean?” Colt asked. My eyes zeroed in on him. “Cut the c rap, what happened?” Colt sighed. “Told you, man.” He said to Alec. “I know.” Alec let go of the breath he was holding and turned to look at me. “Darin and the ranking wolves. will be there tonight. He has requested a song to dance with you on.” My heart sank to my stomach. “So, you all thought you would keep that to yourself?” I looked at each one of them. “Just until after lunch. I was going to tell you before your massage.” Emmy looked ashamed. “I don’t have to do it, do I?” I looked at Alec. “No, you don’t.” He responded forcefully. That helped but my stomach still felt uneasy. “We are trying to keep appearances up…” Dad started. I knew what that meant. Play nice till we strike. Acceptance filled me as I stabbed more salad and shoved it into my mouth. “Kristen..” Alec reached and and started running my back. 1 Oddly, it did help calm me. “It’s fine. I’ll do it.” “Ice, yo-” Colt started. “I said it’s fine. Move on.” I snapped. I instantly felt bad. “Excuse me.” Standing up, I walked quickly out

of the kitchen and into the hall bathroom. Taking a deep breath, I worked on calming my nerves. “Kristen?” Alec was on the other side. “Come in.” I was resting my hands on the vanity and looking at myself in the mirror. Alec opened the door but didn’t make a move to touch me. Instead, he leaned against the wall. “Are you okay?” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!! 6







###Chapter 86

Chapter 0086 “No, Alec I’m not.” “I’m not happy about this either. I have it in me t-” “No Alec. I’m not okay because everyone thinks they need to keep s hit from me. I’m a big f ucking girl and Luna of this pack. Mates don’t keep secrets. You had no right to keep that from me. We are supposed to be equals! I expect that from them but not from you.” Alec took the as s chewing and had the decency to look ashamed. “You’re right. I’m sorry.” Alec walked in and rubbed his hands up and down my arms. He stood behind me as I glared at him in the mirror. “I want to protect you.” I “There are some things you cannot protect me from.” I responded as I calmed down. know. I’ll try to remember that.” Turning around, Alec wrapped me in a hug. “I’m still mad at you.” I mumbled but my anger was fading. “I know.” Pulling my face up to him, he k*ssed me softly. “Ready to go back out there?” “Yeah.” Alec closed the door behind us. We were holding hands as we walked back into brunch. Thankfully they moved on and was talking about what moving forward would look like. “Have you found a new beta?” Alpha Marc asked.

“Probably will move Jacob up but that will be a conversation. He Colt sighed. Would need to change his ways a little.” “Hopefully you find your mate tonight.” Dad sighed. It wasn’t unheard of to take over the Alpha role without one but it made you stronger. “Hope so.” Colt gave me a look. It was, now the pressure is on me kind of look. I responded with a smirk

of my own. “Are you going to come finish packing your room?” Colt asked. “Probably should. There isn’t too much I want to bring but there are some stuff.” “I’m just telling you now, An n is dead set on making it into a guest room asap so anything left behind will be thrown away.” Colt warned me. “Do I have time to get it after we eat?” I asked Alec. “Of course. We can go afterwards. Can’t spend a lot of time over there but it’s your birthday, you can do whatever you want.” I could tell Alec didn’t want to go over there but he also didn’t want me to not have my stuff. “I’ll tag along. That way I can make sure to keep anything you don’t want to bring over here but don’t want An n to throw away.” Colt stated. Alecs phone started vibrating. He glanced at it before standing up and walking out of the room. My eyes followed him as he answered the phone. “Is Alec okay with that?” Colt asked. “He’s fine. He just doesn’t like A nn.” I shrugged. “No one does.” Emmy muttered b efore looking shocked by her comment. “I’m so sorry! It sl*pped.” Marc shook his head but the rest of us laughed. “It’s okay, girl. You saw first hand how she is.” “What’s so funny?” Alec asked as he walked back in. “Emmy.” I said as I took another bite. “Penny is going to meet us at the pack house. I guess we missed something she needs.” “On what?” I asked. “The shop.” “Why is she working on the shop and the party?” I asked appalled. “Because that woman is gifted.” Alec nodded. “Very much so. I better never lose her.) noveldrama

“Penny has worked under you, learned from you for almost 4 years now.” Colt commented “Yup, she just needed some guidance.” I agreed. “That didn’t make you jealous Alec said that about Penny?” Emmy asked. The bite of food I was about to eat hung in the air. “Nnooo?” I looked at Alec for an answer. “You really aren’t the jealous type.” Colt answered. “I guess he hasn’t given me a reason to be jealous? I don’t know. I guess I never really thought about it.” I “Well don’t start.” Alcaid and we all laughed “Why?” I asked Emmy the opened and closed her mouth a few times. “She gets jealous over the littlest thing if I’m talking to a pack member over the menu Jasper said as he rubbed her back







###Chapter 87

“Jealousy is a normal thing for wolves. We are very territorial and I’m more worried she isn’t jealous.”

Marc chimed in.

“Jasper just needs to make sure you feel comfortable. Like if he is talking to a member, pull her into the

conversation or ask her opinion.” I said looking at him.

“You could be more jealous too.” Alec joked.

“Keep dreaming.” Rolling my eyes, I had finished my meal. The room chuckled as we all leaned back.

“Ready to get your stuff? I got stuff to do today.” Colt looked at his watch.

“Like what? It’s your birthday too.”

“But I’m a man and future alpha. I don’t get a relaxing day of pampering like you.”

“Sometimes being a girl pays off.” Emmy whispered. I held up my fist and she bumped it.

“Let’s go.” Alec stood up. Following his lead, we made our way to the cars. “Do I need a pick up?”

“No. I don’t own anything that big.”

“Let’s take the convertible.” Alec smirked as he unlocked his cherry red Corvette.

“Hell yeah!” Jumping in, I was ready for this. Alec started the car as I sat up on the back of the seat. Flooring it, we lead the way. It felt amazing having the wind in my hair. I sat like that the whole drive so

when we got there, my hair was crazy looking.

“That looks like a rats nest!” Colt joked.

“Yeah, I’ll fix it up there.” I tried to look at it but there wasn’t much hope. “Totally worth it

Going inside, Alec was very stiff. He kept his hand around my waist as we walked up the stairs. It wasn’t until we were in my old room that he relaxed.

“So what do you want?” Colt asked.

“My sketches. My jewelry box.” Grabbing two pictures of the wall, I held them close. One was of my mother holding me as a baby before she died and the other was dad, Colt and I at the park. He was bear hugging us. Both of us had huge smiles on our faces.

Setting them in the coffee table, I went into the bathroom. To fix my hair and to get my bathroom stuff.

Thankfully I had a good size bag to put it all.

There was a knock on the door. Walking out, I just made it to witness Penny walk in and look right at Colt. Both of them whispered Mate before Penny dropped everything and ran into Colt’s arms.

Alec smirked but when he saw my face, he walked up to me. “What’s wrong?” He asked in the mind link.

“People usually mate within their rank or close to it.”

“Yeah?”

“Penny was an orphan when I hired her.” Alec finally got my drift as we watched them make out. His hands rubbed up and down my back as a bad feeling came over me. I loved Penny but since we didn’t

know where she came from…

Finally, they let each other go. Penny had tears in her eyes. “Kris?”

Snapping out of it, I smiled and walked over to give her a hug. “I’m so happy for you! You will be a great Luna”

“Thank you. I never expected this.” Penny smiled at Colt.

“Do you think you could show Alec the questions you had? I need to ask Colt about what pictures he

wants and which ones I want to take.”

“Of course!” Penny and Alec walked over to the door and Colt followed me into the empty closet.

“Ice?” Colt asked

“First, I am so happy for you. Penny will truly be an amazing Luna.”

“But…”noveldrama

“You will need to find out where she is from. When I hired her, she was an orphan. People mate within their rank, Colt. What pack abandoned a ranking wolf’s daughter?”

“You don’t think I should mate her?”

“The exact opposite. You need to mark her asap. Before tonight. That way we can protect her at all costs.

She deserves to be treated like a queen.

“Maybe you’re right.” Colt agreed.

“I couldn’t have picked a better mate for you. You two will be truly a great couple. If you mate her before anyone finds out, they can’t do anything about it. They can’t take her back.”









###Chapter 88

“Colt?” Penny’s voice came from the other side of the door. Colt grabbed the box of photos and walked out. “What’s wrong? You seemed really concerned.”

“Just thinking about the party tonight.” Colt said.

“It is looking really good!” Penny smiled.

“I have no doubt. You do amazing work.” I smiled at her. I left them to talk as I gathered anything else I wanted to take. Colt a put a box in front of my bookcase. Piling in my books, I knew Alec was going to

have to carry this one.

“What else?” Alec asked as he moved the box to the door.

“I think that’s it.” Looking around, there wasn’t much left. I always knew I was going to be moving so I

didn’t keep stuff.

Alec cupped my face my face. “You okay?” He knew what I felt but he also knew I didn’t like he he used them without asking or waiting for me to tell him.

“Yeah. Just….I realized I never really created much of a base here. I always knew this was temporary all my possessions fit in my arms.”

“We will build a life together.” Alec gave me a soft k*ss.

“You two are so cute together.” Looking over, Colt had his arm around Penny as they watch out exchange.

“Anyway.” I said as Alec dropped his hands. “We need to get going. Did you get her question answered?”

“Yeah.” Alec said as he walked over to the box of books.

“I’ll see you tonight, Ice.” Colt gave me a hug before opening the door. Alec picked up the books but made me walk in front of him. Colt held Penny’s hand as they followed Alec.

We made it to the foyer when we heard a crash. “HER? You chose her over me?” Kara looked like she had been crying for hours.

“She is my mate so yes.” Colt said firmly. Kara ran away crying as Penny looked sad. “Why are you upset?”

“Because her heart is broken. You guys have dated for forever. This must be hard for her.” Penny looked at the hallway she ran down. “Maybe I should talk to her.”

“F uck no!” I said maybe a little harsh. “Maybe wait till after you mate.” I said a little nicer.

“Okay…” Penny said looking unsure.

“Let’s get going.” Alec said in the mind link. “I don’t want to run into the b itch.” Nodding. I turned and

walked to the car. Alec put my books in the trunk and I put my stuff in after.

“See you tonight!” I yelled as we got in and Alec stepped on it.

Alec reached over and placed his hand on my thigh. “How is your arm feeling?”

“Sore but close to normal.” He didn’t look at me.noveldrama

“You okay?” I asked. Looping my arm around his, I held onto him.

“Yeah, just thinking about where she is from.”

“No idea. I assumed she wasn’t a ranking wolf. Who abandons their daughter?”

“Let’s worry about it tomorrow. Today is about you.” Alec leaned over and k*ssed me.

am ready for that massage.

“I’ll give you a better one tonight.” Alec smirked at me. We still had ten miles before we got back and an idea came to me. Giving him a look, I leaned over and pulled his d ick out.

“Ah f uck.” He growled as he squeezed my as s. I wasn’t sure what I was doing but the way his b*dy shi

I could feel the desire run through him. At one point, his hand cupped my head and helped me keep pac until I swallowed it all. Licking my l*ps, I sat up and leaned against the door as I watched him put his d ick away. We were pulling up to the pack house.

“Alpha… Luna” The guard nodded as I blushed.







###Chapter 89

“You’re going to be the death of me.” Alec said with a smile.

“As long as you die happy.” I shrugged. As we pulled up, dad and Marc were still standing around talking.

“Hey kids. It go okay?” Dad asked.

“You should ask Colt that question.” I smiled as I grabbed my stuff and Alec grabbed the box.

“Is that it?” Alpha Marc asked.

“Yup, I didn’t have a lot.” I said as we headed up to our room, put all my stuff on the coffee table.

“I need to go clean that stuff up. Are you going to be okay?” Alec asked.

“Yup, Emmy and I will be in her room the rest of the day.” I said as I looked at my stuff.noveldrama

“Well, this is your room now so think about what changes you want to make here. I want you to be comfortable.” Alec looked around.

Grabbing the two pictures, and jewelry box, I walked over and placed them on my side of the bed, on end table. Placing the jewelry box in front of them, I smiled. “I unpacked!” I gave Alec a sad smile. He looking through my sketches.

“Those are private.” I said.

“These are amazing.” Alec said as he kept fl*pping. He landed on one of Ace. “Can I borrow this?”

“Why?”

“Just trust me please?” I wanted to say no.

“Okay.”

Alec k*ssed my forehead. “I won’t damage it. Let’s go down to Emmy’s room.”

“Okay.”

After knocked once, Emmy ripped the door open. “About time!” She grabbed my hand and pulled me in.

“Jasper started without you. He left a cart for you.”

“Bye!” I yelled as Emmy slammed the door on an amused Alec.

“Did I pis s him off?” Emmy asked as she pulled me to the massage beds.

“No, he was amused.”

“Good. Get undressed and lay down.” The massage therapist turned around as I got undressed and laid my stuff in the chair. Laying down, I covered myself up.

As she got to work on my muscles, I let my mind drift. What would I want my bedroom to look like? Obviously it still needs to have an element of Alec. It’s mainly reds and black. However, I just brought a red dress and a black dress. Maybe nothing needed changed. Maybe he already had it decorated how my soul wanted.

“Thank you!” Emmy said to the ladies as they left the room. If my hair wasn’t a nest before, it was now. That scalp massage was everything

“Should I be worried how good you feel right now?” Alec joked in my head.

“I’ll hold out judgement until you show me what you can do tonight and I’ll let you know.” I teased.

“Challenge accepted.” Alec muttered.

“Earth to front of my face.

Krick Emmy snapped her finger

“Sorry!” I smiled at her.

“You can shower first!”

“Yes, ma’am!” Jumping up, my n*ked as s ran into the bathroom to get ready.

I couldn’t help myself. The mind link was open still with Alec. “Oh, Alec.” I moaned as I touched myself.

“The f uck you are! Stop that!” He was fighting the urges.

“What? I’m in the shower. My b*dy is dripping wet. The soap is sliding down m-*

“Unless you want me to come up there and f uck you in front of Emmy, I would stop.” He warned.

“Not a terrible idea.”

“Woman….” Alec sounded tired.

“I’m sorry, did I wear you out already?”

“And I thought I had a high S** drive.” Alec sighed.

“Can you keep up?” I finished my shower and got out. Drying myself off, I was loving this.







###Chapter 90

Chapter 0090 “Okay?” Taking the tissues out, and pulling out the most beautiful white silk button up oversized shirt and matching shorts. It said Luna on the back. “I got matching ones but it doesn’t say Luna!” Emmy held up hers. “I love it!” “Good, I’m going to shower and you need to wait for the rest till I bet back!” She took off. Grabbing some lotion, I was able to put some on, get dressed and was working on blow-drying my hair before she came out. “Oh good! You got it started.” “You refused to let me open my presents.” “Well, you can wait actually till everyone is here.” Okay,” Emmys love language was gift giving and I didn’t like spoiling her fun. “Sit down.” I had finished blow-drying my hair and sat down. She started putting in curlers in my hair. A knock at the door sounded and Emmy ran to let them in. It was someone from the kitchen bring a trav of fruits and veggies. “Alpha Alec wanted me to bring you girls some snacks.” “Thank you.” I said to her. noveldrama

“Welcome, Luna Kristen. Let me know if you need anything else.” “Will do, what was your name?” “Katie.” “Thank you, Katie.” I smiled at her as she left. “Alec for the win.” Emmy grabbed a strawberry and ate it. 1 She finished my hair and then moved on to hers. “Emmy, are you happy here?” “That’s a deep question. What’s wrong?” “Nothing wrong. All this is so sudden and …” “Kristen. I’ve known you since we were babies. Your commitment issues are showing. I thought you

were happy with Alec. He treats you like a princess.” “I love Alec. I’m liking it here. It’s just new.” “Have you told him you loved him?” “Yes.” I said defensively. “Like really told him? Not an I love you too kind of thing.” I just frowned. “Home is where Alec is. What do you need to make this feel like home?” “Colt.” I sighed. I’ve always had Colt. “Colt will always be a phone call away. Your twin isn’t going anywhere. It will be a change but it will be a good one.” Emmy finished her curlers. “Come sit so I can do your makeup.” eve w “Okay.” I wasn’t permitted to talk so we sat in silence as she gave me the works. The smoky on point with the winged eyeliner. My red l*ps will match my dress perfectly. The black earrings pulled it together. Emmy took my hair and while leaving a few stands down, did a low bun looking thing. It bad different loops and I felt beautiful. “Go sit over there and don’t mess up my artwork.” Emmy joked before doing her own. Grabbing some carrots, I sat and watched her work. She left most of her hair down but pulled the front back. Right as was finishing her make, the door opened. The guys walked in. “You look beautiful.” Alec said as he came up to me. “Don’t you mess up her makeup!” Emmy yelled as Alec was about to k*ss me. “I am her doll.” I laughed as Alec k*ssed me anyway. “You girls are cutting it close.” Jasper looked at her watch. “Ice, you can open your presents now.” “Do we get to call you Ice too now?” Jasper joked as he sat down in an arm chair. “As soon as you guess my IQ” I laughed as I sat down to open my presents. “120” He asked.

“Nope.” My first gift was from my dad. It was a gorgeous tennis bracelet. Alec helped me put it on. “Lower or higher?” Jasper thought. “What a rude question!” I faked being hurt. “125?” Jasper guessed again. Second present was from Colt. It was an expensive set of art supplies. “You insult me.” I kept teasing. she







###Chapter 91

Chapter 0091 He shrugged. “I picked italy.” “Thank you!” I said as I lunged at him. “Don’t mess up my masterpiece!” Emmy yelled. Alec smirked as he caught me, giving me a hug back. “Open ours next.” Jasper was still frowning. “1…”I saw Emmy hold up the number 4. “Hey! That’s cheating!” I yelled. “1407” “No.” I said taking the envelope. It had a gift card on it that said shopping spree for Italy. “Thank you guys! However, Emmy is this a gift for me or for you?” I laughed, “Both. You cannot wear anything you own to Italy. However, I will have fun dressing you. Now, get dressed.” “144?” Jasper called as I went into the closet. Sticking my head out, I touched the tip of my nose with my finger. “Holy s hit.”

I laughed as I sl*pped on my outfit. “Guess what?” I mind-linked Alec. “Hmm?” Coming out of the closet, I watched Alecs eyes look me over. “I’m not wearing anything under it.” His eyes darkened as he made eye contact. v run Jasper had got up and was hugging Emmy but Alec just sat there. It was hard to get a reading on him as he wasn’t showing me his emotions.”Do you not like it?” I asked still in the mind-link. Uncertainly through me. Finally he got up and hugged me. “I’m trying to not rip it from your b*dy and f uck you right here and now. Every f ucking guy is going to get his eyes ripped out tonight for looking at you. This night better

go quick head. so I can shove my di ck so far up you that you can’t walk tomorrow.” He growled in my “So you like it?” “It fits you like a glove. So f ucking s exy His hands started at my hips and run up before going back down. “Thank you.” “Dam n girl, you look great. An n is going to lose her f ucking mind.” Emmy whistled as Jasper let her go. “That’s the hope.” I laughed as Alec let me go. “We need to get going.” Jasper said. “Yeah, the car is out front.” Alec took my hand and we walked out of the room. Alec was wearing a solid black tux with a scarlet red tie. It matched me so perfectly. I felt like the prettiest girl on the se xiest guys arm. “Oh, more more thing..” Alec stopped walking when we hit the foyer. He looked over at a group of kids watching everyone leaving for the dance. My mark was on full display as I smiled at them. I “Hey Calvin!” I said a little c cky. They all looked over and the ones that understood started laughing. “S hit.” He hung his head as he drug his feet over to me. “I believe I won the bet.” “Yes, Luna.” “That would be 100 pushups.” I said to him. “I’ll make sure he does them!” Ted volunteered. “Perfect. Tomorrow afternoon, I want to see you in our office with all your art work. I hear you have a knack for it and I want to see it.” noveldrama

Calvin’s mouth dropped. “But why? I’m no good.” “Because I said so. Have fun!” I said to them before Alec led me away. Opening the front passenger door, I got in. Jasper and Emmy were already in the back. “Why do you want to see his art work?” Jasper asked. “He just needs some guidance and I think he will be someone I might hire to work for me at the shop.” “He is a screw up.” Jasper said. “He needs to find out what he cares about. If I’m right, I think this will be a turning point for him.” “Oh?”






###Chapter 92

Chapter 0092 “Obviously…” Jasper put him arm around Emmy. He looked like a classic f uck me boy but thankfully he was good for Emmy. Turning around, Alec placed his hand on my thigh. Wrapping my arm around his. “Remember last time we were on this road?” I said in the mind-link. Alec didn’t respond but squeezed my thigh and shifted uncomfortably. Emmy and Jasper were in their own world. Laying my head on his arm, I just smiled. I “What are you thinking about?” Alec asked me in the mind-link. was happy. “How happy I am.” I answered in the mind-link but I looked up at him. He glanced down and k*ssed my forehead. “Good.”

We pulled to see Colt and Penny standing out front. “What?” Emmy yelled. 1 Jumping out of the car, I ran to them. “So happy for you!” Throwing my arms around him. Emmy came up and hugged Penny. Both of them were sporting fresh marks. “Kris?” Dad’s voice boomed from inside I was about to run in when Colt grabbed my arm. Looking b he shook his head no before giving my arm to Alec. “Keep her close.” Colt mouthed. Alec wrapped his arm around me firmly just as dad made his way out. “Kristen! You look beautiful!” Dad came over to me and gave me a hug. He was shaking Alec’s hand as An n walked out. “What are you wearing? I had a strict dress code!” An n was shaking from anger. Both Colt and Alec stepped close to me. Jasper grabbed Penny and moved both girls away. “An n, let it go. She looks beautiful. It’s her birthday after all.” Dad said. An n ignored him and walked

up to me. I kept my head high but Alec thought she was close enough and took a step forward, halting her progress. “Get out of my way, boy!” An n shrieked. “No. That is close enough.” Alec said dangerously calm. “Let’s all head down.” Dad spoke as Jacob walked out. After surveying the scene, he calmly walked around and behind me. Dad grabbed An n ‘s arm and pulled her away. Colt took Penny and they fell in line with Jacob. Alec and me were next, then Emmy and Jasper. We all got in our own golf cars and they took us to the event center. Cars were lined up as people made their way inside. Outside, there was a massive banner that read, ‘Happy Birthday Colt and Kristen!’. “Oh wow.” I said as we got off. Alec wrapped his arm around me as we made our way inside. Taking a right, we had to wait to be announced. Jacob went in and took his seat with Emmy and Jasper. Now, it was just Colt, Penny, dad and An n with us in this tiny room. “Why is it so hard for you to be a good daughter just once!” An n rounded on me. Alec was instantly pi sse d off as he firmly kept me beside him. “An n, I am not doing this! It is her birthday, either don’t speak to her or just f ucking leave.” Dad was turning red in the face. “You always take her side!” An n acted like she was going to cry. “Because you are always being a bit ch! Honestly, I would have never mated you if I knew this is how it would turn out but now Colt has his mate, I don’t f ucking care.” “After everything I did to make this night happen, this is the thanks I get?” She switched to angry quick. “Are you guys ready? They are about to start.” A staff member with a head set popped his head in. “Yes, we are.” Dad said firmly. “Perfect, line up, please.” Dad stood beside An n at the front. Colt first and then me. “Prese Alpha Brian and Luna An n!” The announcer called. Everyone cheered as dad and An n made either way down the carpet and to their seats. noveldrama

“Future Alpha Colt and his mate Penny!” The cheers were even louder as they walked out. “I hate this part.” I whispered to Alec. “I don’t like being the center of attention.”






###Chapter 93

Chapter 0093 “I know, baby girl.” Alec rubbed my back. “How many pet names are you going to try out?” I asked.. “They all just quite don’t fit.” Alec muttered. “Finally, Kristen and her mate, future Alpha Alec of the Blue Fang pack!” Alec and I walked out to the largest cheering yet. Lights blinded me as I waved going down the isle. There was whispers about my dress I couldn’t not hear. “That dress!” “So pretty!” “Oh my Go d! I love her dress!” “If an F U dress.” That last one was my favorite. that’s fo noveldrama

My heart was pounding as we made out way down the carpet. Dad and An n stood as Colt and Penny took the left and Alec and I moved to the right. I was finally able to see throughout the room. The rest of the ranking wolves were sitting in the front row. On the far end, to the right, was Darin and his ranking wolves as well. His eyes drilled holes into mine as I made eye contact. Shivers ran up my spine. Breaking eye contact, I started listening to the announcements. evening! Will be served. Please enjoy your Right on cue, everyone sat as the waitresses and waiters came out with the meal. Alec helped me sit before he sat. Thankfully, dad was sitting next to me. “Something to drink, Luna Kris?” I recognize him as a pack member of my dad’s. “Dr. Pepper and whiskey please.” “And you, Alpha Alec?”

“Whiskey on the rocks.” “Thank you, Roger.” I said as he moved on to my dad. A plate of smoked turkey, roasted asparagus with a loaded mashed potato. Everything smelled so good. “This looks good.” Alec muttered to me. “It really does.” I agreed as I took a bite of turkey. The juices were flavorful as they ran down my throat. “Please try to not make me feral with your moaning.” Alec whispered in my ear, so low that no one heard. “I’ll save it for later.” I replied back as I took another bite. “Go-” Alec started but our drinks arrived. “Thank you.” Taking a sip, it tasted and went down too easily. A photographer came around and took pictures of us as a couple before moving on. Multiple times, people would come up to us to either wish me a happy birthday or to congratulate us on our mating. After half the food on my plate was gone, I just started pushing it around. The cake part was coming up and then the first dance. All I wanted was the after party dance. Where the dj really let loose and rocked it out. Alec leaned back and put his arm around my chair and lifted his ankle over his knee. When I leaned back, he pulled my chair closer to his “What will it take to relax you?” Alec said in our mind-link. Grabbing my whiskey, I took a large sip. “To not be sitting here.” I said back. “Young lady! Sit up at the table and have some manners!” An n leaned over dad and whispered angrily. “All right, ladies and gentlemen. Let’s cut the cake!” Giving An n a smirk, that just p iss ed her off more, Colt walked up to me. Taking his hand he offered, I allowed Alec to take my drink. We walked over to the cake table that was just off to the side. Colt picked up the knife and offered it to me. Shaking my head no, he went ahead and cut the cake.

Cutting a small piece. However, when he pulled the cake back, it was lemon flavor. I absolutely hated lemon cake. Taking a deep breath, I wasn’t going to make a scene. Colt frowned as he looked at dad. Following his gaze, I saw An n smiling brightly. “I almost forgot!” Dad boomed. He held up a finger as he jogged off the stage. Colt was just as confused as I was until dad pulled out a smaller full chocolate cake with big numbers sitting on top. “My last chance to spoil my litter girl!” Dad joked as the entire tent started laughing. An n put on a half happy face but her eyes were full of anger.







###Chapter 94

Chapter 0094 “Enjoy.” Dad k*ssed my forehead as he gave me a hug. Colt cut me a piece before handing it to me. Wel each took our bites as the room erupted in applause. Everyone went back to talking but as Colt was leading me to the floor, someone stopped us. “Happy birthday!” Darin’s voice caused me to recoil. Colt instantly pulled me close to me but I was still standing tall Beside him. “Alec!” I mind-linked him. He didn’t respond but I felt his anger. “Thank you. We appreciate you coming out this evening.” Colt said in a forced niceness. “It was my pleasure. I was hoping to be able to have a dance with you, Ms. Kristen.” I felt Alecs arm sl*p around me. “Thank you for your interest. I am going to have my first dance with my mate, Alpha Alec but I’m sure later on we will be able to meet up.” I said as I took Alecs hand. “Hmm, yes.” Darin was pi ssed. His eyes landed on my mark but the music started playing so we walked

off. Alec held me close as i wrapped my arms around him. “I’m going to kill him” Alec muttered quietly. His eyes were looking around the room. Pulling his head towards me, his forehead rested against mine. “Later. Right now, let’s just da “Anything for you.” Alec purred as my thumb rubbed his neck. “You’re looking pretty f ucking good tonight.” I said to him. My hand wrapped around his tie as I he tight to me. “You look pretty tasty yourself.” “This dress needs to survive the night. I want to wear this again.” “Can’t promise anything.” Alecs hand just resting on top of my as s.

“Alec?” Butterflies attacked my stomach. “Yes?” Looking him in the eyes, “I love you.” I said as sincerely as I could. His eyes studied mine. The surprise he felt quickly turned into happiness. “You have no idea how much I love you.” Alec planted the sweetest k*ss to my l*ps. There was a firm poking on Alec’s shoulder. Breaking our k*ss, we looked over. A n was standing there with Darin beside her. “I told Darin he could have the first dance with you.” “That wasn’t your place to make such a promise.” I said bluntly. “I’ll dance with him later.” “How dare you!” An n grabbed my arm and tried to pull me away from Alec. Thankfully, Alec was faster and pulled me away. “I suggest you walk away or you will not like my next move.” Alec said opening threatening. “An n, you are making a scene.” Dad muttered angrily as he approached. “I am sick and tired of this b itch acting like she can do whatever she wants!” A nn openly stated. The music stopped and everyone was listening I’m not sure what came over me. I just snapped. Red clouded my vision as I loudly started speaking. “I am not part of my dad’s pack anymore and therefore not under your control. I am the f ucking Luna to the Blue Fang pack. You can either accept that and give me the respect I deserve or you can the f uck out of my party. I will NOT be dancing with Darin. Any promises you made to them were empty and had no grounds. You have no authority over me. You can back the f uck up before I put you in your place.” I was proud of myself, Alec was beaming with pride. His arm was around me as his claws dug into my hin Colt had an ‘oh s hit’ look to him as well as everyone I could see. It was quiet for a few seconds! Emmy started clapping.

###Chapter 95

Chapter 0095 “That was amazing!” Emmy ran up to me, barreling into me. “I’m not sure what got into me.” I was a little shocked myself. “It’s the Luna in you coming out. Your authority was being questioned and your wolf didn’t like it.” Jasper nodded in approval as he pulled Emmy to him. Alec had his arm around me instantly as we followed Jasper over to his table. Jacob had his arm around some girl, Kevin was doing the same and Colt had just arrived. “Penny! Congratulations!” Emmy gave Penny a hug. “I was so shocked!” Penny was smiling from ear to ear. Alec handed me my drink as the music changed. The young crowd started dancing like it was a club. “Now thi this is a party!” Jacob took a drink as he made eye contact with me. His eyes were haunted. “I got a surprise for you.” Alec whispered in my ear. He led me to the front of the tent. On a table of his own, a massive picture of Ace sat there with a beautiful flower arrangement. “Thank you.” My arm went around his waist as I looked at it. “I can’t believe he is gone.” Jacob said as he walked up behind us. “I know. I expect him to walk in the door any minute.” I said in response.

“This was a nice thing you did, man.” Jacob held out his hand to Alec. “I can’t imagine the pain you are going through. Anything I can do fo “Appreciate it. Just take care of our girl. She’s like my “She is something special.” Alec agreed. sister.” n do for you guys. We walked back to the group. Alec sat in the chair and I sat on his lap. “That dress is everything.” Penny

applauded me. “Thanks! I found it fitting to wear.” Taking a sip, I did a little shake. “Let’s dance!” Emmy said as a Low by Flo Rida came on. Taking her hand, I jumped up and took off dancing. Alec POV “I want Darin removed from this evening.” I said to the table. Colt, Jasper, Jacob and Kevin all leaned in. Jacob told his date go to dance so we could speak. “What did you have in mind?” Jasper asked. “I don’t f ucking care. Kristen doesn’t lay eyes on him again.” “I got this.” Jacob stood up and walked into the crowd. Colt watched him leave but didn’t make a move to stop him. I “Your boy good?” I was trying to hide how f ucking pis sed off I was. “He’s got this.” Colt said confidently. “There has already been enough drama” C hugging the rest of my drink, I needed another. “Colt, you got her?” I asked. “Yeah, grab me one.” Colt chu gged his as well. I knew my face wasn’t friendly. I didn’t realize it was as bad as it was until everyone moved out of my way. I “A-alpha Alec? What c-can I get you sir?” The bartender asked. “Two whiskeys on the rocks and a whiskey and Dr. Pepper.” He nodded and started making them. “Lovely evening, isn’t it?” My fist balled up. “The f uck do you want, Darin?” “Just one dance.” He slid his glass over to another bartender.

“Over my dead b*dy.” I “I’m sorry, Alpha Darin, we are out of Jameson. Can I offer you this bottle of Jim Beam instead?” “F ucking bar. I guess.” The bottle was already open but I saw a fresh bottle of Jameson that wasn’t opened. The bartender poured him a drink and then passed it to him. “Good evening, sir.” Sliding my glasses to me, he nodded before walking away. “I’d be careful. People might think we are enemies.” Darin took a large sip of his Jameson. “We sure as hell aren’t friends.” I had to bit my tongue. “I have a feeling we are going to be spending more time together” Darin muttered right as his stomach started rolling. “Sounds like you need a bathroom “I found that incredibly amusing Jumping him would be too obnout. Poisoning him would be cause for a war Giving him the s hits would force him to stay in the bathroom “The f uck did you do to me?” His eyes glared as he started to sweatnoveldrama







###Chapter 96

Chapter 0096 “Me? What did I do?” I laughed. Taking advantage, my fist connected with his stomach. At the same time. his as s lost the battle as s hit ran down his leg. Seeing him half run, half jog out of the room was hilarious. Pulling ing out my wallet, I tossed a $50 to the bartender. “Thank you.” I said as I walked back to the table right as the girls got there. Sliding Colt’s over to him, Jacob returned. “Get the drinks okay?” Colt asked. “Yeah. S hittingly well.” Jacob smirked as Colt frowned but rolled his eyes at Jacob. “What did you guys do?” Kristen asked as she took a sip. Her eyes looked at us accusingly. “Not a d amn thing. I got us more drinks.” I said, I’m my defense. “Just enjoy your evening.” Colt took a sip. “It’s your birthday too.” Kristen said. She looked around before whispering something in Colt’s ear. His b*dy tensed slightly but otherwise, remained neutral. I doubt anyone noticed it was so minimal. “Hey Ice, you ready for tomorrow?” Emmy looked at Kristen over her drink. Excitement ran through Kristen. “F uck yeah! This will be so much fun.” noveldrama

Taking my own sip, I had forgotten about her challenge. I was not happy she issued one when I heard it and I’m still not happy. It wasn’t that I doubted her, I didn’t want her to have to fight. This whole thing was pointless now she was Luna. What did she need to prove by fighting. “We will have to grill tomorrow after!” Emmy was making a whole thing of this. “Alpha, there is a situation out back.” A warrior mind-linked me. “Excuse us ladies.” I said and nodded for Colt to follow me. Jasper and Jacob turned themselves so their were watching the girls. However, they were so engrossed in making plans, I doubt they noticed our departure.

Colt didn’t a etwo ask but followed my lead as we walked out the front and down the sidewalk. There were men on the ground and four standing over them. “What’s going on?” I asked. That’s when I heard the whimpering. Looking over, there was a girl huddled against the wall. Her dress was torn and she was bleeding from her “It’s what it looks like, Alpha. We heard the scream and now knuckles. nose here just in time.” My warrior had blood on his “Pick them up.” I said as I took my jacket off and rolled my sleeves. Colt was already doing the same. “Move into the trees.” I said. Two men grabbed each guy that was on the ground. “She asked for it!” I didn’t even respond but landed a punch to his jaw. I knew I broke it, instantly. We got into the woods and my warriors held them still. “Mom, there is a girl outside that needs your help.” I mind-linked her. I closed the link instantly. She didn’t need to hear this. “What pack are you from?” I asked but I knew the answer. ” you.” Colt landed a solid punch to his stomach. “You think it’s appropriate to touch what isn’t yours? I didn’t let them answer as I landed my own punch to his stomach. Without waiting, I brought my knee up, breaking his nose. My guy was on the ground moaning. After stomping on his d ick, I picked him up by his shirt. “Don’t touch another f ucking girl like that or I will kill you.” Then I delivered the final punch knocking him out. Thankfully I had an all black shirt off. a Looking at my warriors, “take care of them.” I commanded.

Colt and I walked out of the woods. Mom was kneeling down, talking to the girl. They book looked at m as we approach. 1 “How are you?” Colt asked. “Could have been worse.” Mom frowned. “What pack are you from?” “Midnight River.” “Is that common practices?” I asked. “Y-yes.” She didn’t want to answer me but did. “Please just let me go. It will be worse for me if anything comes of this.” “How old are you?” “19.” “Do you have a mate?” Colt asked. “N-no” she shook her head. I held out my hand and helped her stand up. A little blood got on me from her







###Chapter 97

Chapter 0097 “Let my mom take you to the bathroom and help you clean up so you can rejoin the party.” I commanded. There was an option there but not much. “Come on, dear” Mom put her arm around her and we followed them. As they went into the woman’s bathroom, we went into the men’s. Jacob was washing his hands. Walking up to the sink, his back straightened. “What is that smell?” Colt and I looked at him weird. “Blood.” I shrugged. Turning the water on, I was about to put my hands in the water but my back slammed against the wall. My claws and danger were out as I circled his neck. “What the hell, Jacob?” Colt asked. Jacob ignored my hand as he smelled my hand. It was then I clicked. “F uck.” Retracting my claws, I drug him out of the bathroom. Not even knocking, I stuck my head into the women’s. Mom looked at me appalled.

“What the hell, Alec?” “Bring the girl out here.” I said with authority. I saw them look at each other weirdly before they head my way. Colt was standing by with his arms folded. We had made enough noise that the music stoppe and a crowd gathered. Kristen walked up, looking shocked that my hand was still firmly around his throat. “Alec?” I held up a finger, telling her to wait. Mom and the girl came out and as soon as they saw each other they both yelled mate. Jacob tried to run to her but she was frozen, Grabbing her arm, I drug both of them outside. “Alec! Wait!” My mom yelled. Probably scared for what I was going to do. Unfortunately, the crowd

came with us. “Everyone! Back inside!” I growled angrily. Everyone went inside but mom, Kristen, Emmy, Jaspers, Colt, Penny and our parents. “Let me go!” Jacob demanded. “Shut the f uck up” I growled at him. My authority was enough he stopped fighting me. The girl was just standing there. Letting her go, she put a few feet between Jacob and herself. “Jacob listen. She was just attacked by some guys. She is scared and needs some space.” I said trying to “We already took care of them.” Colt stepped forward. Jacob stopped fighting me. Colt nodded at me and I let him go. “Jacob is the ga mma at Blue Fang pack. Colt’s pack. You will be safe there. He will treat you right.” I spoke softer to the girl. “It’s okay.” She took a few hesitant steps towards Jacob. He help out his hands and waited for her to touch him. Her hands shook as she reached out and touched his fingers before quickly pulling them back. “What was that?” She asked scared looking around. “The mate bond.” Kristen said coming forward. She put her arms around my waist. She tried again as she reached out again and put her whole hand in his. Slowly she inched closer until she wrapped her arms around him. Jacob gently eloped her into a hug, holding her tightly. “What do we have here?” Darin asked as he stepped out from the door frame. “Sherry?” “Y-yes, Alpha?” She backed away and kneeled before him. I had to keep my claws away. “It appears she is mated to my gam ma, Jacob.” Colt said through gritted teeth. Kristen let go of me and moved the other girls back.

“Is this true?” He asked Sherry. “Yes, Alpha.” She kept her head down. “Hmm, this is interesting, indeed.” Darin muttered. “It goes without saying she will be accompanying us home.” Colt said. “What about your belongings?” “We have a tradition where newly mated members get a whole new closet.” Kristen spoke up. Looking back, she was standing in front of all the women, even my mot her. “I’ll tell you what. I’ll allow her to go home with Jacob here, if you dance with me to the song of my choice.” Darin was looking at Kristen. Her back straightened but looked right at Sherry. Sherry was shaking in fright.noveldrama







###Chapter 98

Chapter 0098 “As long as you behave, I’ll dance once with you.” My eyes narrowed at her. “Good. Let’s go.” Darin held out his arm to her. Kristen avoided eye contact with me as she took his arm. I felt a hand wrap around my arm. “You’re going to want to let go.” I said firmly. “Stay out here. I have her.” It was Colt. Probably the only man that has the balls to touch or question me. “I’m fine.” Ripping my arm free, I walked in just as the music changed into tango. The most f u cking S**ual type of dance there was. I was f ucking fuming. His hand was just barely over her as s. “Alec..” Jasper and Emmy walked up beside me. “You’re going to want to leave me the f uck alone.” I said as I took his drink from his hand and shot it back. Jasper led Emmy away but Colt stayed beside me. “I don’t need a f ucking babysitter.” “If you go, I go.” His voice was just as restrained as I felt. He didn’t feel her emotions though. She felt disgusted and repulsed.

“We are leaving after this.” “Us too.” The song came to an end and Darin dipped Kristen. Setting my drink down, I walked up to them. He was k*ssing her hand. “I was just thanking her for the dance.” Pulling her against me, my hand firmly around her waist. “Sherry is going home with Jacob.” I said firmly. “A deal is a deal” Darin smiled at Kristen. Turning, I pulled Kristen with me. Walking past our table, “we are leaving, now!” I commanded and kept walking. Kristen didn’t even protest as she kept up pace with me. The cars were around front as soon

as we walked out. I assumed Jasper called them but I didn’t f ucking care in this minute. Walking up to the driver’s door, my hand ripped it opened. “Get out.” I wanted to f ucking drive. Looking around, I appeared everyone was getting into a vehicle. Jasper and Emmy sat quietly in the back. Slamming the door, my foot slammed on the gas. “F UCK!” I half yelled, half growled as my hand slapped the steering wheel. Kristen reached over and put her hand on my thigh. Both my hands gripped the steering wheel as we raced down the highway. I emotions were calming down the further away we got. Which, helped me but I was still f ucking pi ssed. I I “Open the f ucking gate.” I mind linked the guards. The gate was open just enough as I plowed through it. Rock got sent flying as I came to a skidding stop. Not wasting any time, there was one thing on my mind. Kristen didn’t wait for me as she ran ahead. I took two steps at a time until we were at the bedroom door. Opening it with my code, I barely got it closes before I slammed Kristen against the wall. My mouth was on hers but it was her hands taking my clothes off. Lifting up her dress, she has my pants dropped. Stepping out of them, I inserted a finger into her. “Ah!” Kristen’s eyes rolled back as she clung to me. I couldn’t wait. She was wet and I had needs. Ramming my di ck into her, she wrapped her legs around me. Clinging into me,she matched my energy. “I’ll make it up to you.” I groaned. “F uck me, Alec!” T “Say my name!” I demanded. “Alec!” “Again!” “Alec!” She moaned. “AGAIN!” I pushed my aura out even though it did nothing.

“ALEC!” “That’s right, you are f ucking mine!” I growled before I bit my mark as I shot my load into her. “ALEC!” She screamed before I felt a sting in my own shoulder. The need wasn’t as strong but I wasn’t done. Kristen pov I was f ucking sore this morning. However, it was the best night of my life. Currently, I was wrapped up around me, keeping me feeling safe. After yesterday, I wanted nothing more than to stay here. “You’re awake.” Alec muttered, it wasn’t a question but a statement.noveldrama








###Chapter 99

Chapter 0099 “Nope.” Shoving my as s further into him, I felt him chuckle. “You need to get up and get a good breakfast in you. You have a fight to win.” “Looking forward to it!” “You need to focus. Winning this will keep others away.” He sounded more concerned then I felt. “Who else has had the balls to challenge me? Plus, I am the one that issued this challenge.” I sighed as I rolled out of bed. It was getting more and more comfortable to be n*ked in front of Alec. I was very much aware of him staring at my as s as I walked to the bathroom and shut the door. A shower wasn’t needed but since I probably smelled like S**, I wanted to go in smelling neutral. The bathroom door opened right as I put my head under the hot water. “They might not have issued the challenge yet but it is still a possibility.” Alec muttered as he joined me in

the shower. It was all I could do to not roll my eyes at him. “Are you worried someone might beat me?” I was massaging shampoo in my hair as Alec was washing his b*dy. Nothing about this was S**ual. Just two people in the shower having a conversation. It struck me a weird, since I had always assumed when people shower together, it was a S**ual thing. This was level of comfort I didn’t realize was possible. I “No. I mean… I haven’t seen you fight but I rather not see it either.” Alec was clearly not happy about today. Actually, he seemed rather grumpy. “Is Colt coming today?” “Suppose to.” We rotated position as the shampoo was rinsed out of my hair. noveldrama

“I still can’t believe him and Penny are mates.” She was an amazing person. “I wonder how Kara is taking it.” “Is Kara a fighter?” My b*dy froze as my mind went to where his was. “Yes. Penny isn’t. She is a scholar like me.” “But you still fight.” Alec sighed. “Only because I forced my dad to teach me.” After one last rinse off, Alec turned the shower off and handed me a towel. We both walked out of the bathroom and into the closet. “I have some s hit to do today.” Alec had his back turned to me as he got dressed. “That’s fine. I am capable of finding my own way down there.” I was starting to get annoyed at his attitude. He’s known about this fight for over a week now. We weren’t even mated when I issued it. “Fine.” Alec walked out and slammed the bedroom door on his way out. “Someone needs a tampon today…” I whispered under my breath. Grabbing my cell phone. / dialed Penny’s number. “Hello?” girl! How How are you?” I im you?” I immediately kicked myself for not thinking they would be busy “I’m good. We were actually getting ready to head over to your pack. Colt has some stuff to do with Alec.” Penny sounded like she was slightly out of breath. “Okay! I was looking for an update on the shop. I feel weird not having anything to do” “Okay, I will bring all that with me.” Penny’s voice sounded far away like she had put the phone down. Her tone said she wasn’t actually paying attention to the conversation “Okay, well. Thank you. I’ll see you soon.” “Okay, bye!” Penny hung up the phone quickly. Looking down, my heart sank a little. I had put on a sports bra with a fitted workout tank. They were white with matching black and white shorts. Although

they weren’t spandex, it was still rather tight on my thighs. Showing off my killer b*dy. Putting some tennis shoes on, I decided to get some breakfast before. Walking gout of our bedroom, the packhouse was alive. Voices echoed up the stairs with laughter and the sounds of feet running across the marble. It was Saturday morning and summer was almost here. It was 7:30am so I assumed morning training was already complete. My wolf was energetic and loving the energy this pack had. We weren’t a technical member yet but since we were marked by the future alpha, this was our pack.







###Chapter 100

Chapter 0100 The kitchen doors were wide open, probably from all the voices blowing it open. Multiple tables were lined in rows as everyone was catching about their days activities. My eyes landed on Emmy sitting at the front table with Jasper. Smiling, I made my way to them. “Hey guys!” I said cheerfully as I pulled out a seat in front of them. “Hey girl! I’m surprised to see you here!” Emmy turned to face me and away from Jacob. He leaned back and lifted an eyebrow. 1 “Why’s that?” “After last night, I assumed Alec would have you tied up in your room.” Her eyes did a little dance of excitement. “S hit. He is pis sy this morning. I don’t actually know where he is.” I rolled my eyes and leaned back as well. noveldrama

“What did you do?” Emmy laughed. 1 didn’t do s hit! He is mad about this challenge I have today.” I leaned in so other couldn’t hear me. “I think it’s that time of month for him.” Emmy busted up laughing as Jasper tried to hide a smile. “Colt should be here soon with Penny. I think Jacob is coming with Sherry too.” That caught my attention. “Seriously? I leaned forward and put my hands on the table at this information. “Yes. There is going to be a big meeting after your challenge. Did-did Alec not tell you about it?” My eyes narrowed at this. That mother f ucker. “No. He did not.” Standing up. “Excuse me. It appears I need to have some words with my mate.” I said through gritted teeth. “This will be good.” Jasper whispered as I turned around and started walking off. My good mood was gone. I could hear Emmy and Jasper following me. My angry foot steps echoed all the way up the stairs and to Alec’s office door. Not even knocking, I threw the door open. Alec was sitting in his chair

and Angela was standing in front of him. It looked like she just bathed and put on her own clothes for this fight. My wolf was instantly pis sed off. I knew my eyes changed as Alec’s closed and took a deep breath. “Isn’t this cozy.” I said as I walked in. Jasper and Emmy sl*pped in and closed the door behind them. They sl*pped off to the couch and sat down like they would enjoy the show. “This meeting doesn’t concern you.” Angela narrowed her eyes at me. “Is that so?” I walked around Angela, intentionally bumping my shoulder into hers, I went straight up to Alec. Shoving his chair back, I sat down on his lap with an attitude. I knew by his grunt that I got him a little but I didn’t give a f uck. Crossing my legs and arms, I glared at her. “Last time I checked, this was my office too as I am the future luna here. Whatever you need to speak to MY mate about, you can say in front of me.” Alec didn’t even try to move me. Instead. He felt rather amused by this whole thing. “Angela requested a meeting before the challenge.” He spoke out loud. “Great. What do you want to talk about? You can’t be asking to stop the challenge as I am the only person that can do that. So please, explain why you need to speak with Alec?” “The challenge was in place before you guys mated, making this completely Alec’s concern.” Angela crossed her arms over her chest and popped out her leg. Her boobs popped out from her shirt and I swear her whole a ss was hanging out. “Wrong. If you want to go off that logic, I was still part of my dad’s pack. That would mean it would be his choice to stop this, not Alec’s. Hell, it would even be Alpha Marc’s choice to cancel this. Believe it or not, this is f ucking happening.” “I was just trying to save you the embarrassment of losing. Plus, I know what Alec likes in the bedroom. I would be a better mate for him.” Angela gave me a f uck you smile. Mrs. Smith

###Chapter 101

Chapter 0101 The room faded away as my temper flared. Standing up, my wolf was showing as she walked up to Angela and grabbed her by the nape of her neck. Shoving her face down, my wolf looked at Alec. “Start the f ucking challenge. NOW!” Without waiting an answer, she walked Angela out of the office and straight out of the packhouse. Everyone that witnessed us, started to follow us. There was a lot of ‘oh s hits’ and ‘f uck yeahs’ being whispered. My wolf pay no attention to them as she marched straight out to the ring that was being set up. My wolf didn’t wait as she walked straight into the ring and tossed her to the side. Angela fell on her hands and knees. Walking backwards, we kept our eyes on her. “Kris…” Alec’s voice was behind me. “F uck off, Alec.” I said in the mind-link. As mad as I was, I was not about to have this conversation in front of people. “How f ucking dare you hide a meeting with Angela from me! How f ucking dare you having an important meeting with Sherry and not discuss this with me! I am suppose to be your f ucking equal. Is this how this is going to be? You hiding s hit from me? I will not live like that!” I turned and let him see the. hurt in my eyes. He took a step towards me but I took one back. Alec’s eyes hardened. “Colt and your family just got here.” He turned and walked over to Alpha Marc who was standing with his arms crossed. He was glaring at his son as my family approached.

“What is wrong with Ice?” Colt asked. Alec shook his head and walked past him. Colt walked up to me. with his hands out. “Ice?” “I’m going to kill her.” I said threw gritted teeth. Colt walked up to me and placed his hands on my shoulders. “Breath.” Colt took a deep breath, wanting me to follow him. Out of pure stubbornness, I refused. “Ice…come on.” I looked over as Jasper put a hand on Alec, keeping him from coming over here. Turning my attention. noveldrama

back to Colt, I gave in and listened. Taking a deep breath, my wolf relaxed and moved back to allow me to come forward. “I’m fine.” I said after a minute. “What happened?” “Alec didn’t tell me about the meeting with Sherry! Like he is trying to keep me in the dark about. everything. Then I walk into his office to see him having a private meeting with this bit ch. She then tells me, she knows what he likes in the bedroom.” It all spilled out as the hurt filled my heart. “Ah.” Colt nodded as he took in all my rambling. I crossed my arms over my chest as I looked up at the sky. Rain clouds were starting to grow in the distance. “You know that he has to have meetings with 1/2 “Not with her!” I glared at him. “Then you need to discuss what you feel comfortable with. Tell him how you feel and come to an agreement. ice, I don’t know Alec very well but I do know that he loves you. He wouldn’t intentionally hurt you.” “Who’s brother are you? You are suppose to go kick his as s for hurting me.” I was letting my stubborn side. take over. “Kristen, listen. Every newly mated couple, especially those in ranking positions have a period where they have to figure out what works for them. Did you really expect to come here and think everything was going to be rainbows and sunshine?” Colt moved so he was standing in front of my face. My eyes glanced over at Alec. His arms were folded, and he was staring right at me. Jasper and Alpha Marc were slightly in front of him. “Yes… no… I don’t know. I was so focused on getting away from A nn that I didn’t really think about it.” “You are the smartest person I know, but when it comes to emotions, you are just like the rest of us.”








###Chapter 102

Chapter 0102 “How rude!” I playfully slapped his shoulder. Colt laughed and pulled me into a hug. “You need to focus. Angela has been trained as a fighter and you need to not be acting like a jealous girlfriend. You can easily beat her but you need to have your head on your shoulders.” “Yeah… yeah.” I said reluctantly. “Why are you so good at this? You just found your mate yesterday, too?” “I’ve had more conversations with dad about it than you. You were so focused on your shop that talking about mates wasn’t really a thing. Plus, we weren’t sure who your mate was.” Colt trailed off after the last bit. “FIGHTERS READY?” Alpha Marc’s voice boomed out. My attention was brought back to the topic at hand. The stands were filled, someone was talking to Angela, showing her a move and my eyes landed on my dad. He was standing proudly beside Penny. “You got this, Ice.” Colt gave me one last hug before walking back to the side. noveldrama

Turning my attention to the bit ch, I started stretching my arms and legs out. My adrenaline was pumping as excitement grew up again. My wolf was pacing in the back of my mind with her teeth out. She wanted blood. Angela gave me a s tupid smirk as she glanced over at Alec and smiled. Following her eyes, Alec was only looking at me. I felt a few times of him trying to mind-link me but I kept that door shut. I needed to focus and nothing he could say right now would be helpful. I needed to do this for me. No one was going to jump me in the bathroom in my own club and get away from it. “FIGHT!” Dad’s voice rang out and Angela ran after me. Crouching down, I got ready. If I remembered correctly, Angela had a right hand. My memory served correctly as she faked left and came at me with her right. Lifting my forearm, I blocked it before bringing my left around. She blocked that too but she didn’t see my knee coming. It landed right in her stomach.

“ooooff” she breathed but recovered quickly. She used her momentum to fall and knock my knees out from under me. “S hit.” I whispered as I fell back but I was able to rotate and land on my hands and knees. Angela was right on top of me, delivering a punch to my kidney. This was a move we practiced. It was like second nature at this point. Reaching around, my arm wrapped around her neck and pulled her up and over me. We ended up with landed a decent blow to the back of my head, I moved so I was on top of her. Pulling my hand back, I punched her straight in the nose. It broke instantly as blood sprayed everywhere. Not wanting this fight to be over yet, I stood up and backed off her. “Get up, b itch.” I said loudly. I wanted everyone to know I wasn’t done. Angela rolled to the side, put her nose back in place and wobbled but stood up. “Is that all you have?” She ran after me again but her movement were weak and pitiful. It was too easy to block her right hand and deliver an upper cut that sent her flying backwards. My wolf was still seeing red. Walking up to her, I grabbed her shirt and pulled her up before delivering a solid kick to her chest. Angela flew backwards until she hit the rope that forced her on her knees. She finally collapsed. Trying to get up, she fell forward again. Walking up to her, I fl*pped her over. Angela’s face was starting to really swell. Standing over her, she looked at me with one eye. “Keep your f ucking hands and eyes off my man.” With that, I delivered one last punch that knocked her out cold. The crowd went wild as I wiped my hands off on her shirt. I was barely breathing heavily.






###Chapter 103

Chapter 0103 “WINNER, KRISTEN JEFFERYS.” I watched as Colt walked over to me and held up my hand. My eyes shifted around at all the pack members that came to watch until they landed on Alec. His eyes were filled with both anger and proudness. I could feel it through the bond. However, he didn’t come to me. Instead, he stood there, watching. It confused me. Why didn’t he come congratulate me? “Why isn’t Alec coming over?” I whispered to Colt. Colt’s eyes instantly found me as he frowned. “I’m sorry, Ice. I wasn’t aware this was going to happen.” His words confused me. “KRISTEN IS THE NEW MATE TO MY SON! AS YOU ALL KNOW, SHE IS NOW MATED AND MARKED, MAKING HER THE FUTURE LUNA OF THIS PACK. ANYONE WHO WISHES TO CHALLENGE HER, YOUR CHANCE IS NOW! SPEAK UP NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR TONGUE!” Alpha Marc boomed out. Betrayal filled me as I looked into Alec’s eyes. He never warned me. My jaw dropped at this. My eyes looked around for anyone that wanted to challenge me. I knew I put on a show but that didn’t mean there wasn’t someone that wanted to challenge me. I didn’t even know this was a normal practice here. After a few minutes of silence, Alpha Marc spoke again. “THAT’S IT! NO CHALLENGERS! LET ME INTRODUCE YOUR FUTURE LUNA, KRISTEN JEFFERYS!” A deafening cheer erupted across the field. I felt Alec walk up to me as Colt dropped my hand and walked away. Not once did my eyes land on him but I allowed him to grab my hand and raise it. Everyone went crazy as they looked at their future alpha and noveldrama

luna. Seeing Emmy come towards me, I ripped my arm away from Alec and went over to her. Her arms were out stretched for a hug. “That’s a way to kick as s!” “Thanks.” I said as we broke apart. “Nice job!” Jasper smiled as he pulled Emmy back to his side.

“Kris!” Penny was walking up with Colt and my dad. “Hey girl!” I waved at them as they approached. Penny gave me a hug, then Colt and lastly my dad. “Good job. I’m proud of you.” Dad looked me in the eyes when he spoke. Something about it made me feel accomplished. “Thanks, dad.” I smiled as I took a step back. “Good job, Kristen.” Alpha Marc came up and smiled at me. +15 BONUS Anger rose in me as I looked at him. “I was unaware you would be opening the challenge for everyone.” I said bluntly. A few of the gang looked down but dad was taken aback. “You didn’t know?” “No. I was not made aware that I would possibly be fighting multiple people.” “I’m sure you can understand. We wanted to get it out of the way. I didn’t want a surprise challenge. We were already here.” Alpha Marc looked unbothered between my dad and myself. “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be disrespectful but that is a load of c rap. If you please excuse me, I need to change for this meeting we are apparently having about Sherry.” I walked off and didn’t give them a chance to reply. I knew I might have over stepped but I doubt Alec or my dad would allow Alpha Marc to do anything to me when he was clearly in the wrong. “Kristen!” Alec yelled my name but I ignored him. If I turned around, all I would do is punch him. As I picked up my pace, I pushed all my anger to him through the bond. I wanted him to know I was p issed. Throwing the front door open, my feet echoed across the marble until I hit the stairs. He was right behind me as I bounced up each step until I got to our bedroom. The worst part, I had to unlock the bedroom door, giving him a chance to catch up. Right as I walked through, he grabbed my arm. As he pulled me around, my right h ook came with it.

###Chapter 104
Chapter 0104 “Whoa!” Alec dodged my punch. Grabbed my wrist forcefully, he kicked the door shut and pushed me up against it. His b*dy was pressed against mine. It betrayed me as the sparks sent waves of pleasure to my core. “That wasn’t very nice.” His l*ps were grazing my own “F uck you.” I whispered. “Hmm, my pleasure.” I felt his d ick harden. Using everything in me, I pushed him off of me. “I can’t believe you! First I find out that you are having this meeting about Sherry that you never spoke to me about. Then I walk in on your having a private meeting with Angela! Your dad opened the challenge to everyone and you left pis sed off this morning! Anything else I forgot?” I was yelling at him by the end of it. Alec was just standing there in all his se xiness with his arms folded over his chest. His eyes were narrowed at me as I continued my rant. “Hmm.” noveldrama

“What gives you the right to keep that s hit from me? I thought we were f ucking equals! We have only been mated for a f u cking day and you already are treating me like I am under you!” I started walking off. Pacing around the room as I kept going. “I told you from the beginning that I rather be single than be treated like I am less than! Just because I wasn’t sorry about issuing the challenge doesn’t give you the right to be pi ssy with me and walk off! You are suppose to support me! 1-” Alec grabbed my arm and pulled me towards him. Slamming his l*ps against mine, he forced me to shut up. At first I tried to push him away but it was futile. His hand was pressed against my lower back as the other hand cupped my face. His thumb shifted like he was going to choke me, which just caused a wave of pleasure through me. The fight in me was leaving me all too quickly. “You..” He placed a k*ss on my neck. He kept talking as he assault kept going. ” ready…to listen?” His hand was cupping my as s. Moving it down, he lifted my leg so it wrapped around him. My b*dy was putty in his hands. “Nnoo” I moaned as he licked my mark. Grabbing my other leg, he picked me up and walked me over to the couch. Lowering me down, he

pinned me between the couch and himself. Even I wanted to get out, I couldn’t. “Too bad.” Grabbing both of my wrist, he held them above my head. “That is for my safety.” “Get off.” I sighed. “Not until you listen to me.” Alec waited until I made eye contract with him. +15 BONUS “Fine, please try to explain the betrayal that I have been shown all day.” I pulled out my most sarcastic voice. “First off, you have known from the beginning that I hated this challenge.” “Yeah, because Angela was your girlfriend and you have wanted nothing but to protect her.” My wolf flashed before me. “Wrong.” He said firmly. He kept one hand round my wrist but the other cupped my face. His thumb gently rubbed my cheek. “I dumped her the day she was disrespectful at the pizza parlor. I didn’t even have that strong of feelings for her. That moment I k*ssed you in the club, I knew you were meant for me. I love you. I was worried about your safety, Kristen, I have never seen you fight. All I have done is watch you get hurt. Day after day, you have only known hurt. For one day, I just want you to not get hurt.” I mean, he wasn’t lying. If it wasn’t physical pain, it was emotional pain. “Hiding the meeting?” Alec rolled his eyes. “I was going to tell you about it after the challenge. I wanted you to focus on that and not the meeting. Jasper will be hearing about this.” “The meeting with Angela?” I asked through gritted teeth. “That wasn’t planned. She was released from the cells earlier in the morning. I honestly went to my office to cool off about the challenge before you went down so I could be helpful. She walked in literally one minute before you did. I never even had time to speak. She walked in and demanded I cancel the challenge.”







###Chapter 105
Chapter 0105 He wasn’t lying. That much was true. Each time he spoke, he looked me in the eyes and confessed his innocense. “Opening the challenge?” Anger flashed in his own eyes. “I honestly had no idea he was going to do that. Trust me, I will be having words with him.” “That was f ucking b ulls hit.” I said, reiterating my hurt feelings. “I agree.” He gave me a k*ss on the l*ps. “I truly am sorry.” My anger had dissipated. “What is the meeting with Sherry about?” “How all this is going to work really. She was part of the Midnight River Pack. She might have information on why they attacked your shop. You know what happened to her last night. That happens constantly over there.” The anger was back. “I can’t believe that actually happened.” My b*dy relaxed under Alec’s comforting presence. My head leaned into his hand. “I’d never allow anything like that to happen like that to you.” Alec promised.

“What did you do to those guys?” “Colt and I took care of them.” I had a feeling that was all I was going to get from them. “I don’t regret dancing with Darin.” I said looking at Alec. “I didn’t enjoy it but I saved Sherry… sorta.” Alec’s eyes hardened. “You have no idea how difficult it was for me to watch that. I was seconds from breaking his neck.” “I would have enjoyed that.” Lifting my head up, my tongue grazed his l*ps, briefly. “I enjoyed you stomping into my office and plopping yourself down on my lap.” Alec lowered his head and whispered in my ear. His own tongue traced my ear. “Next time, I won’t be gentle about it.” I promised. Lifting my leg, I pressed my knee firmly against his d ick. “Next time, I won’t hesitate to f uck you in front of whoever is in the room.” That…that was a promise. noveldrama

“Hmm, sounds like a challenge and you know how I handle a challenge.” “Is that what you want? Someone watching me shove my d ick in you?” Alec asked. “I just don’t think you would do it. That would mean you would allow someone to see me n*ked and this outfit bothered you.” Alec’s claws extended as they went down my b*dy until it reached the bottom of my shirt. Slowly, he started working his way up. “Hmm, I could always command them to look away.” “Then what is the point of f ucking me in front of someone?” I thought I had him there. “They would still hear you moan my name.” Alec whispered in my ear as his finger played with my sports bra hem. My breathing was getting heavier. “They could also hear it if you leave the window open.” I was playing with fire now. “You’re lucky dad is calling us to go to his office. However, tonight…. the window will be open.” Alec gave me a look that told me he meant business. “Better change quickly.” He k*ssed me firmly once more before getting off me. Trying not to make it sound like he even affected me, I got up and went to the closet. What to wear… it was a hot day and I wanted to shower. “Do I really need to change?” I yelled out at Alec. “No. Why? Don’t want to now?” Alec was leaning against the door frame. “I want to get a workout in and maybe run to my shop to see how things are going. It’s a hot day and I’m already sticky.” “Alright, lets go.” Alec shrugged and turned around to leave. He opened the door for me. I had a sarcastic remark on the tip of my tongue but I held it as I passed by him. Alec lifted an eyebrow like he was waiting for me to comment but was surprised when I didn’t. Instead, I had my arms crossed and walked just slightly in front of him. The humor I felt from him through the bond was rather annoying. Once we got to the office, Alec knocked once before opening the door. We were last coming in as Penny, Sherry and Luna Erin were on the far couch. Sherry was stiff and still really scared. Penny and Luna Erin were trying to calm her. Colt, Jacob, Jasper and Alpha Marc were standing by the desk. To my displeasure, An n was sitting in an arm chair a little ways off the couch.









###Chapter 106
Chapter 0106 “Now that we are all here…” Alpha Marc gave Alec a look. He seemed to not care and leaned against the wall. “Sherry, please come have a seat in front of me.” He gestured to an arm chair directly in front of his desk. Sherry visibly shook as she stood up and walked over to the chair to sit. Her head was kept downward the entire time. “Yes, Alpha.” Jacob kept his eyes on her the entire time. Outwardly, he looked ready to kill someone. “Jacob, can I please speak with you outside?” I worked it a question but it was anything but. Alpha Marc and Alec looked at me surprised but dad and Colt pointed at the door, telling him to go. I didn’t wait to see if he would follow, I knew he would. As soon as the door was shut, I laid into him.” What the hell is your problem, Jacob?” His eyes narrowed at me. “MY problem? Are you serious?” He laughed as he couldn’t believe what I just asked. “Yes, your problem! She is your mate!”

“I know that! A mate I can’t touch or she freaks out! A mate that has been raped or at least abused but she won’t tell me!” Jacob said a little too loud. “Look at yourself! I wouldn’t tell you s hit either! You look like you are ready to kill her! You whole demeanor is unwelcoming and very off putting. She needs love and compassion. All you have shown her is anger. I haven’t even been around you but three seconds and I can already tell that she is scared of you!” “I haven’t even touched her!” Jacob yelled back. “Lower your dam n voice at me. You have done nothing but scare her! Think about how you were standing in there. Your arms were crossed, glaring at her as she walked to the chair. My guess… you lost your tempter more than once with her already for being scared.” Crossing my arms, I dared him to argue.

He opened his mouth a few times but didn’t say anything. Instead, he let out a deep growl that vibrated the walls. “This isn’t what I thought it would be like.” “I know. I’m sorry this is your reality but that girl in there is scared s hitless. You are her mate and she doesn’t need to be scared of you too. You need to be her ally, her voice. You need to be understanding. and to keep your emotions in check.” “F uck!” Jacob put his hands on top of his head and walked a few steps away from me. “Ice, how am I 1/2 “By being patient and understanding. You weren’t mated to her for no reason. Trust the Moon Goddess put you with her for a reason. Be the man she needs you to be and she will become the woman you need in return.” I said softer. “This is karma for treating woman like I have.” Jacob confessed. “I mean… I wasn’t going to say that but…” I’m not a kick you while your down kind of girl but it did cross my mind. “Alright, alright. Let’s go back in.” Jacob took a deep breath. “Ready?” I said as I grabbed the door handle. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! 3noveldrama








###Chapter 107

Chapter 0107 “Yeah.” Jacob sighed. Opening the door, we had all eyes as we walked back in. Sherry gave me a look that told me she didn’t appreciate me taking her mate into the hall. Even let out a little growl before her eyes got wide and fear filled them. “Oh my! I’m so sorry!” Sherry put a hand over her mouth as her eye widened. Her face turned pale as she looked at me. “HA! You’re fine. It’s natural to be territorial over your mate.” I said as I went over and sat beside Penny and Luna Erin. Jacob went over and sat in the other arm chair beside Sherry. “Sherry, what ranking where you at the other pack?” Dad asked Sherry. “I-I was a maid. All women are maids. There is never a ranking woman.” Sherry said through her fingers as she hadn’t removed her hand yet. “What did your dad do?” Dad asked. “Um, he died when I was little but mom said he used to be a warrior.” Sherry kept her head down but her hands finally wrapped around themselves as she placed them on her lap. noveldrama

“Are you aware that the Midnight River pack destroyed Kristen’s tattoo parlor last week?” Alpha Marc asked. “Um.. I…” she started shaking all over again as she glanced over at me. Rolling my eyes, I got up and walked over to stand in front of her. “Sherry, look at me.” I kneeled down sol was below her eye level. Sherry obeyed and looked at me. Tears were in her eyes. “I want you to ignore the men.” There was some uncomfortable shifting behind me as I knew that just irritated Alpha Marc. “Just you and me, okay? You are safe here. You will not be punished for anything you say. No one here is going to lay a hand on you. You have my word that you will not be in trouble over anything you tell us. You are Jacob’s mate, which makes you one of us. We take care of each other. You never have to go back there again.” I put my hands

on hers. Sherry looked at me as talked. She really took in everything I said and relaxed a little. “Okay.” “Please, tell me what you know about my shop being destroyed.” “I-I was cleaning in the bathroom. Alpha Darin walked by with Alpha Rip and were talking about Alpha Darin and who he will take as a mate. They don’t believe in fated mates. If you aren’t what they want, they redhead. Well, I actually don’t know if he rejected her. We can hear screams from his bedroom every night. We aren’t allowed in his room. Since he found her, we have never seen her again. Alpha Darin… he told his dad he liked your spark. He wanted to make you submit to him.” Tears filled her eyes again as bile rose in my throat. “Did you hear anything else?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm. “No, once they realized I was there, they….” “That’s okay, you don’t have to tell us.” I said as I gathered my thoughts. “So there are no ranking women?” “No, even Alpha Rip’s Luna. She is the only person that doesn’t have to clean. She is in charge of making sure we do our jobs. She is beaten everyday just like we are. If we fail, we get punished and so does she.” “Okay. Do you know Penny here?” I asked looking over at Penny. Sherry followed my eyes and nodded. “She is mated to Alpha Colt.” “Correct. I am Colt’s sister. I grew up with Colt and Jacob. Penny has been my assistant for years. She has the sweetest soul. Penny is learning her role as Luna but your new role will be the female version of Jacob. Currently, he is gam ma. That makes you the gam ma female. In their pack, woman hold the same rank as their mates or vise verse. However, I think Colt and everyone would agree with me when I say that you need some time to adjust to how we do things. For the first few months, I want you to do whatever you want to do. If you want to learn to cook, go to the kitchen. If you want to garden or help with the

orphanage, then do it. Your only job is to learn a new way of life. Jacob will treat you like the princess you are. It will take a lot of patience and error but he was chosen for you for a reason. I personally think he needs a good woman to knock him around a little








###Chapter 108

Sherry gave a little laugh and looked briefly over to Jacob. “Okay.”

“Why don’t you and Penny go to the kitchen and get a snack? We will finish up here and if we have any more questions, I’ll have Penny bring you back here.”

“Yes, Ma’am.” Sherry gave me a small smile.noveldrama

“Call me Kris.” Standing up, I took her hands in mine and pulled her up. Penny walked over and put her arm around Sherry.

“Let me show you the way.” Luna Erin smiled at me and went to open the office door. Only when they were gone, did I turn around and sit down.

Jacob stood up and looked at the door. “Jacob, sit down.” I said and sighed. He listened but didn’t like it.

“Kristen…” Alpha Marc started.

“I’m sorry, Alpha Marc but she has been abused her whole life. Being questioned by a man wasn’t going to get her to open up.”

“Can I speak now?” He leaned back and lifted an eyebrow.

“Sorry, yes.”

“I was going to say, well done. I think you will make a fine luna and be good for my son.”

Alpha Marc gave me a little smile. I was still annoyed at him so I didn’t return it.

“Thank you.”

“So, about what she said about Darin…” Alpha Marc looked over at my dad.

“He cannot get away with this!” Colt looked pis sed.

“We can’t just do nothing.” Alec said dangerously calm. Looking over at him, he barely spared me a glance but kept his face passive as he looked at his dad.

“Boys, we need to be smart about this.” Dad said. “We never said we aren’t doing anything.” 

“That’s right. An eye for an eye.” Alpha Marc agreed.

“However, we need to be in the public eye so it doesn’t look like we had anything to do with it.” Colt stated.

“What if we hold a massive party at the club?” Jacob spoke up.

“Ah, yes. My son has told me so much about her.” My eyes shifted as I fought myself to stay quiet.

“That’s the issue. She is mated and marked to my son. She has no interest in your son and

I am calling to request that he stays away from her. He is prohibited from entering her tattoo parlor and engaging in conversation for any reason.”

Alpha Rip laughed. “Alpha Marc, they merely ran into each other the other day. He has had a total of two conversations with her. If he has affected her to the point that you are interfering, I must raise the question as to why that would be. Maybe he does affect her emotionally?”

“I assure you that is not the case. She is frankly disgusted by him and that little stunt he pulled at the party last night was equally heinous. I shouldn’t have to tell you that what happened was a serious overstep by your pack members in regards to Sherry.”

“Alpha Marc, boys will be boys. She is with Alpha Brian’s pack so I don’t see the need to talk about Sherry any further. As for Kristen, my son is a young adult and saw someone who intrigued him. You cannot tell me Alec or Colt have never flirted with a girl before.

Isn’t Colt’s gam ma, Jacob I think. Isn’t he a… what do the kids call it… play boy? I’m surprised he even wanted to mate with Sherry in the first place!”

“Alpha Rip, hear me loud and clear, Darin stays away from Kristen or a conversation will not be given as a curtesy again.”








###Chapter 0109
Alec POV

“She didn’t fall for that at all.” I said, looking at Colt.

“I didn’t figure she would have but I am surprised she didn’t fight me on it.” Colt sighed and looked at Alpha Brian. “We cannot let Darin get anywhere near her.”

“Agreed. That whole display at the party was a slap in the face.” Alpha Brian was finally showing his true feelings. His face was getting red and his wolf was showing.

“What do you suggest? It’s not like we can send warriors to beat him up for it. They wouldn’t stand a chance, he would have his men with him, and that would be a direct cry for war.” Dad leaned back. We were known for showing no mercy but we needed to be smart on this one.noveldrama

“He walked into her shop and asked for a tattoo.” I said to the room.

“The fuck he is!” Colt was pissed off.

“I agree, she cannot tattoo him. That is what started this whole thing anyway.”

“I think maybe we need to call Alpha Rip and have a conversation with him about her. That would be a starting point.” Dad sighed. “We can cover our bases that way.”

“Call now.” I said, a little too demanding. Dad gave me a look that told me to stand down but Colt spoke up.

“I agree. I want to hear the call.”

Dad sighed and grabbed the phone. “On speaker phone.” I said as he punched in the number.

Ring!

Ring!

“Alpha Marc. I am surprised to hear from you.” Alpha Rip’s voice bounced off the walls.

“I felt it was prudent for us to have a conversation.” Dad spoke very authoritively and professionally. “Some things have been brought to my attention that does not make me happy. I am hoping we can come to a solution.”

“What problem is that?” Alpha Rip sounded bored.

“Kristen Jeffreys.”

“Ah, yes. My son has told me so much about her.” My eyes shifted as I fought myself to stay quiet.

“That’s the issue. She is mated and marked to my son. She has no interest in your son and I am calling to request that he stays away from her. He is prohibited from entering her tattoo parlor and engaging in conversation for any reason.”

Alpha Rip laughed. “Alpha Marc, they merely ran into each other the other day. He has had a total of two conversations with her. If he has affected her to the point that you are interfering, I must raise the question as to why that would be. Maybe he does affect her emotionally?”

“I assure you that is not the case. She is frankly disgusted by him and that little stunt he pulled at the party last night was equally heinous. I shouldn’t have to tell you that what happened was a serious overstep by your pack members in regards to Sherry.”

“Alpha Marc, boys will be boys. She is with Alpha Brian’s pack so I don’t see the need to talk about Sherry any further. As for Kristen, my son is a young adult and saw someone who intrigued him. You cannot tell me Alec or Colt have never flirted with a girl before. Isn’t Colt’s gamma, Jacob I think. Isn’t he a… what do the kids call it… play boy? I’m surprised he even wanted to mate with Sherry in the first place!”

“Alpha Rip, hear me loud and clear, Darin stays away from Kristen or a conversation will not be given as a courtesy again.”








###Chapter 110
“Is that a threat?” Alpha Rip’s voice deepened.

“Take it as you want but I am protecting the future of my pack and I will not take the harassment of the future Luna lightly.”

“Let the best man win.” Alpha Rip said dangerously before hanging up.

“FUCK!” My anger finally snapped as I punched the wall. My fist went all the way through the wall.

“Our next move better be a statement.” Colt was vibrating in anger.

“Kristen doesn’t go anywhere without an escort.” I said venomously.

“Agreed. She won’t like it but she doesn’t have a choice.” Alpha Brian’s eyes were still showing his wolf. Ann opened her mouth to speak but after one look from her mate, she wisely shut up.

“Alright. You guys can head home. Alpha Brian, I will call you in a few hours with locations.”

“Sounds good.” I walked over and opened the door for them. Alpha Brian walked out, then Jacob but Colt stopped in front of me.

“Keep my sister safe.” It wasn’t exactly a threat but it was. However, I knew where he was coming from.

“With my life.” I said lowly. I doubt anyone noticed our interaction but if they did, no one said a word.

Instead, we all walked to the kitchen. Laughter was coming from inside. It was more of my mom’s voice that was the loudest but I could still make out Kristen’s. My eyes landed on all of them sitting around a table. Sherry was even smiling as mom and Kristen were telling stories. Penny was blushing and shaking her head.

“Ladies.” I said announcing our presence. I noticed Sherry instantly shut up and her face fell. Kissing the top of Kristen’s head, I sat down beside them. “What is so funny here?”

“I was telling them when Penny face planted at the school carnival.” Kristen smiled at me.

“That would have been funny to see.” I agreed.

Colt sat down next to Penny. “I remember that!” Penny blushed as she turned away from Colt.

“Did you get your update you needed?” I asked Kristen.

“Yes. Cabinets and flooring go down tomorrow. Sounds like they need more painting done so I’m going to head over now and do that.”

I glanced over at Colt. He was frowning. “I can get some people to do that. I was thinking of having a day just you and me.”

Kristen’s body stilled as she looked at me. Her eyes knew something was up. “Is that so?”

“Yeah, maybe some new recliners in the balcony.” I teased her. It worked as her skin turned red.

“Oh jeez. Well, thank you guys for coming by today!” Kristen looked over at them. Jacob was standing by the door, watching us. Colt stood up and took Penny’s hand to help her.

“It was a pleasure! I’ll keep in touch. All the prom stuff is about done as well. I called them and confirmed it all yesterday.” Penny said as Sherry stood up.

“Perfect. I will be hard to replace you.” Kristen sighed, knowing she was losing a wonderful assistant. Honestly, after what I have seen, she will be an amazing luna. Though, Kristen will still be the best.

“I know. I’m pretty awesome!” Penny faked being one of those girls and tossed her hair off to the side.

“My little girl is all grown up.” Kristen added in a fake cry.

“Okay, then.” Colt rolled his eyes and pulled Penny along.noveldrama

“Bye bro!” Kristen called after Colt.

“Let me know, Alec.” Colt said before nodding at Kristen.

Sherry gave a intimidating wave. “Thank you, L-luna Erin a-and Luna Kris.”

“You have my number. Call me anytime.” Kristen gave her a smile.

Sherry turned and walked up to Jacob. He didn’t move but his hands were crossed over his chest. Sherry looked back at Kristen before turning back around and putting a shaking hand on one of Jacob’s arms. His eyes looked down at her arm and back up to her eyes. His body visibly relaxed as he undid his arms and Sherry slipped her hand in his. Together, they walked out.








###Chapter 111
Chapter 0111 “Well, I got work to do. See you kids later!” Mom smiled at us and walked out. Kristen turned in her seat so she was straddling me. “Going to tell me why you lied?” “Can’t there be come mystery to our relationship?” I sighed as I stood up. Grabbing her hand, I pulled her with me. “No, there can’t be.” Pulling her along, we walked up the stairs and to my library. “Why are you taking me here?” Kris asked. Shutting the door, I locked. “This is a relaxing room and since I know you won’t just let me handle things, I wanted to tell you in here.” Sitting down on one side of the couch, I patted the other for her to sit. “I don’t like where this is going.” Kristen sat facing me with one leg on the couch. Her arm was resting on the back of the couch, as her hand propped up her head. “I don’t either but I told you we are equals and I meant it. For the record, I rather not tell you any of this but that is just because I want you to be happy and not be under any stress.”

“I appreciate that but get talking.” Kristen narrowed her eyes at me. “You know that Darin has developed some weird attachment to you.” I started. Kristen’s eyes instantly narrowed as I could feel she knew she wasn’t going to like where this was going. “Dad tried calling Alpha Rip to see about smoothing things over.” “Let me guess, it didn’t work?” Kristen rolled her eyes and looked out the window. “Exactly. He basically said what happened to Sherry was just boys being boys..” Kristen whipped her head around in shock. Holding up a finger, I continued. “..he said that you intrigued his son and that there wasn’t any harm to it. He ended it with basically saying, let the best man win.” “You’re joking…” Kristen looked at me appalled. “Those weren’t the exact words but yeah, that is the jist. He made it sound like Darin will not be respecting the fact that you are my mate but try to win you over himself.” noveldrama

Kristen jaw had dropped as she just stared at me. Shock, anger and fear invaded my heart from her.” That’s just crazy.” “Dad prohibited you from tattooing him. Which, just goes without saying.” “Obviously.” Kristen’s eyes widened as the sarcasm dripped off her tongue. 糖 BONUS “And you will have a b*dy guard with you at all times.” Kristen opened her mouth to argue but I put my finger against it. “Don’t even try. Colt, your dad… basically everyone is in agreeance with that. I…” I paused as I was trying to find a way to say what I wanted to in an emotional way that made her understand. “I need you to do this. For my sanity. I-I can’t lose you, Kristen. Please don’t fight me on this.” Grabbing her hands, I tried to sound as sincere as I could. It must have worked as Kristen didn’t respond right away. Instead, her eyes looked down at our hands. She was having an internal battle with herself. I was about to say something when she got up and moved so she was straddling me. With my hands on her hips, she put hers on either side of my face. “I will only agree to this if it is someone I chose.” “Love, it will only ever be me or Colt or Jasper. You get the picture. I’m not putting your safety in a random persons hands.” Cupping the back of her head, I pulled her face down to mine. Our k*ss was gentle as it was more comforting than anything. Resting her forehead to mine, her eyes were closed as she pulled comfort from our embrace. “I can’t deny that he creeps me out and I don’t like him near me.” “Let me keep you safe. Don’t leave pack lands without me. No adventures until this is settled, okay?” Kristen moved her head to my shoulder. “Okay.” GET IT NOW






###Chapter 112
Chapter 0112 That was easier than I expected. I was just staring out the window, relaxing, holding Kristen when I felt a sharp pain over my mark. My b*dy instantly got aroused as the pain was replaced by pleasure and I shot a load into my shorts. My hands clenched around Kristen as I came down from the high I just got as she was licking her mark on me clean. “What. The. F uck. Kristen?” My breathing was heavy. Tossing her off me, my shorts were sticky from my cu m. “I…” Kristen was laughing so hard that tears were running down her face. Unlocking the door, I just walked out and went straight to our room to change. Never once I ever thought about what it would mean to just f ucking mark someone. Just f ucking randomly. This meant war. “A-alec!” Kristen came into the bedroom as I was cleaning myself off in the bathroom. I had grabbed new underwear and shorts to put on. “The f uck do you want?” I asked, still slightly annoyed. “I’m sorry but I do feel like you enjoyed that.” Kristen was leaning against the door frame as I got dressed. “Plus, you promised me a full day together.”

“I did… after that stunt, lets go workout.” “A workout? I can think of other ways to workout.” Kristen tried to grab me as I walked by her. “Naw, I already got off. I’m good.” I gave her a look as I opened the bedroom door. “Well, s hit.” Kristen made a face as she walked up to me. “Figured getting you off would put you in a better mood but I guess not.” Pulling my hand back, I slapped her as s as hard as I could as she passed me. “I’m in a great mood.” “OOWWEE” Kristen grabbed her as s as she did a little twirl. “That is going to welt!” Putting my arm around her shoulders, I pulled her along with me. “We haven’t worked out together before. noveldrama

This should be fun.” “I have a feeling I am going to resent you by the end of today.” Kristen gave me a look. “Oh no, love. By the end of the day, you will be screaming my name for the whole pack to hear.” I promised as I opened the doors to the gym. There was enough people in there that Kristen didn’t answer back but the fire in her eyes told me this wasn’t over. “It’s f ucking hot out here.” Kristen said looking up. “Yes, it is. Ready?” I asked, lifting an eyebrow at her. She looked at the woods like it was her enemy. “Always.” F uck, she is stubborn as hell. However, I gave her maybe five miles before she caved. We took off in a jog until we hit our wall that lines our pack. “This is the edge. It follows the entire path around the pack.” “What? No lasers or anything protecting it.” Kristen was bent over, clutching her side. “No, just bombs and poison darts.” I said amused. “Need a break?” “Nope, just taking in all the beautiful scenery.” Kristen stood up and walked passed me. “Great, you can take the lead then.” I said allowing her to go first. I watched her sigh as she took off running on the path adjacent to the wall. Watching her tight a ss as she ran was mouthwatering. This really was the most pleasurable runs I have ever had. We ran for awhile before she stopped running and grabbed a tree. “Fine! I cave. I can’t jog anymore.” She glared at me as I was only breathing heavily. GET IT NOW







###Chapter 113
Chapter 0113 My d ick twitched watching her move up and down eight times before stepping out. “Your turn.” There was a slight coc kines s to her. Maybe I should have put more weight on there. Moving the peg to 250lbs, I got under the bar. It was mine turn to do eight reps before allowing her to do another set. She moved it back to 150lbs and did eight more like she wasn’t even struggling. However, when she stepped out, she moved the peg to 275lbs for me. “Can do you do that much, Mr. Alpha?” She put her tongue on the tip on her teeth as she was both flirting and challenging me. “With ease.” I said. It was slightly harder but I didn’t dare make a face. Returning the favor, I moved her peg to 160lbs. “Your turn to try to impress.” “Not a problem.” She squinted her face in a f uck you smile before doing the squats. To her credit, she did keep her face passive but I could feel her internal struggle. “Easy.” She said when she was done but her thigh was shaking a little. noveldrama

“Great, lets do some presses then.” I said as I moved us over to the squat press. I got on and did my set before Kristen did hers. To her credit, she kept her face passive but her legs were a little shaky. Because of that, I didn’t move her weight up but I did add an extra rep onto that. Moving on, we did some calf muscle workouts before Kristen sat down on a bench. “Here.” I had walked over and grabbed two waters from the cooler and handed her one. “Thanks.” As she took a sip, I watched her thighs shake as much as she tried to hide it. “I was thinking about going for a walk around the perimeter. It would be a good idea for you to come so you know the whole layout.” Kristen made eye contract with me. We both knew that meant miles and miles of walking. “That sounds like a great idea.” Her eye lids fluttered as she refused to cave. “Not too sore?” I asked. “Nope. I could even jog it a little.” Kristen held her head high as she continued to show no weakness.

“Good idea, let’s go.” Shrugging, I didn’t even c rack a smile as I turned and started to walk away. I could hear her sigh before she got up. She was angry with herself and I could feel her internal annoyance as we got outside. It was already a hot f ucking day. I had to slow down so Kristen was beside me as we made our way to the edge of the forest. Giving her a chance to walk before I called her bluff. Tossing my empty waters in a trash, I waited for her to finish hers and do the same. “It’s f ucking hot out here.” Kristen said looking up. “Yes, it is. Ready?” I asked, lifting an eyebrow at her. She looked at the woods like it was her enemy. “Always.” F uck, she is stubborn as hell. However, I gave her maybe five miles before she caved. We took off in a jog until we hit our wall that lines our pack. “This is the edge. It follows the entire path around the pack.” “What?

We ran for awhile before she stopped running and grabbed a tree. “Fine! I cave. I can’t jog anymore.” She glared at me as I was only breathing heavily.







###Chapter 0114

“Well, you made it six miles and I thought you would quit at five so you did do more than I expected. However, as much as your legs were shaking, I am surprised you made it this far.”

“F uck….you.” She said between a few breaths.

All I did was chuckle at her defiance. “Come on.” Holding out my hand, she took it as we kept walking.

“How are you not sore?” She asked after a few minutes.

“I’m an alpha. We don’t get tired.” I lied. She tripped at that moment but thankfully she was still holding my hand.

“Need me to carry you?”

She glared but ignored that last part. “I just haven’t worked out in a week or so and have been injured.”

“Well, my little poor luna, let me show you something.” We walked over to a deep creek that ran down our land. Where we were, there was a waterfall that opened up into a small pond before the creek opened up and it drained when it rained.

“This is beautiful.” Kristen let go of my hand and walked up to the edge of the waterfall.

“Yes, beautiful.” I said but I was looking at her. Taking her shoes and socks off, she sat down on a rock and dipped her feet in.

“This feels so good.” Tossing her head back and closing her eyes, the sun was making her sweat sparkle.

“Lets go for a dip.” I suggested.

“Do what?” Kristen looked over at me.

“Yeah, let’s go for a swim.” I said to her. I mind-linked the patrol. “Keep clear of the pond.”

“Yes, Alpha.” They knew better than to question me.

“What if someone comes…?” Kristen looked around but I was already taking my shirt off.

“No one will.” Next was my shoes and socks.

“The patrol…”

“Were instructed to stay clear.” Removing my shorts, I was standing here as s n*ked in front of her. The satisfaction of watching her eyes look me up and down sent goosebumps down my back. Taking a step past her, I jumped off the waterfall and into the pond below. The water was almost crystal clear and felt

“It’s f ucking hot out here.” Kristen said looking up.

“Yes, it is. Ready?” I asked, lifting an eyebrow at her. She looked at the woods like it was her enemy.

“Always.” F uck, she is stubborn as hell. However, I gave her maybe five miles before she caved. We took off in a jog until we hit our wall that lines our pack.

“This is the edge. It follows the entire path around the pack.”

###Chapter 115
Chapter 0115 “A sick joke. You dying is not a joke to me.” I lowered myself in the water so my hand could cup her a ss firmly. “Hmm, can I make it up to you?” Her voice was sultry as she licked my ear. One hand of hers came out of the water and gripped my shoulders for support as the other grabbed my d ick. F uck, I loved a forward woman. “You can try.” I muttered as she pushed her t its into me and moved to give me a k*ss. Her hand started pumping my already harden d ick. My hand parted her legs before I inserted two fingers into her. She gasped in my mouth and her hand stilled around my d ick as I showed no mercy. Faster and faster I moved as my thumb massaged her cl it. “Oh f uck!” She moaned as her head fell back. Moving her legs around me, I didn’t hesitate to shove my di ck in her with one motion. Her nails sank into my shoulders as she cried out. Picking her up, I moved us to another rock. Laying her half out of the water, her bottom half was still in the water but her back was resting on a rock. Giving me full access to them. Moving my motions slower, I started my assault on her t its. She had this sweet spot on the inside of her left one that really sent her into a frenzy. As I hit it, her hips buckled but I wasn’t ready for her to c um yet. Moving her up completely on the rock, her as s was just barely out of the water that I could taste her sweet juices.

“Oh! Oh! Oh!” Kristen moaned as she grabbed the back of my head to ride my face. Her legs were shaking around my head as I stopped right before she came. Grabbing her, I pulled her back into the water before slamming my di ck into her. Our rhythm matched as I pumped in and out of her. My l*ps found hers as my hands were firmly on her hips. I knew her legs were tired so I did most of the work. It wasn’t until her climax hit that I found mine. I

had every intention to ride it out but Kristen wiggled off of me and pushed me against the wall. “Wha-” I asked. She didn’t answer but kept trying to pick me up. Confused, I moved out of the water and sat on the edge. Without warning, Kristen shoved my still hard d ick into her mouth. “F uuccckkk.” I moaned as I moved so I was comfortable. She grabbed my balls to massage them as she took almost the whole thing in her mouth. Not once did she gag as she moved in and out. Faster and faster until I blew my load keep in her throat. My head had fallen back so when I looked down at her, she was licking her l*ps clean. “Fine.” I treaded water as I watched her undress completely before jumping in after me. I don’t know what it is about it but something about when a girl comes up out of water just makes my di ck twitch. “This does feel amazing.” Turning around, I was going to show her something before two hands pushed down on my head, sending me under water. For a wolf, I was a great swimmer. Turning around, I went deeper before grabbing her ankle and pulling her under with me. Kicking off from the bottom, my b*dy was jetting upward. When I broke the surface, I looked around but Kristen wasn’t anywhere to be seen. Looking down, I saw her just laying at the bottom and my heart stopped. “F uck!” I yelled before driving down to get her. Her eyes were closed and little bubbles were coming from her opened mouth. My hand wrapped around her arm and pulled her upward. As soon as I got to the surface, her head broke it as well. “Kristen!” Placing her head on a rock, I gave it a few shakes before putting my ear to her mouth, to listen for breathing. As soon as I did, something wet wiggled deep into my ear. “EWW!” I pushed away as Kristen opened her eyes and laughed. “I scared you!” She laughed but stayed against the rocks. noveldrama

Glaring at her, I swam back over to her and pinned her against the rocks. My hand went around her throat with my thumb forcing her head to look at me. “Don’t ever do that again.” My heart was still beating rapidly. Kristen placed her arms around my waist. My one hand was keeping me pushed up against her as I held onto the rocks. They weren’t sharp but there was one sticking out at the right height for us to stand up. “It was just a joke.” She sighed but looked at my l*ps. I could feel her arousal through the bond. GET IT NOW








###Chapter 116
Chapter 0116 Kristen POV That mother f u cker… my b*dy shook one last time before I picked my head up and looked into his humor filled eyes. He was trying not to laugh but his arms kept me from moving too far away. My nipples kept grazing his chest, keeping them hard. “Hmm, I did enjoy that.” A half smile finally broke free. F uck, he was the se xiest man I had ever seen. This little half smile kept my legs shaking. “I see how it is.” Pushing myself back up against him, a little water shot up from between my boobs, hitting him in the face. “This doesn’t change anything.” Blinking a few times, he moved the water off his eyes. “What do you mean?” “Nothing. Are you ready to continue our walk?” “We can’t stay here all day?” Licking my l*ps, I tried to make it obvious I wasn’t done with him as I looked. down at his.

“Hmm….” Alec grabbed the back of my neck and forced a k*ss that sent a wave of pleasure to my core. I wanted a good pounding. Yes, this was fun but I wanted more. Alec shoved me against the rocks as his finger rammed into me. “Oh YES! DON’T STOP!” I half moaned, half yelled. His hand moved harder and harder as he kept going. Grabbing my legs, he wrapped them around himself as his dic k invaded me. I was so lost in the feeling of his dic k sliding in and out that I was prepared for his finger that went up my a ss. My b*dy clenched around him. “Relax.” He whispered in my ear. This was a new feeling. Some pain but once I relaxed and his hand started moving with his d ick, I was left speechless. He filled me

completely as he f ucked my pu ssy and my a ss. Helping him out, I reached between us and played with myself with one hand as my other held on to him for support. Alec sl*pped two fingers in my a ss and I lost it. Crying out loud, a few birds flew away as Alec growled as he hit his own o rgasm. Only when we both came down, did he speak. “I think you enjoyed that.” My head rested on his shoulder. “You think so?” “Come on. Let’s get going but I promise there will be more of that.” Part of me wanted him to show me “We can dry in the sun.” I said as we sl*pped out of the water. My entire b*dy was sore as f uck. My legs wobbled and my as s was on fire. Both from the workout and his fingers. Ringing my hair out, we laid on the rocks for a few minutes before we were mostly dry. “Have you done that before?” I asked, somewhat sheepishly. “Done what?” Alec was looking up at the sun, in his own world. Although we shared the bond, it was occasionally hard for me to read him. “Came out here to f uck someone.” I didn’t even make eye contact as I wasn’t even sure I wanted an answer. Alec turned and looked at me. “No. Believe it or not, I actually saved a lot of stuff for my mate. I know I wasn’t a virgin but that doesn’t mean I did anything like this.” “Did you do butt stuff before?” “Yes.” My heart sank a little as I reached over and grabbed my clothes. “Oh.” Alec didn’t respond as he got up and got dressed himself. I beat him getting dressed. He was tying his shoe so I took the lead and headed down the trail. My hair was knotted and unmanageable. It was all I could do to braid it down the back. When I heard the twigs break, I knew Alec had caught up. This really was pretty. Birds were flying around, squirrels were running up and down the trees and the butterflies were showing their colors off. We walked in silence for a few miles, just enjoying being

outside. Looking to my right, the wall was made of stone. It went about eight feet high, like something that was built in the revolutionary times. Vinces had grown up and around part of it. noveldrama







###Chapter 117
Chapter 0117 A huge gust of wind blew and I caught the scent. My b*dy instantly froze as I became alert to my surroundings. “Kr-?” Alec started to speak but I held up my hand. “Smell that?” I asked in the mind-link. “No?” Alec looked concerned. He looked around but he was tensed and ready. “What did you smell?” “Rogues.” Alec’s eyes snapped to mine. Pointing to the wall, I motioned for him to take a look. He must have caught my thinking as he quietly walked over. Jumping up, he used his fingertips to lift himself up to the top and barely peak over. As soon as he did, he dropped to the ground, motioning for me to get down. “You’re right.” I got behind a tree and crouched down as I could hear them just on the other side of the wall. “Stay down, I got warriors coming.”

“How many are there?” “A dozen or so.” S hit. We could handle a few but not more than that. “Hmm.” “You need to quietly head back.” Alec said to me. The sound the the rogues scraping the wall echoed across. “The f uck I am! I’m not leaving you to fight them by yourself.” “I’m not allowing you to be in danger!” Alec gave me a look but I wasn’t listening. “We need to shift before they get over here.” I said to him. Not even giving him a chance to explain, I closed my eyes and called my wolf forward. I only took a few seconds before I was standing on all four paws. Sierra stood before him in all her glory. The silver shining in the sunlight. Looking over, Alec had shifted too. His wolf was massive. With matching dark green eyes, his all black wolf. Right as he shifted, a rogue had scaled the wall and dropped on the back of his neck. Without even thinking, my wolf leaped forward. Diving straight into the rogue. Sinking her teeth into his neck, he kicked off from the wall, making up barrel roll off Alec and onto the dirt. Landing on the bottom, my wolf’s fur turned red from the blood that rushed out of the dying rogue. noveldrama

The sounds of growls filled around me. Kicking the dead rogue off, more rogues had scaled the wall. Alec was fighting three at once as two had circled me. The one in front of me lunged forward as the same time the one behind me went low. Dodging to the side, my wolf was able to kick one in the face as the one in the front barely missed her snout. Suddenly, a massive weight landed on my back, almost causing me to fall as a sharp pain erupted on my shoulder. Rearing back, my wolf pinned the rogue on my back against the wall. The rogue in front of me shifted back to his human form. “Don’t f ucking kill her!” The teeth instantly came out of my shoulders. Fear washed over me as the guy started shouting orders. “This is who we want! Capture her!” My wolf went into panic mode. Making her incredibly dangerous, she went on the attack. Jumping off the rogue she had pinned, her paws landed on the rogue that shifted, slicing his neck open. Not even waiting for him to die, she lunged at the next one. Biting his thigh, she whipped him around, tossing him against a tree. Before he fell, another wolf ran at him, sinking his teeth into his neck. Our warriors finally arrived. “KEEP ONE ALIVE!” I yelled to Alec. I watched as our warriors limited the threat. The one Alec was fighting, he instantly took his teeth out and knocked unconscious. The warriors were doing the same. I was in shock. What did he mean they wanted me? Was this some bad failed attempt at kidnapping me? I mean, they only sent a dozen or so rogues? My wolf was pacing as she looked at each one. Who didn’t have their necks ripped out were laying unconscious. “Kristen.” Alec’s voice interrupted my thoughts as my head whipped around to look at him. He had shifted back and was wearing a pair of shorts. Holding up a t-shirt, he motioned for me to take it. The warriors were starting to shift back and put on their own shorts.







###Chapter 118
Chapter 0118 Grabbing the shirt, I ran off behind a tree and shifted back before putting the shirt on. It only took a few seconds but I stayed behind the tree, gathering my thoughts. It wasn’t the attack that bothered me, or the blood and dead bodies. It was what he said about me. Taking a deep breath, I walked back to the battle scene. “What happened?” Alpha Marc’s voice boomed angrily. Alec saw me and motioned for me to go to him. The warriors let me pass but more than once I sta ggered until one took my arm and helped me over to Alec. He sl*pped his arm around me firmly. “We were walking the boarder. I wanted Kristen to be familiar with our land.” “Okay, and?” Alpha Marc was impatient. “A gust of wind hit me and I smelled them. Alec looked over and confirmed there was rogues. He told me to run but I refused. Thankfully, I didn’t listen second a minute later, a rogue was on his back.” Looking up at him, I realized how scared I was of losing him. “I had shifted by then. My wolf took matters into her own hands and killed him. Next thing I knew, all the rogues had jumped over. Alec was battling three or four and then so was I.” “You’re bleeding.” Alpha Marc motioned to the blood that was seeping through the shirt. Alec pulled back

the collar and looked. “I’m fine. Anyway, one jumped on my back and bite me but another rogue shifted and told him not to kill me as I….I was the one they wanted.” Alec had ripped my shirt so he could see the bite marks. They weren’t terribly deep but they still stung.” What do you mean the one they wanted?” He growled. “I don’t know. That’s why I told you to keep one alive. I got the feeling they were after me. He literally s ‘catch her’.” I was starting to get annoyed. “I told you to run!” Alec growled. He was angry. Not really at me, but that I got hurt and I was even in

that position. “And I told you no!” I took a step back from him. “If I would have left, you would have been dead. It took your warriors far too long to respond! You were a sitting duck out here. As good as you are, there is no way you would have been able to take a dozen rogues all by yourself!” I yelled back. I was pis s ed too. “Luna, let’s take you to the hosptial.” Jasper stepped forward. He was probably the only one brave enough to speak at this moment but I think it was more to break us up. ” 1/2 “Don’t f ucking touch me, Jasper!” I pushed him away as I looked at Alec and crossed my arms. The movement hurt a little but I refused to flinch. “Okay, this is what we are going to do.” Alpha Marc held up his hands. “Take the rogues that are alive and put them in our cells. We will interrogate them when they wake up. Take care of the ones that died. Alec, are you hurt?” “No.” Alec’s eyes never left my b*dy. He was f ucking pi ss ed. “Okay, we will handle this. Kristen, go to the hospital.” I opened my mouth to protest but he held up a finger. “Your dad and brother will kill me if anything happens to you. Please, just go.” “Fine.” I slapped Jasper’s hand away as I walked away from them. “Jasper, stay here.” Alec growled before I felt him follow me. ” GET IT NOW Xnoveldrama







###Chapter 119
Chapter 0119 My adrenaline was wearing off the more I walked. Blood had stopped running down my arm and started to dry in the summer heat. Flashes of the rogue saying to his men, went across my mind. “Catch her!” He yelled. Who would want me? The only person that came to mind was Darin. The thought of being kidnapped scared me s hitles s. As I walked, exhaustion filled me as I started to crash. Stepping over a log, my foot got caught and I fell on my hands and knees. Tears started to well up in my eyes as I couldn’t hold back the small so b that escaped my l*ps. Strong hands wrapped around my waist and pulled me up and against him. Sparks erupted all over my b*dy as he placed me on his lap as he sat down on a fallen log. Alec started to rub my back. “I’m sorry.” His words confused me. “What do you mean?” I said looking up at him. A tear fell down my face. “You had to kill someone. It might have been a rogue but he was still a person.” “That is what you think is bothering me right now?” I was flabbergasted by this. “Are you not?” “No. That isn’t my first time killing someone. Do you not remember the car crash?”

“I do but you didn’t kill anyone, and there wasn’t a dozen of them.” “Alec, since I known you, I have been in three different rogue attacks now. First one when Colt got ran off the road, which I did kill someone. The second is when you got shot and I saved your as s. Now, today. I’m not afraid of rogues. I am afraid of losing you. Seeing the rogue on your back.” I shook my head as ! looked at his bite marks. They were almost healed. I guess their teeth didnt sink all the way in like mine did. “Alec, if I’m right, they wanted to kidnap me!” My b*dy started shaking as I said those words. Kidnap. It was right up there with being raped as my worst

fear. “Shh!” Alec grabbed my face as tears started pouring. “I would die before I allowed you to get kidnapped. I promised to keep you safe.” Alec wrapped his arms around me as I let the last of the terror escape me. Once I calmed down, Alec stood up and started walking with me in his arms. I didn’t even protest as he carried me. It felt like forever before we reached the hospital. The cool air hit my skin, giving me goosebumps as nurses ran forward with a gurney. “Luna Kristen, we will get you fixed up, okay?” “I’m fine, really. This is all unnecessary.” “Let them do their job.” Alec sighed as he rubbed the bridge of his nose. Sighing, I leaned back as she started pressing on my wounds. “Does that hurt?” “I literally got bit thirty minutes ago and you are asking if the wounds hurt?” I knew I was being rather bit chy but what kind of dumb question was that. “S-sorry, Luna.” She left the room rather quickly and another nurse took over cleaning the wounds. “Kristen.” Alec sighed as he looked at me. Looking over at him, his arms were folded and he was still rather pi ssed off. “I don’t want to hear it. I did what I had to do to make sure you lived. This is nothing. I’ll heal by the time prom is next week. You won’t even see the wounds.” “Do you want to call Alpha Brian or do you want me too?” “I guess I’ll do it.” I held out my hand, asking for a phone, “I don’t have mine here. We will do it when I get you home.” Alec didn’t move a muscle as the nurse worked quietly on cleaning them. After giving me a shot, she nodded from her work. “Anything broken?” She asked. “Doesn’t feel like it.” I answered moving my arm. “Up to you if you want me to take an x-ray or not.” “I think I am okay.” Sighing, I just wanted to go home. “Okay. No stitches so just try to allow them to scab over before you do anything too crazy. If you notice

any redness, come back as there might be an infection. I did give you a shot of antibiotic just in case. questions?”noveldrama







###Chapter 120
Chapter 0120 “No. I think I’m good.” “Alright, have a good rest of the day. Alpha Alec, Luna Kristen.” She gave a bow before walking out of the room. “Thank you.” I said before she fully left. Her b*dy paused but she kept going. Sliding off the bed, Alec reached out and grabbed my arm to make sure I was steady. “Let’s go.” Alec gestured for me to head towards the door so I did. This phone call wasn’t going to be a pleasant one. The whole way to the packhouse, we didn’t speak. Alec had his hands by his sides but there was like three feet between us as we walked. I felt rather exposed in my ripped t-shirt. When we got to the packhouse, there was a warrior standing outside the door. That was rather unusual but that was something I’ll tackle later with Alec. Instead, I went straight up to our room. Going to the closet, I ripped the torn shirt off and put on basic shorts and a tank top that had a built-in bra. Alec even helped move it so it didn’t scrap at the bite mark. “Let’s go to dad’s office to make that call.” Alec said as we exited the closet. “Why?”

“He was going to call him anyway about the locations.” Alec shrugged. “Fine. It’s getting late as well. Can we just have food brought up to our room and go to bed early?” “That’s fine.” Alec didn’t even look at me as he walked out of the bedroom and to his dad’s office. Alec knocked once before opening the door. “Brian, your daughter actually just walked in and she has something she wanted to inform you of.” Alpha Marc frowned. He hit speaker before putting the phone down. “Okay? What’s wrong?” Dad’s voice filled the room. “Hey dad.” I said a little timidly.

“Kristen? What’s going on?” “Dad, I don’t want you to get angry.” “F uck Kristen. What did you do?” I was a little taken aback by that. “HEY! I didn’t do anything!” I said in my defense. Alec snorted before he sat down. “Yeah, okay. Tell me what happened.” “Alec was showing me the perimeter of their land…” I started. “Good. You need to know those things.” I could picture dad nodding. “Yes, well, a gust of wind came and I smelled rogues. Alec looked over and there was about a dozen rogues. He told me to run but I didn’t listen and we had about one minute. We shifted and a rogue had already scaled their wall and landed on Alec. Sierra jumped in and saved Alec but we got bit on the shoulder in the process.” “Well, I’m happy to hear that Sierra took action but I’m at a loss why this was a big deal. You have battled rogues before. I have faith you handled it until their warriors got there.” Dad’s confidence in my fighting skills made me give Alec a ‘told you so’ look. He rolled his eyes at me. “Well, at one point. One of the rogues changed back into his human form and said, ‘that’s who we want, get her’ or something similar. Basically, they were after me.” “WHAT?” Dad’s voice echoed across the office. “As soon as I heard this, I told Alec to keep some alive. We have some of the rogues in the cells and will interrogate when they wake up.” “What is being done about my daughter’s safety?” Dad asked. “She will have a guard with her at all times. I have upped warrior posts around the pack and increased border patrol. I think once they wake up we will find they have orders from Midnight River Pack.” “You think so?” Dad asked Alpha Marc. “Alec, Kristen… why don’t you let me and Brian handle it from here.” Alpha Marc took dad off the speaker phone and turned his back to us. I hated being dismissed like that. Standing up, I walked out of the office and stomped my way back to room. “Why are you mad?” Alec asked when he got there and shut the door.

“I hate being dismissed like that.” Laying down on the couch, I leaned back and sighed. noveldrama







###Chapter 121
Chapter 0121 “What do you want for supper?” Alec asked as he went to the bathroom. “A wrap or sandwich. Whatever they have is fine. I’m not picky.” “Okay.” Alec yelled from the bathroom before I heard the shower turn on. The door was open but I wasn’t sure if I should join him or not. In the end, I decided to open the balcony door and sit on one of the lounge chairs. After a minute, I got bored and wanted a book. “Alec, I am going to the library to grab a book real quick!” I yelled into the bathroom. “Okay. Come right back!” He said sternly. “Yes, sir.” I said sarcastically but smiled at my little freedom, It was really only down the hall but still. Opening the bedroom door, I walked to the library and went inside. The smell of paper and ink is one I will never get tired of. Grabbing one, I took it and went back to the bedroom. Alec was still in the shower so I went to the balcony and started reading. “What are you reading?” Alec’s voice startled me as he sat down next to me. He was only wearing shorts. “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking. “I guess you can call it an interest.” “Space or how the universe works?” His comment surprised me. noveldrama

“Have you read it before?” “Yeah. I like how it all pieces together.” “Me too. It’s crazy to think about how there is a whole different world up there. We are merely a speck in it.” Laying my head back, the sun was just below the treeline. A knock sounded on the bedroom door. Alec got up and answered it. He came back with a cart of food Dinner is served.” Setting a plate of food down beside me on the little table, I put the book down and started eating. “Thank you.” “Yup.” We ate in silence, just watching the sun finish setting and the stars popping out. The breeze was warm

as it tossed my hair around. “I arm going to shower quickly. Get some of this blood off me.” “Okay.” Alec got up and pour himself a scotch as I went to the bathroom. The water felt amazing on my skin, even though it burned a little where I got bit. That still pis ses me off that it even happened. It felt nice to have clean hair again. After drying myself off, I went to the closet and grabbed silk pajama shorts and a matching tank. Alec was still on the balcony sipping his drink so I grabbed my own and sat on my chair. “Feel better?” He asked. “I do.” The scotch burned as it went down. “I had whiskey up there for you.” “Thank you. This s hit is gross.” Shooting the rest back, I went back in and looked through the cabinets until I found the Jack Daniel’s Gentleman. Pouring myself a glass, I went back out and sat down. “So much better.” “What color of dress do you have for prom?” Alec asked. “Black.” “Good.” “Good?” “I don’t have to buy anything new to match you.” Alec sipped his drink. “You’re welcome.” I said sarcastically. “There is only a few weeks left in school.” Alec started. Looking over at him, I waited for him to finish where he was going with this. After I didn’t respond, he kept going. “With everything that is going on, maybe it would be better to have to teachers send over our finals and just be done.” I didn’t answer. Instead, looked up at the dark sky and wish I was on some beach. In a tiny silver bikini with a drink in my hand. I want to feel the sand between my toes as the salty warm wind plays with my hair. Alec stood up and walk back into the bedroom. I heard him wrestling with something but I didn’t look. It was only after he called me name did I figure out what he was doing.

“Kristen?” Being careful not to touch or hurt me, his fingers were magic. Forcing me to release a moan against my will. As he worked on my other foot. He moved my leg open more. I was slightly confused as he didn’t do this with the other leg but his hands ran up my leg and grazed me before going back down. Moving the sheet, it laid between my legs and only covered my core as his fingers moved on both inner legs. I felt myself get aroused. However, I was so relaxed and so far under his spell that I didn’t even notice the table shake a little. Only when the sheet sl*pped off me and I felt something wet enter me, did my hip buckle and a deep moan escape my l*ps that I was holding back. Alec put his arms under my legs and reached up. Ripping the towel off, his hands grabbed my breast and squeezed. His tongue worked magic as his hand kept massaging my stomach and down to my hips. My breathing was heavy as he sl*pped off the table.






###Chapter 122
Chapter 0122 It was a massage table. Alec was putting a sheet down on it. “Yes?” “Come.” Intrigue, I got up and walked over to him. “Yes, Mr. Alpha?” “Get n*ked and get under the sheet. I am going to grab some oil.” Alec left and I didn’t hesitate. Putting my drink down, I stripped n*ked and had just got comfortable under the sheet when Alec walked back in. Tossing my hair to the side, my face was down in the holder. Alec put on some relaxing ocean wave sounds before I heard the bottle pop open. Moving the sheet down to right before my as s was showing, he moved to my head. Starting at my neck, Alec pushed down and fanned his fingers out as he got to my as s. The oil made it slide down easily as he worked his way back up. His fingers were masterpieces as he worked my back.

Alec took my arm and held it up as he moved to sit on the table too. Placing my arm over his knee, with one hand on the back of my head, he firmly grabbed a handful of my hair as he massaged my shoulder. My eyes were closed but they rolled in the back of my head as he worked me. Not once hurting my wounds, he massaged around each shoulder blade before moving down to my leg. Moving the sheet off one leg and exposing an as s, he started at my knee and firmly pushed upward to my as s. Again and again his fingers worked my muscles. At one point, his fingers roamed my inner thigh that forced me to bite my tongue so I didn’t moan out loud. Picking my foot up. He massaged my foot and calf. Taking the time to work each and every muscle. After the workout he put me through, this felt amazing. noveldrama

Coming around, I felt him push his elbow firmly into my as s from the side as he rotated my leg around. This worked my muscles in different areas that forced me to moan. Taking my leg, he arched it off to the side as he kept working the muscle. His fingers kept getting dangerously close to my core which excited me. After doing the other leg, he moved back up to my scalp. Alternating between grabbing a fist full of hair and working each part, he grabbed the sheet and covered me up. Lifting the other side, “Turn over.” He said to me. Obeying, I fl*pped over. He took a towel and covered my breast before removing the sheet. Exposing one leg, the sheet covered my vagina and other leg. Moving around my thigh, his hands circled the sheet to my stomach. Moving to my shoulder, he pressed hard as he followed the natural groove of my b*dy. Extending my arm, his hand ran down the length of my side, gliding over my side boob. Moving down my arm, he worked to the tips of my fingers. Getting very inch of my skin. Moving down to my leg, he worked my foot. Rotating them to get every angle. Once he finish, he moved to the other side. Being careful not to touch or hurt me, his fingers were magic. Forcing me to release a moan against my will. As he worked on my other foot. He moved my leg open more. I was slightly confused as he didn’t do this with the other leg but his hands ran up my leg and grazed me before going back down. Moving the sheet, it laid between my legs and only covered my core as his fingers moved on both inner legs. I felt myself get aroused. However, I was so relaxed and so far under his spell that I didn’t even notice the table shake a little. Only when the sheet sl*pped off me and I felt something wet enter me, did my hip buckle and a deep moan escape my l*ps that I was holding back. Alec put his arms under my legs and reached up. Ripping

the towel off, his hands grabbed my breast and squeezed. His tongue worked magic as his hand kept massaging my stomach and down to my hips. My breathing was heavy as he sl*pped off the table. X GET IT NOW







###Chapter 123
Chapter 0123 “Turn over.” He said huskily. My b*dy obeyed like there was no other option. The excitement and anticipation was killing me. His hands found my legs again as they were already spread for him. Alec stepped back for a second before approaching me again. This time, I heard him fumble with something before I heard something vibrate. I was about to look up, confused when he inserted it into my vagina. “Holy f uck.” I moaned as whatever he was using vibrated deep in me. His hands went back to my as s and before I knew it, his finger sl*pped inside me. “Oh Alec!” I moaned. He slowly worked me as I relaxed around his finger before he inserted a second one. His other hand started working the vibrator in and out of me, causing me to drip on the table. Only after a few minutes, he stopped what he was doing but left the vibrator in me. Taking one leg, he

moved it up before doing the same to the other. This forced my as s in the air, giving him better access to my as s. His fingers started working again but this time, there was three. I felt the table wobble as he got on it. The pressure was building from the vibrator. I heard something pop after his finger left me but what confused me was when both hands grabbed my hips. It wasn’t until he d ick touched my as s that I knew where this was going. Slowly, he inserted his di ck into me. The pressure was overwhelming but he allowed me to adjust. Reaching around, he worked the vibrator to get my mind off the pain. When he felt me relax, he started

moving his di ck in and out. “Oh ALEC!” I moaned as he reach up and grabbed a fist full of hair. His movements became harder as he began to really pound in me. “OH F U CK!” I started moaning louder. “That’s right. Say my name!” He growled as he pounded forcefully into me. “OH YEAH! YES! YES! YES!” I yelled as my climax hit. I was making a moaning sound that I had never heard before coming out of my mouth, I felt Alec c um too but he kept riding it out. Only when I came down, did he pull out. “Turn over.” When I fl*pped over, he was cleaning his dic k off before he took the vibrator out and rammed his dic k into me. Coming down on top of me, he k*ssed me passionately as my legs wrapped around him. The pressure was building up again. Right as I was about to c um, he stopped k*ssing me. “Look to your right.” His grunted. I did as i was told. Right as my or gasm hit. I moaned loudly as my eyes rolled back in my head. I became m entally aware the balcony doors were still open and he fulfilled his promise. A sharp pain erupted in my neck before it was replaced by pleasure. Stars erupted before I came down and darkness took over. I was Birds chirping was the first thing that I heard that next morning. My legs weren’t as sore as I figured they would have been. Stretching them out, last nights activities came rushing back to me, causing me to bolt up in bed. Alec was beside me, still waking up. “Good morning.” He mumbled. “Last night….” My eyes went over to the closed balcony doors. “Yes?” Alec’s c ocky voice got closer to me as his arm sl*pped around my waist, trying to pull me down. “The whole pack might have heard!” My face flushed as I feel back down against the pillow. “Possibly. I’m that good.” Alec started k*ssing my neck as I just laid there shocked. “What if your dad heard it? I can’t ever leave this room.”

“No one will even make a remark.” Alec sighed as he got out of bed. “What? Did you mind-link the whole pack and command them not to? That would be just as bad. Hey pack, if you didn’t hear me f uck your luna last night, don’t talk about it! Yeah, that would come off wonderfully.” The sarcasm was thick as Alec looked back as me and smirked.

###Chapter 124
Chapter 0124 “Come on, you have a meeting with mom in an hour.” Alec rolled his eyes as he walked to the bathroom. Jumping out of bed, I followed him in there. “A meeting? With your MOM?” He couldn’t be serious. Alec was turning on the shower, his n*ked as s wasn’t even a distraction for what panic I was feeling.” Yes, my mother.” Sl*pping in the water, he left it slightly open for me to go in. “About what?” I asked. Only poking my head in, I was still focused on this meeting. “Kristen, you have oil all over you and you still smell like S**. Do you want to shower before you see my mom?” “It’s weird when you call me Kristen.” I grumbled as I got under the water. Alec moved out of the way so I could start washing myself. “What would you like me to call you? I haven’t been granted permission to call you Ice. Kris just doesn’t sound right. Plus, Kristen is your name.” I liked how he called me love but I didn’t want to say that. “Call me whatever your little heart wants to.” I grumbled. “What is this meeting about?” noveldrama

“Your luna ceremony.” Alec was shampooing his hair as he answered me. I had to blink a few times before that really sank in. Grabbing the b*dy wash, I started cleaning the oils off of me. Luna ceremony? I mean, I guess I knew I would have one. “Oh.” “It’s more of a commitment ceremony. You will denounce your ties to your dad’s pack and become part of ours. When I get made Alpha, we will have a joint ceremony.” I had no words. The whole thing made me nervous and excited. I would officially be away from An n. With everything that was going on, I completely forgot about denouncing ties to my dad. Part of me already felt like I didn’t belong there anymore so it wasn’t really a thought. Alec’s hand grabbed my face and pulled it up so I was looking at him. “Is that okay?”

“Y-yeah. I forgot about that part. I guess when we mated, I stopped feeling like I belonged there so it really wasn’t a thought.” Alec leaned down and gave me a soft k*ss to my l*ps. “You belong here now.” Alec rested his forehead against mine as he spoke to me. “Yeah, you are stuck with me.” Giving him one last k*ss, he leaned up and allowed me to finish showering “What else are we doing today?” I asked as I toweled dried off. “Figured you would want to go to your shop.” Alec sighed. “I do but what about the rogues. I want to be there when you interrogate them.” Alec didn’t answer as he shut off the shower and stepped out. “Why?” “If it about me, I have every right to know. Plus, I will cooperate better if I am fully aware of what is happening.” I tried to reason with him. “I’ll tell you what, Colt will be at the shop. If he agrees, then you can go.” Alec wrapped the towel around his hips as he walked out of the bathroom. Well sh it. Colt has never wanted me anywhere near the cells. Standing in front of the mirror with my towel around me, I just started brushing my hair. Thinking of ways I will be able to convince Colt to allow me to do it. After applying a light layer of makeup and taking the time to blow-dry my hair, I straightened it and decided to put on a sundress. Alec was texting on his phone when I came out of the bathroom. “Almost ready?” Alec asked without looking up. “Yeah. Let me get dressed. Who are you talking to?” It wasn’t jealousy that was sp iking but the fear that he would talk to Colt first and I never have a chance to plead my case. Mrs. Smith Thank you all for reading! 1 ”







###Chapter 125
Chapter 0125 Alec walked into the closet as I put on a bra. “Your wounds look good.” My eyes traveled to them. They looked days old and it felt completely normal. “Don’t avoid the question.” I glared at him. Grabbing an light weight romper, I grabbed sandals and started buckling them. “Colt texted asking when you would be there.” “Did you tell me about the rogues?” “No, I didn’t.” He even held his phone out so I could see the messages. Moving closer, I read each message and never once did Alec even mention the rogues. “Thank you.” I said, satisfied. “Can we go now?” Alec asked.

“Yeah.” I think I surprised Alec when I sl*pped my hand in his. I’ve never been one to initiate physical contact. The look on Alec’s face when he glanced down, mixed with his surprise that filtered through me, put a smile on my face. Alec gripped my hand back as he shut the bedroom door. To my surprise, he walked me straight to the library. “I thought we were meeting your mom?” “We are.” Alec let go of my hand and opened the door for me. The smell of sandwiches, fruit and flowers hit me in the face. Luna Erin had transformed the library into a brunch and planning area. “Ah! You are right on time!” She came forward and gave me a hug. I was so shocked that I almost forgot to hug her back. Up until this point, I had very minimal contact with her. “What is all this?” I asked with a smile on my face. “Well, we need to plan your ceremony! So, I took this time to have a brunch and we can spend some time to get to known each other.” She looked around before looking back at me with so much hope on her face.

My mouth was open but no words came out. I’ve never had a warm motherly figure in my life. My eyes looked at the beautiful arrangements she had set up. All the bowls of fruit, salads and a try of different foods. There was even a table of different deserts. When Alec’s hand rested on my lower back, I jumped a little as the sparks pulled me out of my shock.” BONUS “What else are we doing today?” I asked as I toweled dried off. “Figured you would want to go to your shop.” Alec sighed. “I do but what about the rogues. I want to be there when you interrogate them.” Alec didn’t answer as he shut off the shower and stepped out. “Why?” “If it about me, I have every right to know. Plus, I will cooperate better if I am fully aware of what is happening.” I tried to reason with him. “I’ll tell you what, Colt will be at the shop. If he agrees, then you can go.” Alec wrapped the towel around his hips as he walked out of the bathroom. Well s hit. Colt has never wanted me anywhere near the cells. Standing in front of the mirror with my towel around me, I just started brushing my hair. Thinking of ways! will be able to convince Colt to allow me to do it. After applying a light layer of makeup and taking the time to blow-dry my hair, I straightened it and decided to put on a sundress. Alec was texting on his phone when I came out of the bathroom. “Almost ready?” Alec asked without looking up. “Yeah. Let me get dressed. Who are you talking to?” It wasn’t jealousy that was sp ik ing but the fear that he would talk to Colt first and I never have a chance to plead my case.

###Chapter 126
Chapter 0126 Is that the one you like?” I heard Luna Erin’s soft voice beside me. “My wolf, Sierra. She is silver and Alec’s wolf is black. This feels right.” I heard Alec stand up and come over to look at the picture. 1 think you made a great choice.” Alec’s arm ran up and down my back, sending sparks through out my b*dy. Looking up at him, I knew he felt my uncertainty. “I’m so excited about this! I just bought new white linen and I’ve been anxious to use them!” Luna Erin took the picture and went to sit down. She pulled out a massive bider that was overflowing with different samples. Alec gently pushed me back to the couch. I have options as far as designs for center pieces and decorations. Alec had told me about you planning all the school activities. I know you have quite the knack for this kind of thing. It’s really whatever you want. We can mix match different designs or really whatever.” She was fl*pping pages around. She really did have a swatch for each fabric or color. My number one pet peeve when it came to events like this was the centerpieces. Most of them are so exuberant that you couldn’t even see the person on the other side. Plus, no one even remembers what the center pieces even looked like after the event. “Just a vine of Baby’s Breath in the middle of each table with black candles sticks.”

“Perfect. What about fabrics?” “I am not a fan of satin. I like more of a matted look.” “I actually have a black runner with a silver center but it is sparkly.” Luna Erin shifted through her book. until she pulled out a picture of what she was talking about. “I don’t mind sparkles but that might be too much with the Baby’s Breath.” “You’re right. I’ll save this for the accent tables?” “Sounds good.” I nodded in agreeance. “Great. Anything else you want?”

“Can we do an evening thing? Line the tent with solar lights that come on when it gets dark.” “Of course!” Luna Erin pulled out different tent options they have and if we wanted walls or not. There was examples of how the dance floor would be laid and made into a stag stage. “That all looks good.” I nodded as you can only have so many options with a dance floor. “We can buy a different style if you don’t like these.” “Oh no. Use whatever you already have. There is no reason to waste money like that.” “These are options we have already used for signs. Again, we can do something different if you don’t want any of these.” There wasn’t really any that matched my theme or that I could make match. “Can we get pieces of wood and paint them black. I took calligraphy classes. I can write each sign.” “That’s very doable!” Luna Erin smiled at me. I would like to have a set meal planned and not do a buffet style if that’s okay. I have a level of expectations for my events and people always rave about my food.” That made me cra ck a smile. “Of course, “So, over here.” Luna Erin stood up and showed me the different food options. “For appetizers, I have. prepared these three different options. First one is smoked tuna and goat cheese crostini. Second on is a chipotle meatball, topped with a slice of avocado, in puff pastry. Last one is a crispy stuffed mushroom.”” They all looked so amazing. I’ve never been one to shy away from trying new things but if I had read the descriptions at a restaurant, I would not be ordering these. All these were big enough that it took a few bites of each to try but they were still small enough that you would normally get a few on a plate. Picking up the tuna, I didn’t hesitate as I took a bite. Alec followed suit. “Have you not had these?” I asked him. He shook his head no. It was absolutely amazing. The tuna had a perfect smoky favor. The goat cheese gave a little sweetness against the crunch of the bread.noveldrama








###Chapter 127
Chapter 0127 Taking a a meatball, I loved the presentation but I was not a fan of avocado. Taking that off, I put the meatball into my mouth. The meatball had a s picy but juicy favor. The puff pastry was nice a flaky. Alec put the whole thing in his mouth and nodded as he kept chewing. “Do you not like avocados?” Luna Erin asked. “No but these are delicious.” Setting the toothpick and avocado down, I picked up the mushroom. Taking a bite, the stuffing wasn’t mushy like I expected but pieces of crispy bread crumb mixed with a sweet jelly. The mushroom was baked with a brown sugar coating that made it perfect. “So, what do you guys think?” Luna Erin looked at Alec and I with so much hope in her eyes. I “They are all really good, mom.” Alec said with a mouthful of food. I knew what I wanted but I was afraid. to tell them. “What’s wrong?” gat

Looking up, he was looking at me confused. “If you don’t like any of them, I can do something different.” Luna Erin looked worried. “Oh no! That isn’t it. They are all so wonderful, “Kristen, what do you want?” Alec said after a few seconds of me not responding. “I want them all.” Grabbing the rectangle plate that had the tuna on it. Removing all but one, I grabbed one mushroom and one meatball and put them evenly on the plate. “We can make the meatballs smaller and cut the tuna smaller so they stretch further No one spoke for a minute. Looking up at Luna Erin and over at Alec, they both had a surprised look to

their face. “I hadn’t even thought of that.” “If that is too much work, we don’t have to do that!” I said quickly. “That is not too much work at all! I love that idea. This might be my best event yet!” Luna Erin smiled as she moved us down to the next table. She again had three different options. My mouth watering just smelling each option. They were all covered with metal covers. Taking them off, my eyes widened at how amazing they all looked. “Usually, I have two options. I have prepared a few different things to try. The first one is a duck confit over a bed of mash potatoes. The second is stuffed eggplant with black bean sauce. Third is maki and nigiri sushi. Fourth is a roasted rack of lamb with a side of mashed cauliflower. Lastly, that one is beef wellington. Alec cut us off a bite of each. Each one was mouth watering in its own way. “What do you think?” Alec asked me. “I didn’t like the eggplant. The duct and lamb are similar.” I was thinking through my options. “The beef is nice and juicy.” Alec kept going. “Yeah but it is going to be hot. Maybe the sushi for a lighter option. I think I like the duct better but just barely.” “I agree, those are great choices.” Alec nodded. “This is going great!” Luna Erin smiled as I took another bite of sushi. “These are really great.” “I’m so glad you lik you like them.” Luna Erin smiled at me as she moved to the next table. “I like to have a salad after the appetizer. However, I usually just have the one option. So, I have prepared three options. First one is a stacked Waldorf salad. Next one is summer salad with berries and goat cheese and pine nuts. Last one is a cranberry pear salad with fresh onions and walnuts.” The waldof salad was slices of apples, topped with walnuts and cheese crumbles. The Granny Smith apples looked divine with the vinaigrette. Alec cut up an apple slice. Putting a bite on a fork, he held it up for me to eat. The apple was both sweet and tangy. However, it was just a fancy apple. noveldrama

“What do you think?” Alec asked as he took his own bite. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! I love hearing your thoughts! Please leave a 5 star review so I can get this book rated! 8







###Chapter 128
Chapter 0128 “Eh, it’s an apple.” I said shrugging. “Still good though.” Grabbing a fork, I tasted the other two salads. “The Summer Salad is really good.” “I like the Cranberry Pear better myself but both a good.” Alec said as he finished his bite.. “Well, it’s not your party” your party.” Luna Erin laughed as she wrote down Summer Salad. “Last is deserts!” “There is a Chocolate Pistachio Dome. When you cut into it, there is German Chocolate mouse on a bed of bro wnie with Chocolate gnash. This is a Passionberry Parfait with a graham cr acker crust. This is a Lemon Tart topped with raspberries. This last one is a Blueberry and Lemon Cake Shooter.” Alec cut the chocolate dome and fed me a bite. The chocolate melted in my mouth and made me moan. in response. “This is so good.” I said with a mouth full of chocolate. “I think she heard you moan enough last night. Do that again and I’ll take you right here in front of her.” Alec mind-linked me. I was sw noveldrama

swallowing the chocolate and I instantly started choking. “Oh dear! Are you okay?” (Cough, Cough!) My eyes were watery. “I’m good. Went down the wrong pipe.” Ignoring Alec, I moved on to the Passionberry Parfait. It was good but I wasn’t excited about it. It was crea my and rich. One of those things that you could only eat half of because it was so rich. Trying to Lemon Tart, it was just that… tart. However, if you were a lemon fan, this was for you. The tart itself was sweet and smooth. The graham crac k er crust really brought it all together. The raspberry helped break it up. Still, I hated lemon. The blueberry and lemon shooter was amazing. The cake was nice and moist. Not too much frosting between the layers. It was smaller and after a few bites, it was gone. However, I would eat two of these and be okay with that. The lemon wasn’t so overpowering. “What do you think?” “I love the chocolate dome. This blueberry and lemon is good.” I said.

“The passionberry is my favorite.” Alec mumbled as he took another bite. “Should we do three deserts too?” Luna Erin asked. She grabbed another plate and positioned those three on it. “That would be amazing!” I was starting to get really excited about this. +15 BONUS Alec cut us off a bite of each. Each one was mouth watering in its own way. “What do you think?” Alec asked me. “I didn’t like the eggplant.

###Chapter 129
Chapter 0129 “Thank you. I enjoy that kind of thing.” I had to stop myself from moaning again as I took another bite. Alec raised an eyebrow at me but I tried to avoid his eye contact. “What else do you like to do?” “I enjoy being busy. I don’t like having a random day of nothing. So, I just do whatever that will fill my day. These last few years, I organized the school activities.” “That’s wonderful!” “Well, I guess I plan them and I do actually do some of it but I have people that work under me that! delegate to. Actually, Penny, my brother’s mate was my personal assistant. I’ll be in the market for a new one now.” “Who do you hire?” Luna Erin seemed really interested in my work. “Well, the people I have hired are usually scholars like myself that don’t have a creative way to express I themselves. Maybe even get into trouble because they aren’t being pushed or given the opportunity to excel.” noveldrama

“You have such a kind soul.” She finished her salad and set the bowl down. “What do you want to see change around here?” The last bite of desert was inches from my mouth when she asked me that. My b*dy froze as her question seeped into my ears. “Change?” I asked before finishing the bite. “Yeah! Have you seen anything in our pack you want to change?” “Oh… um… I honestly haven’t thought about it. There is still so much I haven’t seen. I know when I helped. Emmy, she wanted to do a few things.” “She showed them to me and we have actually started on her ideas!” “Oh wow! That’s amazing!*

“We are very open to new ideas. Growth after all is vital to making sure the pack is successful. If you have ideas that you think will help grow the pack, please let me know. As you start stepping into the luna roll, I will be here to really help you. However, from what I’ve seen, you are already mastering it. You have a natural ability to comfort those who need it. Plus, you have zero concern about standing up to Marc!” “Oh, was Alpha Marc upset?” “Great! So, you guys can eat whatever you want now. Anything that isn’t ate will just get tossed so please help yourself to any of it. I am going to go write this down and I’ll be back!” Luna Erin smiled as she ski pped out the door. Goi ng over to the sushi, I took the plate and went over to the couch to sit down. “I’m surprised you didn’t eat the chocolate.” Alec smirked as he grabbed the duck. “I rather not be n*ked when she gets back.” I grumbled as I shoved a sushi into my mouth. Alec sat down and raised an eyebrow. “So, did you enjoy last night?” “I did actually.” “Which parts did you like?” Alec put a bite of duct in his mouth. “The massage was the best part.” I teased. “Oh really?” He raised an eyebrow at me. “Yeah. Your fingers are talented.” I put another roll in my mouth. “I see.” Alec said as his mother came back into the room. “I got everything lined up! What are your plans for the rest of the day?” She asked as she grabbed the cranberry pear salad and sat down. “Going to the shop to see how the progress is.” I said before I ate the last bite of sushi. Standing up. I went to put the plate back before getting the chocolate desert. “Ah! I hope it is coming along good! Did you have many clients you needed to reschedule?” “I did. I’m usually booked out a few weeks.”

“That’s wonderful. What made you want to go into tattooing?” “I love to draw and come up with designs. It was a creative way to earn money and get out of the packhouse for awhile.” “I can’t believe you managed to run and create such a successful business!” Luna Erin praised me.









####Chapter 130
Chapter 0130 I felt Alex place his hand on my lower back as he sat forward. There was an instant calming to his touch but my anxiety was still flying high. “Mom, we discussed this.” “You discussed what?” I pulled back from Alec and looked between them. “You will continue tattooing and will not be giving that up.” His voice was firm. They want me to stop tattooing? .we “You misunderstand, Alec. No, we do not wish for her to stop tattooing.” Looking directly at me, “yes, had a discussion about the shop taking too much time away from your duties here. However, Marc and i have spoken and we are wanting to discuss something with you two.” She paused as she shifted in her

seat. “Like what?” Alec’s voice was restraint anger. “With everything that is going on, Marc is not quite ready to step down as Alpha. I know we had discussed him stepping down when you found your mate or waiting till you are older. You have shown us that you are ready without a doubt but since your mate seems to have a target on her back, maybe it’s best we wait till things settle down. We also think that this would be a great time for you to take a vacation together. School ends in two weeks. Why not go to the beach after graduation? Take that trip to Italy. After you take over the Alpha and Luna roll, there won’t be time for you guys to do any traveling. As far as the tattoo shop, we did hope that you would be interested in expanding it, hiring more artist but you will not recieve any pushback from us as long as the luna duties are still getting done. You have shown us that you are capable of handling multiple things at once.” “So, I am keeping Alec from getting the Alpha position?” I was hurt. I knew me ntally what she was saying but emotionally, that really stung. “It was never set in stone he would recieve the alpha title once he found his mate. Even if this wasn’tnoveldrama

going on, Marc would still want me to train you for some months to a few years until he stepped down.” “So, then why even tell him he would get the title if you weren’t prepared for that?” I was getting angry. “Kristen, you are the daughter of an alpha. I’m sure you can understand things change everyday? I believe it was your father’s intention to wait till Colt was 25 before he stepped down. After a few public displays by Luna An n, do you honestly think he won’t be pushing Colt harder so he is ready sooner?” I was already sitting up straight but this stiffened my back even more. I didn’t appreciate her speaking about this. It might be true but that would mean dad could loss his mate if he breaks his mate bond. Now, he could simply step down but that would not get rid of An n. “Kids, listen. I know this isn’t what you were wanting to hear. Kristen, I am beyond happy you hare Alec’s mate. You are going to be an amazing luna and I think you are the perfect match for Alec. Being alpha and luna is a huge commitment. We want you guys to be able to enjoy some fun before you are tied down to this role. Travel and spend time with each other. Get to know each others habits and desires. Let Marc and Brian take over handling Alpha Rip. We are not excluding you, you both will be involved in any and all information.” Mrs. Smith Author Η Thank you all for reading!







###Chapter 131
Chapter 0131 I’m not sure if shocked was the right word to explain what I was feeling. I did understand what she was saying but I couldn’t help but feel hurt. They were keeping Alec from being alpha because Darin wanted me. My eyes dropped to her half drank tea. The dirty brown water reflected how I felt. “What aren’t you saying, mom?” Alec spoke firmly. “Watch your tone.” Luna Erin glared right back. “At the end of the day, Darin wants Kristen. Marc and my concern is that he will challenge you for her. If you are alpha and luna, that might include that position. We don’t want him to be able to challenge for them together. If he wants to challenge the alpha, that is one thing but if she is the luna….” That would include the pack too. It was like a slap in the face. “Anyone could challenge for that at any time.” Alec didn’t change the attitude in his voice. “Why wasn’t dad here for this conversation?” “Sometimes you dad can be…. too aggressive. This wasn’t meant to upset you but we did want to be transparent with you two. You deserve that much. I’m sorry we are in this position. I want nothing more than for you two to take over and be happy. We still have a pack we have to run and protect. This isn’t want I wanted for either of you but we are trying to make the best out of this situation. You wanted to travel, we will cover the cost. Please just think about it?” Luna Erin stood up. “I will see your choices get honored for your commitment ceremony. We will need to have a dress fitting soon. Let me know what you both have decided.” She walked out of the library and quietly closed the door. Alec stood up and started pacing with his hands on his hips. “Did you know?” I asked quietly.

“No, I swear. They had asked if you were wanting to travel and if you still planned on tattooing. I told them I wasn’t sure about the traveling since we never spoke about it but I told them you would be tattooing still.” Alec turned and looked at me. “I’m so sorry.” Alec came up to me and kneeled in front of me. Taking my hands in his, his eyes searched

mine. Pulling my hands free of his, I slid around him and stood up. I knew that action hurt him as if filtered through the bond but I didn’t even know how I felt about it all. She wasn’t wrong but it was still like I got stabbed in the back. I was keeping Alec from being alpha. My brain was sca ttered as I kept trying to figure out what I was feeling and how I wanted to respond to this situation. “Why don’t we head to the shop to see the progress?” I said finally. Alec didn’t say anything but got up and opened the door for me. He was more angry than anything but ! couldn’t tell where it was directed. My best guess was at his parents. Probably a little from me rejection opened the car door for me and waited until I got in before closing it gently. However, he slammed his door shut and floored the gas as he took off. Between his emotions and my own, I wasn’t sure what to do. Taking their offer of a vacation seemed wrong. As much as I wanted to look over at Alec, I kept my eyes out my window. The trees were flying by, helping me push everything out from my mind. Resting my head against the head rest, I forced my emotions to shut down. I didn’t want to think or feel. Turning my attention to my shop and what that was going to look like in the future. Alec had to d to park down the street since there was so many cars parked on the street. As soon as he turned off the car, I opened my own door and got out. The wind was blowing, making me smell the sawdust. It was a smell that said they were making progress. Alec came up to me but didn’t try to touch me.noveldrama








###Chapter 132
Chapter 0132 Taking a deep breath, I just nodded and slowly walked towards my shop. Right as we approached, Penny and Colt stepped out. “I wondered when you two would get here.” Colt held out his hand to shake Alec’s. Ignoring them, I peaked into the shop. It was looking amazing. “Ice?” Colt put his hand on my shoulder. “What?” Snapping back to him, his eyes narrowed. “What’s wrong?” Colt looked into my soul, which annoyed me in this moment. “Nothing.” I said and shrugged his hand off and started walking inside. “I don’t think so.” Colt grabbed my arm and pulled me back. Not painfully but enough that made me stop. “What is wrong?” For some reason, I felt like Colt didn’t need to know about what just happened. “Alec doesn’t think I need noveldrama

to be in the interrogation of the rogues. I said I want to be there.” It wasn’t a lie but it wasn’t exactly the truth. I was irritated about that. Colt let go of me but kept studying me. “Why do you want to go to that?” “I want to know why they are after me! If this whole f ucking thing is about me, I have every right to know!” My own anger was rising but it was feeding off Alec’s too “Calm down. We can discuss this without getting worked up.” Colt held up his hands after I bit his head. off. It was all I could do to roll my eyes and stomp inside the shop. The floor was down, walls had fans on them as the paint dried. There was different people putting together my desk and chairs. This helped my mood, I should be able to place an order in at this rate and be able to tattoo soon. The green I picked out was perfect, really fit what I was going for. This felt like

me The only thing that caused any kind of weirdness was the extra chairs. There was a total of three tatt chairs with a half wall dividing them, “What do you think?” Penny’s voice interrupted my thoughts. Looking back, the boys were watching me as Penny walked up towards me. “I think you are doing a great job. Looks like I need to put an order in.” “Already did that! It should arrive on Wednesday, I believe. Maybe sooner.” Penny frowned as she tried to recall when it was suppose to be.. “You are truly amazing.” I gave her the best smile I could muster at this point. “Are you okay? You seem kind of down. Do you not like something?” Penny started looking around unsure. “That’s not it at all. I think you are doing a perfect job.” “You sure?” Penny narrowed her eyes at me. It was actually a little annoying with how much she was pushing. “I’m fine, thank you.” I tried to hold back my annoyance but I think she understood as she walked back to Colt. He put his arm around her. As much as I tried to ignore them, all three of them were looking at me. My back was turned to them but the mirror didn’t hide anything. My boiling point was coming to a head. I wasn’t a f ucking show or a barbie that they could decide how I was going to move or act. No, I am going to go home, put on something to work out in and break a punching bag. Then I was going to break someone’s jaw. The hell what Colt or Alec thought. Turning, I kept my head high as I walked towards my audience. I saw Colt mouth the words, ‘oh f uck me before shaking his head. Alec glanced over at Colt but was clearly confused. “We are leaving.” I said firmly to Alec as I walked past him. It wasn’t until I had my hand on the car door that Colt yelled at me. “Ice, can we talk about this?”

“I’m f ucking done talking.” Glaring at him as I threw the door open and got in. Alec wasn’t too far behind. me so I didn’t have to wait long before he got in. Starting the engine, he drove annoyingly slow back to the packhouse. GET IT NOW







###Chapter 133
Chapter 0133 Keeping my arms folded for the entire ride, Alec didn’t even try to touch or talk to him. Which, half way annoyed me more. However, I felt more like being left alone. There was a few times that Alec’s phone went off but even though I was curious, my desire to not talk to him was stronger. Pulling into the packhouse, my door was open before the car even stopped rolling. “F uck, Kristen.” I heard Alec mutter as my legs power walked inside. “Kristen!” My dad’s voice surprised the hell out of me, causing me to almost trip over my own foot. “D-dad?” Luna Erin, Alpha Marc and Luna An n were all standing around in the foyer talking. There was some pack members filtering in and out but otherwise not paying any attention to the alpha’s. “Can you not remember your manners! I swear, I did not rai-” An n started a rant. Unfortunately for her, my mood was very poor. Without even thinking, my right fist pulled back and connected perfectly with her chin. Instantly knocking her out cold. I immediately knew I f ucked up but I wasn’t waiting around to hear about it. I kept walking. Not even acknowledging dad or anyone else. There were many gasps echoing across the foyer. People moved out of my way as I ran up the stairs. There was so much rage in me that tears had threatened to spill. It took me a few tries to unlock the bedroom door but it finally sprang open. Throwing it shut behind me, I expected to hear it slam shut but it never came. Glancing back, Alec had sl*pped in behind me. Putting my hands on my hips, I waited for him to start yelling at me. Instead, he went over to the bar and poured two whiskeys before grabbing both cups and the bottle. Placing them on the coffee table, he sat down on the couch. With one hand over the back of the couch and his leg crossed, he sipped his drink as he looked at

me. After a minute, he leaned forward and pushed the other cup towards me. I I was so confused. I expected to be yelled at, maybe even punished but he was offering me a drink? Maybe this was the calm before the storm. Cautiously, I walked up and shot the whole thing back before

setting it down. Alec leaned forward and poured me another. Shooting that one back, I was tired of waiting. “Where is all the yelling?” “I’m not going to yell at you.” Alec said in an unusually level tone. “Why?” This time, I filled up my own drink. “Nothing to yell at you for.” Alec shrugged as he got comfortable again. I didn’t know how to react to this. Do I sit? Keep standing here? After shifting awkwardly for a few more minutes, I eventually took a seat on the other side of the couch, no where close to touching Alec: “How “You can literally feel my every emotion.” It sounded more b itchy than I intended. “True but I would like you to explain and tell me what you want to.” “Well, Dr. Phil…” I said sarcastically. “Don’t f ucking do that.” Alec’s eyes narrowed at me. I knew he hated when I used sarcasm against him but there wasn’t much for caring about people’s feelings right now in me. “What do you f ucking want me to say?” My anger was rising again. Standing up, I started pacing as the word vomit started spilling. ” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading and for the reviews! 6noveldrama

However, my thinks I shouldn’t worry about that or be involved in their questioning because I am girl. My future mother- in-law doesn’t want me to be luna yet or allow her son to be alpha because of me. All because they are worried you will lose the challenge to Darin. So I am keeping everything at a stand still just because 1 exist. Then, I thought I had finally escaped An n by being mated to you and I was safe here from her verbal abuse, only to find out that was a f ucking lie. So I just f ucking snapped, OKAY? I can’t take it anymore. am not a f ucking doll that needs to be babied. I have been trained as a warrior my entire life. I have witnessed just as much as you have! Just because I have a f ucking vagina doesn’t mean I don’t deserve equal treatment!” Without thinking and using all my strength, I threw the glass against the wall. Watching it shatter into hundreds of pieces reflected my heart. 1 Alec leaned forward and pushed his drink over to me before leaned back again. Staring at the drink, the confusion won out. “W-what?” “Have a drink.” Alec said calmly. “I don’t want another drink.” I felt my anger leaving my b*dy as I felt his calmness. The half of bottle of whiskey I just put down was helping too. “No one is mad or upset at you.” Alec rested his head in his hand as he watched me. “Why not?” I literally punched a luna in the face. Why am I not in trouble.

“Couple reasons. Firstly being you do not belong to that pack and she clearly disrespected you. You had every right to handle that as you saw fit. Secondly, she had it coming. Honestly, I’m surprised you didn’t do that sooner.” Alec stood up and walked over to me. Putting his hands on my shoulders, they moved down my arms. “I am so proud of you. You finally put her in her place. It’s up to you. You can ban her from

ever coming here if you want.” “B-but your dad….Luna Erin…” I was having a hard time wrapping my head about this. “Think she deserved it. Your dad wasn’t even that upset.” Alec put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. “Everything is okay.” I opened and shut my mouth a few times as Alec stroked my cheek. It was calming me as he pushed calming feelings into me as well. “I still want to be there when they interrogate the rogues.” I said, stubbornly. “Okay.” Alec said, simply. “Okay? Just like that?” I looked at him, waiting for the other shoe to drop. “Like you said, if you didn’t have a vagina, you would have been in there without question. Don’t blame me for trying to protect my girl. I forget you are just as strong as the boys “Good.” I wasn’t sure what else to say. “After that, do you want to go up to the land and check on the progress of the event center that is being built?” Alec asked, slightly hopeful. A bike ride, yes please. “That would be okay.” I tried not to sound too eager but Alec saw right through that. He tried to hide a smirk as he pulled me into a hug. Resting his head on the top of mine, his chest vibrated with humor. The more he found the situation funny, the more I relaxed. Alec finally let me go but took my hand as we walked out of our bedroom and down to Alpha Marc’s office. There was a twinge of embarrassment over my actions but at this point, it was mostly feeling smug. That bit ch deserved what she got. Alec knocked twice before opening the door and pulling me inside. Dad and Alpha Marc were talking. An n was sitting on a chair with a bag of ice over chin. Luna Erin was standing behind Alpha Marc.. “Come here, kiddo.” Dad opened his arms for me to come to him. My legs more faster than I expected. There will nothing be like the embrace of your parent for comfort. GET IT NOWnoveldrama







###Chapter 135
Chapter 0135 Don’t hug that bit ch!” An n shrieked as she glared at me with one eye. “Keep talking and I’ll make the other side match. This is MY pack and you will not be disrespectful to me. One more word out of your mouth and you will be banned from these grounds.” I said as I kept my hands around my dad’s waist. “You wouldn’t band your father!” An n looked shocked. “No, I wouldn’t. I will only be banning you!” This time, I let go of my dad and turned to look at her. My eyelids didn’t even move as I delivered each line. “Alpha Marc! Are you going to allow her to speak to me this way?” An n looked over to Alpha Marc and noveldrama

Luna Erin for help. “Yes, we are. You see, since the moment we met this wonderful young lady, we had noticed how much abuse she has endured from your hands. You have been nothing but verbally and physically abusive and that will NOT be allowed to continue. She is not part of your pack anymore but ours. She is mine to protect and if she wishes to ban you, you are banned. I suggest you shut your mouth for once… with all due respect An n looked taken aback as she looked up at dad. “Go sit on the couch and let us finish this meeting.” Dad sighed. An n had tears in her eyes as she got up and moved over to the couch. She positioned herself away from us and there was little sniffles you could hear. Like she was trying to make us feel sorry for her. “Anyway, like I said, the rogues are awake and ready to be interrogated.” Alpha Marc looked at dad. “I will be there.” I said firmly. I felt all the eyes on me in an instant. “What? Why?” Dad asked, puzzled. “They were there to kidnap me, I want to be there when the information comes in. I have been trained

warrior and participated in it all. I’ve been in battle, I’ve killed before and obviously punching people is not uncommon for me. I deserve to be there.” “Okay, let’s go.” Alpha Marc shrugged and stood up. Luna Erin’s eyes were wide but she kept her mouth shut. An n, thankfully, didn’t say anything either. “Erin, please keep our….company occupied.” Alpha Marc whispered to his mate before giving her a quick k*ss on the cheek. “Will do.” Luna Erin frowned as she crossed her arms and took a seat. “After you.” Alpha Marc motioned for me to go first. Alec had the door opened for me to walk through Walking out of the packhouse, we made it about half way before my dad started talking again. “You sure about this, Kristen?” “Yes, dad. I want to know.” “You need to understand that not all interrogations are done with fist. All forms of torture are used to extract information.” That made me pause but I was determined to do this. “That’s fine, I’ll handle it.” “Okay but there is no shame in needing to leave or excuse yourself.” He was giving me a way out. “Dad…. I promise to leave if I become not okay. Okay?” I guess it didn’t matter how old I got, he would always worry about me. That seemed to satisfy dad because he didn’t comment back. What I did notice was the change in demeanor each guy possessed. Alec didn’t have any warmth to his green eyes. Instead, they were black and ready to taste blood. Once dad stopped talking, his too shifted as his reputation started to show. It almost made me flinch away from him. His chest puffed out, shoulders and arm grew like three inches and his aura pulsated around him. Alpha Marc seemed to grow as well. Everything about these men had magnified in just minutes. A guard was standing at the entrance with a AK-47. Only his hair blew in the wind, otherwise he was on high alert. Knees were bent, shoulders back with his finger hovering over the trigger.

 





###Chapter 136
Chapter 0136 As we walked up, he made eye contact with Alpha Marc and moved to the side. Knocking twice, the door opened as another guard held it for us. Every five feet, there was an armed guard standing at attention. Just waiting for an excuse to kill someone or something. Dirt, sweat and blood assaulted me the further we went in. Groaning was heard from each cell as we passed. Only once did the prisoner lunge forward and try to grab me. Alec pulled me back to him as the guard took his night stick and struck the cage. The sounds of his laughter died as we walked into the interrogation room. Cracked cement boxed us in with a single wire leading to a fluorescent light hanging down. A large mirror sat directly in fi in front of the three men tied down, n*ked to a metal chair. We were in the darkness but I’m sure they could still smell me. All three of their noses twitched when I walked in. “I thought there was more.” I said in a mind-link to Alec. “There was…” He didn’t need to elaborate to tell me they didn’t make it to this day. His arms Dad and Alpha Marc walked forward into the light. Alec stood beside me, without touching me. noveldrama

were folded as he was reining in his anger. “Let’s cut to the chance. Who sent you to attack my pack?” 1 saw something shin in the light. It wasn’t until he delivered an unusually hard punch that I realized it was brass knuckles. However, they had a cone point to each knuckle. I knew this tactic. You needed to figure out which one was going to c rack. There was always a strong one and a weaker one you could cr ack. Just needed to figure it out. Alpha Marc delivered a few punches to each one before he stepped back, waiting for an answer. The one in the middle discreetly pulled his left foot behind the right, as if trying to keep it safe. “We don’t know nothin!” He yelled.

“Shut up, Fred!” The one of the right tried to glare at him. “I’m not getting beaten up for that low life!” Fred started testing the restrains. “So, tell us what we need to know!” Dad roared. a We want t “I’ll make you a deal, you tell us what know and we will make your death painless.” Alpha Marc moved over to a table that I had not realized was there. Putting down his knuckles, he grabbed something long and white. A blue line crossed over between two metal points at the end. A cattle taser. “Let me counter offer, I will tell you everything but I want to tell it directly to her.” His eyes went right aver me to, like he knew exactly where I was. “That’s not happening.” Dad punched the guy straight in the nose. “It’s fine. “I said to dad in the mind-link. I didn’t want to undermine him and we still had to link due to t hadn’t denounced my ties yet. “Then we aren’t talking!” He said as he spit out blood at dad’s chest. Taking a few steps forward, I came into the light. My nerves started to rise but I pushed them down as hard as I could. They couldn’t know I was anxious or this wouldn’t go smoothly. “Get talking.” Their eyes all locked on me before moving down my b*dy. Alec let out a very angry threatening grow, making them laugh. “Oooh, big bad mate going to kill us?” The one the right laughed. “You wanted to talk to me, so talk.” Holding out my hands, I waited for them to get started. “I can see why he wants you.” The one on the left licked his l*ps. My skin crawled but I kept my composure. Alpha Marc zapped him with the taser, making him pee himself as his entire b*dy tensed and jerked in the chair. “Let’s start with you.” I said and walked in front of the middle one. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!!








###Chapter 137
Chapter 0137 “Do your best!” Nodding, I went over to the table to look at everything. There was a bat on the edge of the table. Grabbing it, I used it to touch his left leg. As hard as he tried to not flinch, he did. “As much as you can try to hid it, I know that is already injured. Tell me what I want or I will see to it that this leg is beaten flat before I cut it off.” His face went pale. “You don’t have it in you.” Calling his bluff, I walked over to the table and grabbed the rope. His eyes got wide as I went over to bend down. His right leg started swinging around, keeping me from tying it correctly. Thankfully, dad realized what I wanted and he held down the right leg as I tied the rope. Alec stepped forward, taking the rope and pulling it out straight. “Last chance.” I said as I measured the length I needed to be in order to ge a good swing. “You’re weak.” He looked nervously down at his leg before I pulled the bat behind my head and brought it down with as much force as possible. Aiming right for his shin, I heard the snap instantly. His screams echoed in the small room as the other two rogues cringed and looked away. However, I didn’t stop. After delivering two more blows, I took a step back. “You were saying?” Waiting for him to stop crying and thrashing, he glared at me through the tears in his eyes. “F u ck….yo u.” He was breathing heavily as I swung three more times before he started begging, “OKAY!’ noveldrama

talk!” “Wonderful.” I said as I set the bat down. I was breathing heavily myself. “Everything was done over the phone or internet. Nothing was handled in person. All we know.” “Shut up!” The one of the right started yelling. His face was full of anger. Alpha Marc grabbed a knife and sank it to the tilt in his thigh before twisting and pulling it out. Successfully nicking the artery, he out in minutes, if not seconds. “I’m going to bleed out!” He cried.

“That is the point.” I said looking at him like he was s tupid The guy in the middle watched as the blood ran down his leg and the chair, making a larg under him. Eventually, his eyes rolled back and he passed out e will bleed “We left our phones in a tree about a mile off of your territory! in an old Elm tree. There was a stream around it. Go look for it but it will have all the information on it!” The guy on the right was white as a ghost. “Yeah! I’ll even draw you a map!” Frank was nodding quickly as Alec put his leg back down “Why me?” I asked. My voice sounded almost venerable which I internally kicked myself for. “We don’t ask those questions. We are paid to do a job and we do it. If you weren’t literally right there, this might not have turned out the way it did. S tupid f uck didn’t pay attention before he scaled the wall. Now, we are all paying the price.” Frank shook his head. “Just kill me quickly. I told you all I knew.” Alec pulled me back into the shadows as Alpha Marc wrote down all the directions and information the had to give about the whereabouts of their phones. Dad stood behind them, waiting. Each man would occasionally look back, nervously as they talked. “Are y you holding up okay?” Alec mind-linked me. “Yeah, I’m fine.” This was starting to get to me, truthfully. When you are on the battle field, it’s killed or be killed. Here, it’s almost like cold blooded. Yes, they would have killed me or kidnapped me had we not stopped them but dad was literally waiting for them to stop talking so he could snap their necks.” Actually, I would like to go.” Alec didn’t respond, only quietly opened the door and allowed me to go first. It closed quietly behind us but my feet move quickly to get out of this place. Not one guard made eye contact with me as we left. It was only when the fresh air filled my nose, that I felt like I could breath.








###Chapter 138
Chapter 0138 “You didn’t have to join me.” I said as I leaned up against a tree. “No reason to stay down there.” Alec shrugged as he watched me. “I’m not going to break.” Looking up at the sky, birds were flying around, playing without a care in the world. “I know.” “So, what are you waiting for?” Looking back at him, he frowned. “Waiting for you to jump me.” “Now, who is using sarcasm to avoid the question?” “Figured I’d take a page out of your book.” Alec tried to smile. “If I can’t use sarcasm, you can’t either.” “Waiting for you to confess what we are both feeling from you.” “Nothing to confess. It just felt strange. Like, I know they need to die or it will only happen again but

seeing it, watching it…. just different.” “That’s why I didn’t want you to go.” 1 never said I couldn’t handle it and I think I did a good job down there!” That comment half way pis se d me off. “I think you did a great job, got them talking but that doesn’t mean it didn’t come as a price.” “No, I’m fine. Really. I did what I needed to. Once your dad gets back with the phones, they will need to get analyzed for the information. We need to head and check on the building progress anyway.” “Alright. Let’s go.” Right as I got off the tree, the door opened again and dad and Alpha Marc stepped out. “We were just headed to check on the building progress.” Alec said, instantly. “Sounds good. I am going to gather some warriors and go find this tree.” Alpha Marc held up a piece of paper.

“Let me know what you find.” Dad held out his hand to Alpha Marc. He took it and shook it firmly. “Of course. As soon as we know, I will reach out and we can decide on “Dad.” I said, hesitantly. “Yeah, kiddo?” “She isn’t banned but I don’t want her back here.” “Real soon…” Dad put his hands on my shoulders. It looked like he was struggling with the right words “Everything will….come together soon. Just know that I love you. You will be safe, if it’s the last thing! do.” He k*ssed my forehead before walking off. I was so confused. Warning bells went off as I looked at Alec. His eyes were looking at dad, as he were away. “Dad?” Alec asked Alpha Marc. “Not my place to say, son. Just get going to the building.” We all started following dad towards the packhouse. The walk was quiet. Only the birds kept the world around us from being completely quiet Our bikes were outside the packhouse, waiting for us. “I want to change. “I told Alec. He nodded and opened the front door for us to go inside. Angela’s goonies were whispering in the corner as we w in. As soon as they saw us, they glared and ran off. The fight was only yesterday so, it wasn’t like she was going to be hiding, waiting to stab me. Taking two stairs at a time, we were able to make it without any issues to our room. Trying to find where put my riding pants, that’s another problem. They weren’t in my dresser or on the shelves “Looking for these?” Alec held up a hanger with my pants on them. “Why are they hung up?” Grabbing them, I grabbed a black tank top and started getting dressed “I like m my bike clothes hung up. I bet the staff just followed what they knew I liked.” Alec shrugged as he put his boots on. “Hmm.” Finishing tucking in my tank, I got started on my boots. “That is probably my favorite outfit you have.” Alec was watching me zip up my boots and stand up. noveldrama

“Wait till you see my prom dress.” “I doubt it will beat this.” I felt the desire run through him as he hands landed on my hips. I had turned away from him so he was able to pull me back against him, feeling his hard di ck.






###Chapter 0139

"You like this better than me being naked?" I teased as I turned around. Alec slid a hand around the base of my neck, gently pulled my hair back. Involuntarily, making my eyes roll back into my head.

A deep growl vibrated his chest as his other hand landed on the small of my back, keeping me firmly against him. *Nothing is better than you naked but this look makes it hard to focus on the road." Alec leaned forward.

"Yeah, I can't even give you road head on a bike." I said as I felt his lips against mine.

"We can take the car." Alec muttered before he kissed me. It was a hungry kiss. Wrapping my arms around his biceps, we kissed for a few minutes before breaking away.

"If this goes any further, we will miss our ride."

*So?"

*Then we won't have any fun in the woods out there." I whispered in his ear as he was gently kissing my neck.

Alec grabbed ahold of my ass and squeezed painfully hard before letting go. "Fine, but get your ass moving or won't be able to control myself."

"How did you control yourself last time?" I laughed as I dashed out the door.

*The fact that you wouldn't have allowed me to do what I wanted to you. Now, I can have all the control and do whatever I want. You are putty in my hands. There are a few points on your body that after one kiss, you are a goner."

We were walked down the stairs at this point but that statement caught me off guard. "I do?" "Yes, you do." Alec smacked my ass as he passed me since I had stopped walking. "Where?" He was holding the door open for me, waiting. Walking quickly to my bike, we got on. "I'll show you when we get there." Alec promised before putting on his helmet, jacket and gloves. "Good luck. I might just be immune to it now." I challenged before I put my own helmet on.noveldrama

Alec's eyes narrowed at me but I smirked back. "You are going to regret saying that." Alec said in the mind-link. Started our bikes, we peeled out into the open road.

"I guess we will see who is better." A wave of pleasure shot through me as I starting thinking about all the ways I was going to get him back for this.

"Okay, what the fuck are you thinking about?" Alec finally asked. It had been twenty minutes of me thinking of sexual things. I knew he could feel it from me.

*Just how you like your dick stroked with my tongue or the way you like when I'm on to-" I started.

Alec interrupted me. "Enough! Or I will take you right here. In the middle of the highway." It wasn't just a threat but a promise.

Laughing, "Looks like I might win this." Getting on the throttle, I blew past Alec as we had just hit an open part of the highway. I was free! The wind on my face, the feel of the gravel under my tires and the power being my legs.

There was a wave of both pleasure and happiness from Alec that warmed my soul. I had really found my better half. However, I'd never tell him that.

*Slow down or you will miss the turn off." Alec finally spoke to me.

*I want to take a cross country trip on our bikes. Like ride them to where ever we go on vacation!" I said without thinking.

*So... you are taking mom and dad's offer?" Alec asked, surprised.







###Chapter 140

"I didn't say that." I said out loud as I took my helmet off. The sounds of drills, saws and the smell of sawdust filled the air. In the distance, we could see the top of the building.

"Oh?" We started walking up the hill.

*Just whenever we take a trip, we can take our bikes. I honestly hadn't thought about what your mom said too much."

"Okay."

"What do you think we should do?"

"That is completely up to you." Alec wasn't giving me an inch.

*This is something we should decide together."

"No, it's not. Since I met you, you do things your way. If I was to say, we are doing this, you would instantly pull back from it. No, I know you. You need to do things your way, on your time. Which is why I was upset when mom even said anything."

We walked up to the metal fence that was around their building sight. Alec walked right pasted the signs and to the trailer that had a generator running. Knocking once, he walked right in.

"Who in the fur... Mr. Alec. I wasn't aware you were stopping by today." A beefy guy walked our from behind a desk to shake Alec's hand.

"Mr. Henrick, this is my wife, Kristen."

I was slightly taken aback but Mr. Henrick's was a human and didn't know about wolves. A wife was equal to a mate. "Hello." I held out my hand and he shook it too but slightly annoyed.

"I wasn't aware you were married." He looked directly at Alec. His belly hung over his jeans. Somehow, the suspenders managed to keep them up but just barely.

*You never asked. I came to check on the process. Where are we with things and I would like a walk through, please."

"Certainly." Mr. Henrick grabbed his baseball cap and walked outside. Following him, I just stayed a step behind and observed. "We have all the framing done."

There was blueprints off to the side. So, as Alec and Mr. Henrick discussed the joints, I slipped over to them. The event center was massive. According to the blueprints, there was going to be a football size center with the possibility of separating into two different spaces if needed. Each side was mirrored as far as bathrooms, open spaces and general layout. It wasn't until I looked at the attic and roof structure that something wasn't adding up. "Alec?" I called, as I looked at them.

The men stopped talking instantly to look back at me. "Yeah?"noveldrama

"I think we have a problem." Turning back to the blueprints, I pulled out the roof design.

"What's the problem?"

*The angles, they won't be able to hold the weight of the space."

*Impossible! We ran those numbers multiple times!" Mr. Henrick was instantly defensive.

*I have no doubt you did. All I am saying is the ratio of space between each arch, plus the type of connecting joints you are using. This thin on wood will not be able to handle any type of pressure. Like snow or a full house. can almost guarantee you will see a failure here and here." I pointed to two separate spots that were most concerning to me. "Possibly more."

*They are holding up fine!" Mr. Henricks gestured to the build.

"Well yeah, there is no sheetrock or thousands of people in it." The annoyance was starting to show. "You need to place additional support beams in those locations to keep things secured."

"Wh-" Mr. Henrick started. His eyes were narrowed at me.

"I think that is a great idea. See that it is done, Mr. Henrick. Also, we will be coming up more frequently to check on things." Alec grabbed my hand as we continued on our tour.

They hadn't started on electrical or plumbing yet so there wasn't much to see. Each room looked appropriate to the blueprints and seemed to be put together correctly. Not a single gap between each joint.

It took us about an hour to walk the whole thing and observe it all. Mr. Henrick was quite pissy with me but I just ignored him. Alec took care of most of the talking. As we were leaving, Alec grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the forest.







###Chapter 141

“What are we doing here?” I asked.

“I have a surprise for you.” Alec shrugged as we followed the same path as last time we were here.

“I’ll never get tired of this view.” Stopping for a second, there was a break in the trees, allowing me to look down at the city.

“You won’t have to.” Alec was ahead of me, waiting for me to keep walking.

“What do you mean?” I asked as I started up to him.

“Come see.” Alec walked another hundred feet before stepping off to the side. There, in the middle of the forest was a gigantic treehouse cabin. Framed and waiting for electricity and plumbing, it was being built alongside the convention center.

“What is this?” I said, breathlessly. Completely shocked, my hand barely touched the wooden handrail that would soon become the walkway to the front door.

“You said you loved this place and I know it isn’t the beach but this will be our own private getaway. Just ours. Our home away from home if you will.” Alec didn’t move, he waited and watched me.

“You did this? For me?” Still trying to wrap my head around it, I glanced over at him.

“For us, but yes. Come see.” Alec walked down the path and into the treehouse. The flooring was in place for the most part so it was easy to not trip as we went higher and higher. “This is the living room. Over there is the master bedroom. Two bedrooms over there and there will be two bathrooms. The kitchen is right here.” Alec walked into the living room to the other side and opened his arms wide. It was an open layout.

“Two bedrooms?” I asked.

“For our kids or if you want to invite Emmy and Jasper out here.” Alec grabbed a blanket that I hadn’t even realized was here. Going out to what will be the front porch, he laid it down. Following his lead, I sat down beside him.

“This view...” It was perfect. Clear view to the sky and down to the city below. The tops of the trees followed the slope of the hillside, making it seem like waves.

“I agree, beautiful.” Alec was looking directly at me when he spoke. As my eyes met his, I got choked up. Tears of happiness threatened to fall. I doubt Alec was ready for me but as I threw my arm around his, he fell back on the ground.noveldrama

“I can’t thank you enough.” I muttered in his neck. Embarrassed the tears fell.

Alec’s chest rumbled with his laughter as he rolled me on my back. Keeping his arm under my head, his other hand cupped my face. Using his thumb, wiping the tear away. “I love you.”

Leaning forward, I kissed him hard. Not exactly sexual but this meant so much to me. Only after a few minutes, did I pull back. Putting my hand on his cheek, my thumb traced his lips. “I love you too.” I said in a whisper.

Alec didn’t respond but leaned down and kissed me again. His hand moved to my waist, pulling my tank out of my pants. Snaking his way up to my breast. “I’ll never get enough of you.” Alec said between kisses as he moved down my neck. Grabbing my tank, I pulled it off. Giving him better access.

“Your hands...” I said as he moved on top of me.

“See, I know all your points. Like here..” Alec moved to my left breast and sucked hard under my boob. My back instantly arched as a wave of pleasure ran through me.

“Oh!” I moaned as my eyes rolled back.

“And here...” Alec moved lower on my stomach. More towards my back, he sucked again.

My body started vibrating with need and he was going too damn slow. I tried to sit up but he pushed me down as he messed with my pants. “But...”

“No, this is my fun.” Alec didn’t even make eye contact with me as he removed my boots and pulled my pants down, keeping my underwear in place.








###﻿Chapter 0142

"I need you." My panties were soaked, making a cloud of arousal filled the air and shoot into Alec's nose as he took a deep breath. His eyes went black as he stared at me.

*So fucking sexy." He said more to himself as he lowered his head to me. His fingers teased me as he barely gazed over my folds. "Here is a spot." His tongue licked my inner thigh, making my legs spread wider for him.

"Holy fuck." I groaned.

"Can I get you to cum without even actually touching you?" Alec came back up to my face that was flushed with need.

"I'm about to pin you down if you don't shove your dick in me." I threatened.

"Interesting." Alec gave me a half smile before moving to my right side and finding another spot. My legs started shaking as I wrapped them around him, trying to force his dick against me. The problem was, he still had all his clothes on.

Right as I was about to grab his shirt, he moved to my hip and nibbled, sending waves of pleasure to the point I felt the pressure build. "Alec, please! Touch me." I whined as I lowered my own hand to me.

"No." Alec growled as he grabbed my hands and held them still. With one hand, he undid his belt and ripped it out. It happened so quickly that I didn't even see how he did it but it was fucking sexy as hell. Another wave of juices slid out of me.

Using his teeth, he made a loop and put my hands in it. Securing it to the wood above my head, I was powerless to him now. "Oh fuck." I moaned as I watched him slip back down to my stomach. Right over where my right ovary should be, he nibbled again. This time, I yelled out. "ALEC! I'm so wet!"

"I know. Cum for me." Alec said as his breath blew into my panties before nibbling another spot so hard that my orgasm hit. My hips buckled and only then did Alec move my panties to the side and start licking my clit.

*Holy fuck." I groaned as Alec kept the attack up. My eyes were closed as he removed my panties and inserted two fingers into me.

"Look at me." Alec had moved on top of me. Opening my eyes, his were drilling into me with so much passion that I was left breathless.

"Harder... please!" I whispered. Relaying my need in my eyes. He listened this time as he rammed his dick into me. I wasn't sure when his pants came off but I didn't care. All I knew was he was pounding me like never before. Sweat formed as he grabbed the wood and used it as an anchor.

However, it still wasn't enough. There was just enough slack on the belt that I was able to wrapped my legs around him, halting his thrust before using every ounce of strength I had to flip him over. The movement was so quick and caught him off guard that he went over easily. His dick never he left me as I used the belt to help me ride him.

"Oh fuck!" Alec groaned as his claws dug into my hips. With a combination of bouncing and thrusting my own hips, the pressure was building. I used every ounce of strength I had in me and put them in each thrust. Riding him like I had never before, pulling every inch of pleasure out of him.noveldrama

*ALEC!" I yelled before my orgasm hit. Alec's hit at the same time as his hips thrusted upward. Collapsing against my arms, I could see him with one eye. His jaw was clenched shut as his body was tensed up. It took a solid minute for him to relax and open his eyes.






###Chapter 143
My eyes looked up at Penny, who was avoiding eye contact with me. Colt was standing beside her but not touching her. “Penny?”

She looked up at me with tears in her eyes. “I swear I don’t know anything! You know I was an orphan! You literally found me in the woods!” She was begging me to listen. “I don’t even know who my family are!” noveldrama

The DNA was a percentage of a parent. That means, her dad loaded the gun that shot you.” Alpha Marc clarified for me even more. “How did you find her?”

“She was in the orphan when I volunteered there. She was a teenager… almost 15 and was getting into trouble. Sneaking out, stealing.

“I was stealing books! It wasn’t like I was a druggy!” Penny defended herself.

“The books she took were advanced books. No one payed attention to what books she took but that she

took them. I noticed what they were so I took responsibility for her. Making her do tasks for me. Once she

earned some trust and showed me what she was capable of doing, I started paying her. Not much but

enough she was able to buy clothes and food. Eventually, Dad got her into a young adult housing situation

and out of the orphanage.” It was like I was on autopilot.

“I don’t remember any of my family. I swear! I only remember the orphanage!” Penny had tears in her

eyes.

“We found her on the edge of our property as a baby. No one claimed her and we put h DNA in the system in case there was any hits. There wasn’t, until now.” Dad was looking at the paper like it was an

alien.

“Colt, is she lying?” Alpha Marc asked.

“No. She is telling the truth. You can command her if you wish.” Colt looked up at the ceiling in pain. This must be incredibly hard for him. His loyalty to his sister against his mate.

“C-colt?” Penny looked betrayed at her but Alpha Marc didn’t need to be told twice. We watched as his aura lashed out and covered Penny. She instantly fell to the ground in submission.

“Have you told us a lie?” He commanded.

“NO!”

“Are you leaving anything out?”

“No! I love Kristen and would never b e tray the only sister I have ever known!”

“Hey Alec?” I asked trying to sound se xy in the mind-link.

“What?”

“Do you know why I love to ride my bike so much?”

“Why’s that?”

Looking over at him, “Before all the power I feel between my legs.” His eyes narrowed at me as I put the throttle to the floor and took off.

~

“You won’t be able to walk to school tomorrow.” Alec promised as he caught up to me. I didn’t even respond but I smiled at him. As we moved down the hill, the curves twisted tightly. Since I was feeling so good, I cruised down them effortlessly. My bike and I were one as we rotated side to side. My knees

barely above the pavement. We made our way home. It was a great afternoon.

Pulling into the packhouse, the atmosphere was very tense and uninviting. Alec and I looked at each

other as we took our helmets off and made our way to Alpha Marc’s office. Alec knocked once before

going in. I was a little taken aback by the amount of people here. Dad, Colt, Penny, Jacob, Jasper, Emmy

and Luna Erin were all silent. Just staring at the wall.

“Where is Sherry?” I asked Jacob.

“In the kitchen.” He said in a sullen tone.

“What’s going on?” Alec pulled me towards him as if someone was going to jump out and stab me

“This.” Alpha Marc threw a piece of paper at Alec. It fell to the floor, making Alec bend down and grab it

he lowered it so we both could read it.

“I don’t understand what I’m reading.

“It is saying the bullet came from a 9mm Smith and Weston, which we knew. However, the gun is tied to a series of murders that has happened across the U.S. However, this is what is concerning” Alec pointed to

some fine print at the bottom.

“Does that say… no…” I must not have read that right.

“It said that there was additional DNA on the bullet that is a familial DNA match to a Penelope Atwater.”

Alec’s b*dy vibrated in anger.







###Chapter 144
Chapter 0144 My eyes looked up at Penny, who was avoiding eye contact with me. Colt was standing beside her but not touching her. “Penny?” She looked up at me with tears in her eyes. “I swear I don’t know anything! You know I was an orphan! You literally found me in the woods!” She was begging me to listen. “I don’t even know who my family are!” “The DNA was a percentage of a parent.

This must be incredibly hard for him. His loyalty to his sister against his mate. “C-colt?” Penny looked betrayed at her but Alpha Marc didn’t need to be told twice. We watched as his aura lashed out and covered Penny. She instantly fell to the ground in submission. “Have you told us a lie?” He commanded. “NO!” “Are you leaving anything out?” “No! I love Kristen and would never betray the only sister I have ever known!” Alpha Marc looked around at us. Everyone shook their heads before he pulled back his aura. Penny slapped Colt’s hand away as he tried to help her up. Holding herself, she tried to make herself as small possible. I wanted to go to her so bad but something was stopping me. “I thought they were rogues that shot me?” “They were but we haven’t traced them back to who wanted to take you. We assume it was the same from the rogue attack here.” “So we haven’t found Ace’s killer yet.” I added in there. “Did you find the phone?” “We did, it is still being analysed. Looking for the IP address. It was all encrypted.” Dad said with a a sigh. “So we have nothing and now Penny’s DNA caused a hit. It will now be flagged for everyone to see and for her family to know where she is.” I clarified. “To be fair, they left her outside the gates, they have always known where she was.” Jacob chimed in. “All we know is that the gun that was used to shoot you was loaded by Penny’s dad.” Alpha Marc stated. “At least it wasn’t the gun that killed Ace.” I said to Alec in the mind-link. Glancing up at him, he barely looked down at me but didn’t respond. “But we don’t know if they rogue that was firing the gun was her dad?” I asked. “No.” Dad said. “So, we could have killed him. Where is the b*dy?”

“You know we burn them. There is no way of knowing if the rogue was her dad or if he just loaded the gun.” Dad looked at me and frowned. In I knew that but I was hoping I was wrong. I felt so bad for Penny. Slowly, I made my way to Penny and sat I I down in front of her. “Please believe me. I didn’t know. I would never betray you.” She whispered through her tears.







###Chapter 145
Chapter 0145 “I believe you, Penny. You need to understand what this means though and you can’t be upset with Colt. This needed to happen so we could clear your name.” She looked up at Colt and then back at me. “I know, I just feel guilty and ashamed.” “Things will probably get harder as this goes on but trust in Colt to lead you the right way.” Placing my hand on her knee, I watched tears fall silently down her cheeks. Standing up, I moved back to stand directly in front of Alec. Pushing my back against his so I had that contact. His hand rested on my shoulders. “It’s safe to say that we will be looking into her family. This said Atwater so that is where we will start.” Alpha Marc sighed as he sat down. “Agreed. Let us know when you do.” Dad signaled for his party to leave. Penny stood up and sl*pped her hand in Colt’s as they walked out. Colt nodded to me but he was having a hard time right now. Guilt and confusion covered his face and nothing I could say would fix it. Only time would tell. “What is the plan for this week?” Alpha Marc asked us.

“Kristen?” Alec looked down at me. I “I guess I need to go to school to get my stuff then we can come home. It will be safer this way and we can take all of our exams here.” I sighed as I hated being forced to do this. If I wanted to take my exams this way, I would have ski pped school all together. “That is a smart decision.” Alpha Marc sat down. He dismissed us that way, which just annoyed me but it wasn’t a hill I was ready to die on. Walking out, Jasper caught up with us. “What are you guys supper plans?” “I don’t think we have any…” I looked up at Alec for confirmation. “Nope, why? Have something in mind?”

“Movie night?” “We can do that.” Alec looked at me and I nodded. “Why don’t you get something from the kitchen and meet us in our room?” I asked Jasper. “Sure. Emmy will be happy.” “Good.” I nodded as Jasper turned and walked away. Following Alec, we made our way to our room. “Did you ever decide if you wanted to make any changes to our room?” Alec asked me as he sl*ppes off his shirt. “I mean…like what?” Looking around, all my possessions sat on my night stand. Alec nad the picture of us from my birthday framed and put above our bed but otherwise, it was exactly as I found t “Different colors? New bedding? Paint?” Alec tossed out a few ideas at me. “You chose sage green for your shop. A full 180 from what I have this at.” “Well, that was the vibe I wanted in my shop. Not for my bedroom.” “Your bedroom was very bare at your old pack.” Alec said as I went into the closet and pulled out a my favorite silk pajama sets. I started changing in the closet. “I knew I wasn’t going to be living there so I didn’t care to change anything.” I yelled out. “Well, now you can. What do you want to do differently?” Alec walked into the closet and leaned against the door frame. “I like black and red.” I shrugged. I “Come on, there isn’t anything you want to do differently?” Alec pushed, thinking I was holding out. Walking out into the bedroom, I started looking around. “I’m serious, Alec. I love the silk sheets. If you haven’t noticed, I like my silk pajamas. We could upgrade the couch and chairs. They are pretty worn and I like the deeper couches. I’m not a huge fan of white and the red really balances out everything. We could put a few more pictures on the walls…” noveldrama

###Chapter 146
Chapter 0146 “I’m glad you said that.” Alec snapped his fingers and went into the closet. Coming back out, he had two massive pictures. Turning them around, they were my drawings from forever ago. One of was wolf’s head and the other was of a Bald Eagle. “These were huge favorite’s of mine from your sketch pad. I put them in a frame and would love to hang these.” My My voice was caught in my throat. He picked out the perfect frame for them. A light grey wooden distressed frame. It was thicker and made of actual wood so it brought out each pensil stroke. Walking over, I took the wolf’s head and examined it. It had taken me weeks to do this one. It was right in the middle of summer and I didn’t stay in the packhouse much. Looking around, “What about above the dressers?” There was an empty stop that seemed to be perfect for these. “Sounds good.” Alec set them down and walked to the kitchenette and returned with a hammer and nails. He had this planned good. After helping him get them level, we stepped back and looked at it. “It really does fit perfectly there.” I said as I sl*pped my hand around his arm.” “I agree. Those are beautiful pieces.” There was a knock at the door. Alec went to answer it as I sat down noveldrama

on the couch. Now that he mentioned it, maybe upgrading his furniture would be a good idea. It wasn’t uncomfortable but I didn’t sink into it like I would have liked to for a movie night. “Dinner is served.” Emmy’s voice sang as she walked in. “Aw, you got them hung!” Jasper noticed right away as he followed Emmy in. His eyes went straight to my artwork on the wall. Setting the food down, Emmy looked up and smiled. “Ah, the wolf’s head.” “Why do you say it like that?” Jasper asked as he started opening the food.

“That was a bitc h to get right apparently. She was pi ssy for like a month because it wasn’t turning out the way she wanted. Something about the eyes.” Shaking her head, she handed me my food. “Hey! If the eyes are good, the whole piece is the s hits.” Alec sat beside me. Jasper handed him his food before taking a seat on the arm chair. “What movie did you guys pick out?” “We haven’t yet. Been putting a picture up.” I said before I took a bite of my Italian sub. “I’m in the mood for a scary movie!” Emmy scrunched up her face as she looked at me. +15 BONUS “Did you ever decide if you wanted to make any changes to our room?” Alec asked me as he sl*pped off his shirt. “I mean….like what?” Looking around, all my possessions sat on my night stand.

###Chapter 147
Chapter 0147 “That’s okay. I have ways to convince you.” Jasper teased as he went to put in the movie. “What’s wrong?” I asked Alec in the mind-link. He didn’t answer but handed me his phone. Taking it, I saw an email. Alec, I am requesting a meeting with you tomorrow afternoon to discuss my advancement in this pack. There are multiple positions open that I would like to apply for and would like your guidance on. If 3pm would work for you, please let me know. With all my love, Angela “What did you reply?” I asked. Alec took his phone back and messed with it before handing it back to me Angela, 3pm is fine. Luna Kristen and I will be there.

Alpha Alec “Why don’t you have your own office?” “Never really needed one.” Alec shrugged as he laid down behind me. The movie was starting and Jasper turned off the lights. “I think we should have our own. I need one to do my shop’s money and with all the new stuff I will be taking on, it will be good for me to have space to organize it.” “Okay, I will look into it.” Alec wrapped his arm around me and pulled me tightly against him. The movie started out slow, like every horror movie. Losing interest, I turned around and rested my in Alec’s chest. Closing my eyes, I drifted off to sleep as Alec rubbed my back. head noveldrama

“Come on, wake up!” My b*dy was shaking but I refused to acknowledge it. I know you are awake and can hear me.” Alec laughed. “I don’t want to be awake. How did I even get to get?” “I carried you. You weren’t waking up. Dead to the world.” The bed dipped as I felt Alec stand up. “Why am I awake?” I asked, annoyed. +15 BONUS “We need to go to school.” “I change my mind, let me sleep.” Grabbing the blankets, I pulled them over my head. I had just got comfortable when they were violently ripped from my hands. Cold air attacked my b*dy as I sat up quickly. “WHAT THE HELL?” “Get up, sleepy head.” Alec laughed at my expression but turned around and walked into the closet. Grumpily, I had no choice but to get up and shower. However, I was feeling rather petty so I locked the bathroom door. To my delight, I heard the door rattle so I knew Alec noticed it was locked. The hot water felt nice and did help me wake up. Stepping out and drying off, I started doing my makeup and hair “How much longer do you need?” Alec yelled from outside the door. Turning on the blow dryer, pretended I didn’t hear him. Eventually, he walked off and I was able to finish straightening my hair. Going to the closet, Alec still wasn’t here so I was able to get dressed in a romper and was buckling my sandals when he walked in. “Hi.” I said with a small smile. “Talking to me again?” Alec laid a bagel down with cream cheese in front of me. “What do you mean?” Playing dumb, I picked it up and took a bite. “Thank you.” “Yeah, okay. We need to get going.” Alec looked at his watch. “Where is your mom? I need a tote bag or get all of mine and Emmy’s stuff.” After a second, Alec answered. “She is in dad’s office. We can meet her at the front doors and she w bring you some.” “Perfect!” Jumping up, I grabbed my purse and phone before we left. After locking the door, we walked to the foyer but his mother wasn’t here yet. Alec kept checking his

watch like we were going to be late. “Where is she?” He muttered. “What is wrong? We aren’t going to a class. Just getting our stuff and coming home.” “Colt is meeting us there at 8:30 and I hate being late to stuff.” Alec sighed as his mother came aroun the corner. BONUS








###Chapter 148
Chapter 0148 “Here! I found these two. I hope they work!” Luna Erin walked up to me and smiled. “Perfect! These will be great. Our stuff just wouldn’t fit into my backpack alone. I really appreciate this.” “Anytime dear. I do need to run though.” “So, do we.” Alec opened the door and basically scooted me out. “Bye!” I waved at his mom as he nodded and almost slammed the door shut. Our car was already out front and waiting for us. As we drove, Alec’s posture became more and more rigid. His knuckles were white on the steering wheel and he had a look in his eyes at would make people run from him. I, however, found it se xy as hell. Still, I didn’t ask him why he was so moody. This was more than just being late, which we weren’t. Alec pulled up to the school right at 8:30. Colt was standing by the doors. “Hey, Ice.” Colt came up to me as we got out and gave me a hug. “How are you?” I asked. noveldrama

I “Been better.” Colt sighed. He put his arm around my shoulders as we walked in. “Where is Penny?” I asked, quietly. “Home. I needed to run to the bank and handle a few things.” That confused me. “That is dad’s job..” We came up to my locker. Unlocking it, I started putting my stuff in it. “It’s mine now.” Colt shrugged as him and Alec kept looking around, like they were waiting for something. “Why would dad have you do that?” I started pounding it. “Don’t worry about it.” Colt said aloof. My locker was finally cleaned out, and I was shutting it when it hit me. “You are taking over the Alpha role,

aren’t you?” Colt slowly looked back at me. There was a look in his eyes that reflected the pain he was in. “Getting there.” “That means….” I had this sinking feeling that I wasn’t going to like It. Dad’s words echoed in my head as pieced together everything. “He’s going to ditch An n isn’t he?” Colt clenched his jaw together as he looked at me. Alec kept looking around but glanced at me occasionally. “This isn’t the place for that conversation.” “Alec’s right. Lets get your stuff and get out of here.” Colt grabbed my bag and picked it up. “We need to stop at Emmy’s locker.” I said sullenly. We walked in quiet until we got there. I’ve known her code for years. It was easy to open her locker and clean it out. However, pushed into the corner of the door was a picture. It was of all of us from about three years ago. Colt and I were in the middle. Emmy was on Colt’s other side with Ace standing next to me and Jacob next to him. We were all smiling. It was a pond day so we were in our bathing suits. We were carefree and having fun. My eyes went to the bruise on my hip that was black and blue. A nn had pushed me down the stairs the day before so it was still fresh and didn’t have time to heal. “What’s that?” Colt asked. “That day at the pond.” I said as I held it out to him. A sad smile spread across his face as he looked at it. Alec leaned over and glanced at it before returning to his lookout post. “That was a fun day.” Colt handed me back the picture. “It was.” Shutting Emmy’s locker, we made our way to the office. “I ran into Ace’s dad this morning.” Colt said hesitantly.. “Oh?” Not sure I wanted to hear it.

###Chapter 149
Chapter 0149 “They are burying the tree today.” My heart hurt that I couldn’t be there but I understood. “Where at?” “He wanted it out on top of the hill that overlooks our territory. “That would be a perfect place for it.” “He told me to tell you that he forgives you. I assume he will be calling soon.” Colt gave me a half smile as I immediately stopped waWe were in front of the office. “What?” Tears threatened to expose themselves but I pushed them down. “Well, isn’t this nice.” A voice I hoped I’d never hear pulled me away from Colt. The office door had opened and Darin stepped out. “Darin.” Colt said, firmly. “I was hoping to run into you today.” He was looking at me. Alec moved closer to me, blocking Darin from

advancing. “We were just leaving.” I said. “What’s the rush?” I “You need to get to class and I have a very busy schedule today. If you would excuse us.” I said as I walked around Colt and into the office. No one followed me in here so I was able to breath a little. “Ms. Kristen. How can I help you today?” The secretary smiled warmly at me. She was an older lady with grey hair and glasses that landed on the tip of her nose. “We are needing to do our exams remotely. I was just wanting to inform you all so they can get sent over to us via email and we will take them tomorrow.” “That can be arranged. Who is all needing it?” She pulled out a piece of paper. “Alec, Emmy, Jasper and myself. I’m not sure what my brother is doing. I believe he is doing the same as is Penny and Jacob.”

“Okay, I’ll send them all. Anything else?” “I believe that is it. I’ve cleaned out our lockers and we will still walk as of right now. I’ve turned in ali my extra work so that is done.” “Actually, they might want a teacher to come and watch everyone take the test.” The secretary looked concerned as she glanced over at the principles door. “If that is the case, that is fine. Just let me know and I will organize a time that works for everyone.” That really wasn’t a big deal. “Thank you for understanding.” She was clearly relieved. “Of course. Have a great day.” I said as I walked out of the office and back to the three guys. “Are you done?” Alec asked without taking his eyes off Darin. “I am, can we leave now?” I asked. “Yes, let’s go.” Colt answered and took my arm a little more forcefully than needed. “I’ll be in touch.” Darin smiled at me before turning and walking down the hall as the guys flanked me Alec was pis sed and I could tell Colt was just has mad. They walked with a purpose that forced me to practically run to keep up. As we got to our cars, they started to relax. “Colt, we need to talk.” I said giving him a look. “I know, I have a few things I need to do and then I can swing by?” He looked at Alec for confirmation. “We have a meeting at 3pm. Otherwise, we are flexible.” Alec was trying to relax himself. “Okay, I’ll call when I am ready. It might be later this afternoon or evening but I’ll swing by to talk.” Colt looked me in the eyes and made me a silent promise. “Okay.” Colt k*ssed my forehead before shaking Alec’s hand and walking to his car. Alec held the door open for me and we got in. Right as Alec pulled out, I saw Darin, looking at me through a window. It gave me the chills but thankfully Alec quickly got out of there. Needing ng some comfort, I put my hand on Alec’s thigh. The physical contact was enough to help me calm, my nerves. To my surprise, Alec let go of the steering wheel and wrapped his hand around mine. Moving our hands over to my lap, he placed his hand between my thighs.noveldrama







###Chapter 150
Chapter 0150 “Are you okay?” I asked him. Wrapping my other hand around his arm, I felt like I was holding on for my life. “I should be asking you that.” Alec muttered. “If dad does let Colt take over and he ditches An n, he may not survive.” “I know.” Alec said softly. “What happened while I was in the office?” “Nothing really. He poked the bear and Colt and I didn’t react so he kept poking hoping it would cause a fight.” Alec was still fuming. “Need me to make things better?” I asked leaning over to him. Alec glanced at me and tried not to smile. “We will be home before you will finish, plus, I doubt you want me to drive through the gates with your head in my lap.” “Ew, no. Sitting back down, I looked out the window. “I rather not be outside of our territory any more than needed. However, when we get home, that is a

different story.” Alec’s finger played with the hem of my shorts. “Sorry, t that offer has expired.” Smiling at him, he rolled his eyes. We pulled up to the gate and Alec stopped the car, rolling down the window, he started talking to the guards. Mainly about the patrol and my mind went to Penny. I felt so bad for her. It wasn’t her fault who she was born into. Still, I had a bad feeling that it wasn’t her dad was that killed. No, he was still out there. However, I wondered if he even knew about her… or cared. The car started rolling again, bringing me out of my thoughts. “What are we doing today?” I asked. “I have something to show you and then I need to get some work done.” “What is Jasper doing?” “I think he is helping Emmy do a few things around the pack.” “Like what?” We were pulling up to the front dours. noveldrama

“Basically doing her Beta Female duties.” We got out of the car and headed inside. “Oh…” “Why?” I went to walk up the stairs but Alec pulled me down the hallway. “Just curious.“ +15 BONUS “Do you want to join them?” Alec opened a door. It was an unused conference center. However, it was more storage than anything now. “No, I want to work on some sketches today. I’ll just sit with you and drawl while you work.” “What do you think of this?” Alec asked. The storage room? A bit dusty…” “For our own office.” That surprised me as I started looking around. “Oh good! You are back! What do you think? Will this room work?” Luna Erin scared the cr ap out of me as she snuck up behind us. “S hit!” Jumping. I moved to the side as she walked in. Laughing, she placed her hand on my forearm. I internally jerked as I wasn’t one for personal contact but she seemed to not have noticed. Alec did, however. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.” “It’s okay. I think this will be a great space. “There is one more option I am spare.” Luna Erin motioned us to follow her. “There is?” Alec asked. “Yeah, I started looking at all the rooms and we have a few rooms that almost never get used. We can renovate one of them to meet your needs.” She walked up to the second floor. It was the first door right off the stairs. Opening it, it was a guest bedroom. “This is a bedroom?” I looked at her confused. I “I know but since it is right off the stairs, we don’t use it often. I think the last time it was used was like three years ago. Anyway, it already has a bathroom in here. So you guys won’t have to leave to use one There will be plenty of room for two desk and a small seating area off to the side. Maybe put a

###Chapter 151
Chapter 0151 “I actually like this room better.” I said. Having a private bathroom will be beneficial.” “Wonderful!” Luna Erin clapped her hands together. “I actually have a team that just finished a house and are ready for their next project. We can have them work on this today. The only thing needed is flooring and paint. If you can decide what you want today, I’ll make sure it is ordered. As well as what kind of desk you guys want.” “I was going to be working out of dad’s office today as he has different things going on.” Alec filled in his mother. “That works out really good. I’ll give you my laptop and you can chose what you want and buy it.” Luna Erin looked at her watch. “Sounds good.” Alec said for me as he walked out of the bedroom. She took off to the office as we followed her. Alec moved to his dad’s chair as Luna Erin positioned her laptop on the coffee table. “This is the company we buy through, put whatever you want in the cart and buy it.” She stood up and moved to the door.

“What budget do you want to use on this?” I asked, slightly nervous. Luna Erin stopped, looked at me and smiled. “Just buy whatever you you want. I want you to feel comfortable here. This is your space to design and create however you want. Do what makes you happy. This is your home.” The look in her eyes caught me off guard. I had never had a woman look at me with so much compassion and love before. I felt my mouth open as she walked out of the room. I just stared at the door for a second before looking at the computer. “Still not used to it?” Alec asked, bring me out of my thoughts. noveldrama

“Oh, um…” I glanced at him but didn’t really want to answer that. I had maybe one actual conversation with his mother. It wasn’t like there had been multiple times she has acted as a mother figure to me. Last time we talked, it didn’t go over well. Grabbing the computer, I put it on my lap and started looking. Having never thought about what design I wanted for my office, I went to g****e and searched professional office designs before hitting image. There were so many styles that it was hard to chose. “What do you want it to look like?” I asked Alec. “I honestly don’t care.” Alec shrugged. Giving him a glare, I went back to the pictures. “Just no bright colors.” +15 BONUS “Why?” I went to walk up the stairs but Alec pulled me down the hallway. “Just curious.” “Do you want to join them?” Alec opened a door. It was an unused conference center. However, it was more storage than anything now. “No, I want to work on some sketches today. I’ll just sit with you and drawl while you work.” “What do you think of this?” Alec asked. “The storage room? A bit dusty…” “For our own office.” That surprised me as I started looking around. “Oh good! You are back! What do you think? Will this room work?” Luna Erin scared the c rap out of me as she snuck up behind us. “S hit!” Jumping, I moved to the side as she walked in. Laughing, she placed her hand on my forearm. I internally jerked as I wasn’t one for personal contact but she seemed to not have noticed. Alec did, however. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.” “It’s okay. I think this will be a great space.” “There is one more option I am spare.” Luna Erin motioned us to follow her. 1

“There is?” Alec asked. “Yeah, I started looking at all the rooms and we have a few rooms that almost never get used. We can renovate one of them to meet your needs.” She walked up to the second floor. It was the first door right off the stairs. Opening it, it was a guest bedroom. “This is a bedroom?” I looked at her confused. “I know but since it is right off the stairs, we don’t use it often. I think the last time it was used was like three years ago. Anyway, it already has a bathroom in here. So you guys won’t have to leave to use one. There will be plenty of room for two desk and a small seating area off to the side. Maybe put a small bar against the far wall? However, it has a balcony and we can knock the closet out to make the room bigger.” GET IT NOW







###Chapter 152
Chapter 0152 “Sure.” Alec got up and came over to sit beside me. “Okay. Here is my inspo picture.” I moved to the tab with the picture of the g****e image. “I like it. Surprised you are choosing that.” “Why?” “Figured you would go for more like your shop.” “Oh, no. I didn’t want that for my office.” Fl*pping to the second tab, I showed him the paint and the rug. “Looks good. What about a desk.” “Keep an open mind.” I said as I fl*pped to the last tab. Alec was surprised but didn’t comment right away. “That’s what you want?” “Well, they need restored.” I said confidently. “That they do but if you can pull it off, those will be nice desks.” Alec agreed. “Do you even want a desk like that? I can find something more modern if you wanted.” I offered.

“No, I like what you picked out, it will just be an ordeal.” “Because I have so much on my plate right now?” I asked, sarcastically. Alec half smiled. “Something like that.” “Jeez.” I playfully pushed him. “You forgot flooring.” “Oh, I did! Can we not match the flooring that is already there?” “We probably could.” Alec thought about it. “Ask mom when she comes back here.” “Okay, did I spend too much?” “You barely spent anything.” Alec got up and went back to the desk and started working again. Hitting the buy button, it said it will arrive by wednesday. Apparently, her membership made for express shipping. “I’m going to start there and then we can decide how we want to decorate it after it is finished.” noveldrama

“Okay.” Alec was only half listening. “I’m going to go get my arm supplies.” I told him as I went to the door. “Want me to go with you?” Alec looked up at me. “That’s okay. I will only be gone five minutes.” “I’ll hunt you down after six.” Alec grumbled as he looked back at his papers. “Promise?” I asked as I walked out. Giving me an evil smile, he tried not to smile but went back to his paperwork. Going up the stairs, I was able to make it to get the art supplies before heading back. “You made it in thirty seconds to spare.” Alec muttered as I came back in. “Oh shoot, let me try again.” I joked as I sat down. Pulling out the sketch pad, I froze. What should I draw? My mind went to Ace and his dad planting the tree today. So, I started drawling what I think his tree would look like when it was fully grown. A massive Elm tree. One full of life with thick branches. The whole thing took me till lunch to complete. “That looks really good.” I hadn’t even noticed Alec behind me. I was finishing the shading when he spoke. “It’s what I think Ace’s tree will look like when it’s fully grown.” “I think that would look really good hung up in our new office.” Alec took the sketch pad and studied it. I was at a loss for words. More than once I had brought up Ace and he never got upset. Setting the sketch pad down, he looked at me. Without even thinking, my arms wrapped around his neck. Kissing him hard, he basically caught me and k*ssed me back. “Thank you.” I muttered as I let him go. “What was that for?” “For not being upset I drew that in memory of Ace.” “I accepted a long time ago that he might not have been your first love but I would be your last. Besides, he was still your best friend and more than once protected you. He died saving you and for

that, I am internally grateful. If hanging a picture that you drew in memory of him, helps you grieve, then I’ll do it.” I had no words so I just pulled his head down to me and k*ssed him again. That was until the door opened and Jasper and Emmy walked in. “Oh, sorry!” Emmy shrieked. “It’s fine. What are you guys up to?” I asked as we let go of each other. Alec took the page out of the book







###Chapter 153
Chapter 0153 “Seeing if you have ate lunch yet. We are headed down there now.” “We were about to do the same.” “Perfect!” Emmy smiled as she waited for me to grab my phone. Setting my purse off to the side, we left the office and walked down to the kitchen. It was packed as we made our way to the buffet. It had basic pastas, salads, breads and different kinds of meats for sandwiches. There was a whole bar for just fruits and veggies. Grabbing some bread, I made a sub and took some pasta before sitting down. I was the first person to sit down so I was by myself when a young girl approached me. “Hello, Luna Kristen.” Looking up, she was maybe around six or seven. With long brown hair, she had a little button nose with deep chocolate eyes. “EMILY!” A girl who I assumed was her mother ran up anxiously to her. “I’m so sorry she bothered you.” “Wait!” I said as she tried to lead her away. “I don’t mind. Actually, I love when people come up to me and say hello.” Standing up, I walked around and kneeled in front of her. Holding out my hand, I offered to

shake hers. “How are you?” Emily smiled and shook my hand. “I’m great! We are going swimming today!” “That’s wonderful! Do you like to put your head under the water?” I was vaguely aware the whole kitchen had gone quiet and was watching our interaction. “I do! I can blow bubbles! Mommy tells me I can’t swim in the deep part though.” She frowned and looked

up at her mom. Her mom blushed in embarrassment. “Well, mommy’s usually know what’s best. I think maybe we should always listen to your mommy, right?” “Oh yes, Luna. I ALWAYS listen!” She nodded quickly. “Good! That makes me so proud.” I smiled warmly at her. “I made this for you at school.” She held up a bracelet. It had pink and green beads on it and it said Luna with white beads. “You made this?” I asked shocked as I accepted the gift. “Yes! I like to make new friends.” Putting it on, I admired it. “Perfect fit! I’m glad we are friends now!” “Me too.” She flung her arms around me and hugged me tightly. Smiling, I returned the hug. “Did you eat all your lunch so you can go swim?” I asked. “Yes! Now that we are friends, can I ask you something?” She got really nervous and played with the hem of her mermaid swimsuit. “Of course, what do you want to ask?” “Mommy is really sad that she can’t find any books to read me. She said that the library is too small,” Looking up at her mom, she had her head, buried in her hands. “Is that right?” I asked, standing up. “You need a bigger library?” “It was just a random remark like a year ago. I can’t believe she even remembers that.” “It’s okay, you want a bigger library.” I looked down at Emily, lowering myself, I got to her eye level. “I love books. Let me see what I can do to make your mommy happy, okay?” “Thank you, Luna Kristen.” She smiled at me. Looking up at her mom, “See, mama, I told you she was nice.” “Oh, good gravy child. Let’s go swimming.” I think her mother hit her max embarrassment for the day.

“I have to go. Bye friend!” “Bye!” I said as I waved before standing up and going back to my chair. The kitchen started quiet whispering again as I started eating. “She was cute.” Emmy smiled at me. “She really was. I got a bracelet and you don’t!” I teased her. “I’ll have to spend time at the school now so I get more than you.” Alec leaned over and k*ssed my forehead before going back to eat his own sandwich. “Emmy, how is that pool project coming along?” I asked. “Nicely. We finalized the plans for the expansion and it will start in the fall.” “Great, so what are you working on now?” “I have a feeling it will be a new library.” Emmy said as she ate a strawberry.noveldrama







###Chapter 154
Chapter 0154 “Well, let’s look to see what all the libraries are here and if we can upgrade them or if we need to start all over. I rather use the existing buildings than made a new one. You can’t recreate that architecture.” “Give me this week. I took over the seating arrangements for Penny for prom. I need to finalize that and follow up with everyone.” “Why didn’t you tell me?” I asked, shocked. “It just happened this morning. She called me crying that she is emotionally struggling with it all and wanted to know if I could take something off her plate.” Emmy shrugged. “Your system you organized for me is really helping this come together.” “Come to the office this afternoon and I will help you finish the seating charts and call everyone.” I sighed. “I wish she would have called me.” “She wanted to but she didn’t want to you to think she was a failure or weak. She looks up to you and she didn’t want to disappoint you.” That shocked me a little. Maybe I need to do something nice for her. “That’s crazy.” noveldrama

“It’s really not. You pulled her out of an orphanage and gave her a life. She owes you everything. So does a couple other dozen people. You might not see it as a big deal but you have personally saved kids from becoming criminals.” I was silent for a little bit before I remembered Calvin had not brought me his drawings. “Alec, can you tell Calvin to bring me his drawings today.” He didn’t answer but nodded at me. Basically, I needed to relieve Penny of all her duties and allow her

to heal. She had taken on my shop and I needed to take it back. I just wanted her to heal and be the great person I know she can be. If she was calling Emmy for help, she needed a break. We finished eating in silence until we were finished. Jasper grabbed our plates as we stood to make our way to the office. Emmy ran to get stuff for the prom as we walked into the office. Picking up my phone, I dialed Penny’s number. “Hello?” She answered. Her voice was sad and mopy. “Penny, are you okay?” I asked as I sat down. “I’m fine. Just going day by day.” “Penny, I love you but please don’t lie to me “> “I’m sorry!” She started crying again. “I-” “Penny stop. You have nothing to apologize for. I know the stress you are under. Where is Colt?” “I’m right here.” He said. I must have been on speaker phone. “Good. Listen, I know you asked Emmy to take over the prom stuff.” “I didn’t want her to tell you. I can do it! I just..” “Penny stop. It’s okay. I am not mad at all! In fact, I think that is amazing that you knew when to ask for help. You are not weak for asking for a helping hand.” I saw Alec point a pen at me. Fl*pping him off, I kept talking. “I’m calling to let you know that I love you but I know you need a break. You need to focus on yourself right now and your connection to Colt.” “What do you mean?” Penny asked. “I’ll take over my shop. You basically have anything done anyway! You did such an amazing job that I will only have to see the finishing touches. This isn’t a punishment but a reward. You helped me out so much when my world seemed dark, now let me do the same for you.” 1 Penny’s so b were heard over the phone. “Thank you, Ice. That will really help with her stress level at

this time.” “Of course. If there is anything I can do to help…” I said. “Just stay safe yourself.” Colt sighed. “I will.” “Okay, love you.” Colt said to me. “You too!” I responded and hung up. “No-” There was a knock at our door. It wasn’t three yet so I was confused who it could be. Mrs. Smith Author ” Thank you all for reading! 4








###Chapter 155
Chapter 0155 Alec frowned as he got up to answer the door. “What are you doing here?” He asked as he turned and walked back to his seat. Angela walked in and shut the door. “I was hoping to catch you without that bi tch here.” “Was one broken jaw for you not enough or do I need to break the other for you to address me properly?” I said from the couch. “Anyway..” She completely ignored me. “I am here to ask about advancing into the kitchen or something more in the pack.” Standing up, I moved to sit on Alec’s lap, completely blocking him from view. She glared at me as I did this. “Actually, since I am the luna now, it is my responsibility to place people in job positions within this packhouse. So, it is really me that you need to speak with.” Grabbing the desk, I moved the chair up to the desk and leaned my elbows on it. The whole time, Alec was leaning back, enjoying the show.

Angela’s face was completely red in anger. “I wasn’t asking you.” Shoving my aura out, I watched it wrap around her, forcing her to fall to her knees and submit. “Now, that wasn’t so hard was it? Now, as far as your request. You want a job.” “Y-yes.” She said through gritted teeth. Emmy and Jasper walked in. They both smiled and took a seat watch as well. “Where so?” I asked. “The kitchen.” “Why the kitchen?” I asked. “I love to cook.” She answered still stuck in the submission pose.

“Where you wanting in there so you could poison me?” I was just having some fun but I didn’t expect her answer. “Y-yes.” She said quietly. Emmy and Jasper’s jaws dropped. Alec jumped up, sending me into the desk, making the air leave me. “YOU WHAT?” Alec roared. “I just love you and I don’t see why we can’t be together. If she wasn’t in the picture, we would be happy.” “You are lucky that you didn’t actually attempt at killing me or this would have been a different conversation but since you have imposed a threat on my life, I now have to grounds to banish you from this pack. However, I would rather keep a close eye on you.” I said as I straightened up. “You will in charge of cleaning out the cells everyday. You will not set a food back in this packhouse or cook another thing in your life. Do you understand?” I said firmly. 3 “Yes.” “Yes what?” “Yes, Luna.” She said angrily. “Get out of my sight.” Pulling back my aura, she stood up. “If you step out of line one more time, I’m just going to kill you.” Alec promised as Angela walked out of the office. “Ice, you really bring out the best of everyone.” Emmy attempted to make a light hearted joke. Alec growled as he sat back down, pulling me with him. He was trying to calm himself down. “I do try.” I agreed. After Alec padded my leg, telling me I could get up, I moved over to Emmy. “So, what do we have?” Jasper moved to stand behind Alec as they worked on stuff. 1 “Here is a list of all the names of people who have RSVP and their dates. I have also put into four

categories.” There was a list for each pack and and one for humans. “This is what I have set up so fa Emmy pulled out a map and showed me. There had circle tables of six. The tables seemed to have beer. placed stageredly and Emmy drew a line down making four different columns. “Well, each table needs a head table. I would put us over there and Darin and his gang on the far side. On our table, you have us four, plus Kevin and his date. On Colt’s table, you have him and Penny with Jacob and Sherry. Not that I think she will go but we need to include her regardless. Let’s put Anthony and his date with Colt. He is who I would assume Colt would upgrade to gam ma or beta eventually so that makes sense. The rest lets just fill in with who we know gets along.” GET IT NOWnoveldrama






###Chapter 156
Chapter 0156 It took us longer than we expected but it got finished. The seating chart was done and emailed over to the committee for approval. I put my name on it so it wouldn’t get changed. After us both making multiple calls, the prom was completely finished until the vendors show up to set up. Knock! Knock! Knock! Looking at my phone, it was 4:34pm. “I bet that is Calvin.” I muttered as Jasper walked by to answer the door. “Luna Kristen asked to see me.” Jasper let Calvin in. He looked nervously at Alec before walking over to me. “Hey Calvin. Did you bring your sketches?” I asked. “Y-yes, Luna.” He handed them to me but his hand was shaking. “Why are you so nervous?” I asked as I took the pad and started looking through it. These were pretty good but he needed to work on his shading technique. “Getting called to the Alpha’s office usually doesn’t mean anything good…Luna.” Touche, Calvin. “These aren’t too bad. What do you have planned for this summer?” I asked as I handed these back to him. “Oh um, not sure. Maybe be able to get into the training for warriors in late summer.” “Why don’t you do an internship with me to improve your technique and maybe learn some responsil

that will help you as you grow up.” That seemed to surprise him. “M-me? Why?” “Well, you seem like a good kid but you seemed to have a knack for getting into trouble. I employ many people who have started out as trouble makers but are not top of their class with promising careers. I think you have potential to grow and learn under me. Get some experience and really show Alpha Alec and the world what you can be when you get your mind to it.” “Yes, Luna.” Calvin gave me a small smile.

“Perfect, write your number down and I will call you when you can start. Hopefully next week.” Calvin did as I asked. “Thank you, Luna!” Calvin smiled at me before turning to leave. Stopping, he hesitantly turned and looked at me. “I can go…right?” “Yes, you may go.” He darted out the door, almost slamming it shut. “He will be a handful.” Jasper laughed as he sat down next to Emmy. “Yeah well, sc was Emmy when I found her.” I joked. I had to jump up fast before she could back hand me. Laughing, I moved over to the arm chair. My phone dinged telling me I had an email. Opening it, it was from the school. Telling me they needed to do an in-person testing and would like to schedule it for thursday. “Guys, we have to take our school tests on thursday with a teacher present but we can do it here.” “That’s fine.” Alec shrugged. Dialing Colt’s number, it rang three times before he answered. “Hello?” “How’s it going?” “I’m a little busy, what do you need?” “Oh, call me back when you can talk.” “I’ll be by in an hour to your pack and we can talk then.” “Okay.” “Are you okay?” “Yeah, I’m fine. See you soon.” I said and hung up. “What’s wrong?” Alec asked. at the phone, I got a weird vibe from that c “I didn’t like that call. Colt sounded… upset? Angry? I to talk.” asked how it was going and he said he was too busy noveldrama

“That doesn’t sound like Colt.” Emmy frowned. Looking over at her, “I know. He said he would be here in an hour so I guess we will see if he shows not, we will be going to him.” “It’s a good sign he answered his phone and not texted.” Jasper chimed in. “Yeah.” Looking down at my phone, this hour couldn’t pass quick enough. up. If “Why don’t we get supper for us and Colt and we can have a picnic under the tree?” Emmy suggested. “I’ll get it all organized and set up and I’ll see you there in an hour or so!”







###Chapter 157
Chapter 0157 “Thank you.” I gave her a smile as they left. “Come here.” Alec turned in his chair so I could sit down on his lap. “What if it is about dad?” “Love, everyone dies at some point. I know you aren’t ready for him to go but look at the life he is living. Constantly being with someone like A nn. He put up with her for the sake of being alive for you and Colt but now Colt can take over and if he dies, he will be free of her.” “I wish he would just tie her up somewhere and keep her from showing her face to the world.” “She would just command someone to untie her. Until Colt is the Alpha and she doesn’t have Luna status, there isn’t much anyone can do.” Alec was trying to show me reason but all I wanted to hear was her being locked in a cell. “I don’t know.”

“Why don’t you work on a drawing till it’s time for Colt to be here?” Alec was suggesting something to get my mind off Colt or my dad. “I’ll try.” Grudging, I got up moved to the couch. Picking up my sketch pad, I started drawing Alec. Mainly just his eyes but his whole head was there. Still, I started there. Usually my sketches are in black and white but for him, I picked up the green. Alternating between black and green, I was able to catch the intenseness of his gaze. However, it wasn’t anger that I was drawing… I was so engrossed in making sure the shading was correct that I almost missed Alec going to the door and opening it. “Colt.” Alec shook his hand. Relief flooded me. “COLT!” Jumping up, I ran and practically jumped on him. He caught me but had to take a few steps back. “I was so worried/

Setting me down, he looked confused. “Why? I told you I would be here.” “You told me you couldn’t talk to me! You never do that! I thought something happened to you.” Colt pushed me back to the couch ad Alec locked the door so we would not be interrupted. “You got me at a bad time.” Colt looked like he aged twenty years. “What’s going on?” Colt ignored me and picked up my drawing. “This is really good.” Alec had sat beside me but was leaning back. Colt handed the picture to Alec. “Have “No.” Alec studied it. “I literally just drew it. Like this last hour.” I watched Alec study my drawing of him. “Do you like it?” “I really do. This is amazing work.” Alec handed it back to me. “Just wait till it’s finished.” Setting it down, I turned to Colt. “So, spill.” My nerves shot up as Colt dropped his head. His elbows were resting on his knees as he leaned forward. “It’s been horrible. An n has switched from you to focusing on Penny now.” Colt didn’t look up at me. Instant guilt flooded me as my hand covered my mouth. “Noo.” I whispered. “Yeah. It’s been horrible. Dad’s threats aren’t working, she things she is untouchable. I can’t be around Penny everyday as dad has me doing some things and….” Colt trailed off as he shook his head. “Oh Penny and then everything with her father…” Alec leaned forward and placed his hand on my back. It was meant to keep my anxiety low, which helped but my guilt was still high. “Kristen, dad doesn’t have a choice anymore.” Colt’s eyes pleaded with me to understand. The fact he even called me Kristen spoke volumes. “Oh, dad…” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! noveldrama






###Chapter 158
Chapter 0158 “Sunday morning, dad is going to officially step down as Alpha. There will be an immediate ceremony for me to become Alpha and Penny to be Luna. The only people that know about this is us, you and your parents.” Colt said as he looked over at Alec. “As soon as the ceremony is over, he is going to reject A nn and I will be placing her in the cells.” “He won’t survive the night.” My voice was barely a whisper. “He knows that but he won’t let this go on any further. You found your mate and I found mine. Dad hoped this would wait till I was closer to 25 and he saw a grandchild but this is the way this needs to happen. If Penny got pregnant and A nn caused a miscarriage…” Colt’s eyes flashed black before going back normal. This is the only way to stop her. Besides, dad has wanted to get away from A nn for the last 15 years. He stayed to make sure you were okay and had a mate that would take care of you and I was ready to take over for him. His life mission is complete.” Colt rubbed his eyes like he was trying to rub the memory of dad’s words out of his head. As if they haunted him. “Why Sunday?” I asked quietly. “He is going to see the mission gets completed and to see you in your dress one last time.” Colt looked

like he was going to cry but somehow kept the tears from spilling over. “Why am I just now hearing about this?” “Because you are happy. Kristen, you have been miserable your entire life. Even with everything going o you are happy. Dad didn’t want to cause you anymore pain. You are loved here, treated like the princess you are…” I gave Colt a look that earned me a half smile. “… you are happy.” I couldn’t argue with him. Alec has made me the happiest person alive. He is everything I could have noveldrama

asked for in a mate and more. “What does A nn know about Sunday?” “She thinks we are having a family brunch.” Colt sighed and sat back. “We will have a full ceremony and do the whole thing but that will be later. Most important thing is protecting Penny and doing what is best for the pack.” It sounded like Colt was still trying to convince himself of this. “Penny can stay here for the week, I offered. “Thank you but I can’t leave the pack right now and I’m not staying a week away from Penny. Could you stay a week away from Alec?” Colt looked at me skeptically. I didn’t even answer as I sat back into Alec’s arms. He pulled me against him but otherwise didn’t make awkward to sit and talk to Colt. “I don’t even know what to say.” 1/2 “Only Alpha Marc and Luna Erin know. Jasper and Emmy cannot know until after. Only you four are able to be there. Jasper and Emmy will have to stay here.” We sat in silence for a few minutes while our minds went into their own directions. Mine went to the different times growing up that were special to me. Dad pushing me on the swing or buying my first art supplies. He would hang up my pictures to show them off proudly. “Kristen…” Colt pulled me out of my memories. “What?” “After dad… if dad… once I become alpha, all the property and investments become mine. We have to change the name of each one so An n can’t claim anything after. That means your tattoo shop, our bar and all the land.” Colt pulled out a binder that I didn’t even realize he had with him. “This is strictly for Alec’s and your eyes only. Not even Alpha Marc can see this.” Colt looked at Alec for confirmation. “You have my word.” Alec and I sat up but he kept his arm around me. “This is all the information laid out for you. Penny and I have signed them already. There is also a copy

of dad’s will in there. I wish I could give you more time to look this over but I need to get this all to the lawyer to have it notarized so all the paperwork will be in order. This way, An n doesn’t get anything and has no claim to any of it.”







###Chapter 159
Chapter 0159 My hands shook as I opened the black binder. The first page was the cover page to dad’s will. Resting my hand on top of it, I had to take a few deep breaths to be able to turn the page. It read: LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT 1, Brian Jefferys of the Blue Fang Pack, being fully of age, in my right state of mind, do make and publish this to be my last will and testament, hereby revoking and annulling any other publications made by me. Item 1 I direct my ownership of the store, Fang Tattoo, after my death to my daughter, Kristen Jefferys. Kristen will become the soul owner of Fang Tattoo to do with as she sees fit. It is my wish that she will be able to continue to grow and achieve her goals in life. Item II I direct my ownership of the bar, Fang Licks, after my death to my children Colt Jefferys and Kristen Jefferys. Colt will recieve 51% of the profit shares and Kristen shall recieve 49% of the profit shares. It is my hope that my children will continue to work together in making a successful life outside of Blue Fang Pack. Item III My beautiful daughter Kristen has always been the apple of my eye. With looks, she is her mother but he

heart is all her dad. It is the goodness she possesses that reminds me everyday what a kind and loving mother she had. Everyday, Kristen becomes more and more like her. Both in looks and in her generous heart. It is because of this, I will leave five million dollars to her after my death. It is my hope that she will use this money to either travel, grow her tattoo shop or use it in a way that brings nothing but joy to her

life. Item IV The bulk of my estate and the ownership of Blue Fang Pack will be pasted directly to my first born, my son, Colt Jefferys. Estimating to be worth up to 25 million net worth. Upon my death, the title of Alpha will be pasted to him without the possibility of any mate I have taking ownership away from him. This includes the all 150,000 acers of farming land that is not within the Blue Fang Territory. However, in the case of the untimely death of Colt Jefferys, unless he has produced an heir, the ownership will be transferred to Kristen Jefferys. If an heir is produced but is underage, Kristen will take ownership until the heir becomes of age. Item V 1/2 that I wish to leave. It is my belief that these items, although lack any financial gain, will be cherished still. To my daughter, Kristen Jefferys: – The contents of 318 Crestview Drive, Destin, Florida. The key is located in the envelope attacked to this packet. Although, I am leaving it all to daughter, it is my hope that she will share it with her brother. To my son, Colt Jefferys: – 920 SW Washington Ave. The house located at this address within our pack territory used to be owned by Adalynn’s family. She was the last remaining relative and when she died, I took ownership until it was time to pass it on. It is my hope that my son and his mate will be able to raise a family there. It is what Adalynn wanted and it is the life I wished I had given my children. The key is located in another envelope. – The rest of my profit shares that I personally hold. See other page for the full list and addresses. This concludes the LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT of Brian Jeffery’s, Alpha of Blue Fang Pack. noveldrama

Brian Jefferys, Alpha of Blue Fang Pack. “I….I have so many questions.” I didn’t know where to even start. How is Blue Fang worth that much? What other investments did dad have profit shares in? What was in Florida? Why did dad never take up to mom’s house? “I know, I only have a few minutes longer I can stay. All I can tell you right now is that dad kept mom’s family house a secret because he didn’t want A nn to destroy it. I just found out about it when dad gav me these papers to bring here yesterday. Dad wouldn’t tell me what was in Florida and the next page is a list of all dad’s investments.” It was like Colt read my mind. Fl*pping over to the next page, my mouth dropped.







###Chapter 160
Chapter 0160 “Did you know about this?” “No, I had no idea. I knew we had more money coming in than what the pack produced. I knew about the farming land. He only owns it. Humans actually farm it.” My eyes went down the list of all the investments dad had his hand in. “Yale? University of Califomia? Why what?” “I’m not sure exactly what he owns or does there but I looked them up. They are two of the top rated art colleges. I think dad wanted to make sure that…” Colt glanced over at Alec.” that had your mate been Ace, you would had a second option of attending art school to get out of the pack. I think it was his way of both bring in money and assuring you had a back up plan.” “All the rest of these are different restaurants or convention centers. This one is a hotel.” None of it made sense.

“Kristen, dad said he didn’t have to explain his methods to me but I believe he did all this because he saw what our lives were like. I looked into these. The first one he started was when we were seven years old. Years after mom died and two years after he mated An n. I think he knew back then that he needed a backup plan. If all else fails, we would have plenty of money to life or runaway on. He kept growing his empire. All we had to do was stay alive till we were old enough for him to die.” “There is even a contact list of people. Some of these are human government officials.” I couldn’t it. “I know. Dad was a businessman. He isn’t near as smart as you but he is where you got your brains.” It made sense. He wanted me to earn my own money, learn how to be responsible and not just hand it all

to me. Though, he probably hid it all so An n didn’t get her hands on it. “You will be a very wealthy man.” “Dad knew that regardless I would make sure you are taken care of. You have your chunk but obviously what is mine is yours. However, Alec is more than capable to taking care of you and your needs. It goes without saying that if you ever do need anything…” “When did dad write this?” I asked, not sure I wanted to know the answer to this question. “On our birthday. When he learned you had officially found your fated mate in Alec and completed the mating process. He knew you would be happy and well cared for. After watching Alec in the events leading up to our birthday, he clearly showed his commitment to you. He had already told me he was just about in love with you when he got shot. Dad and I both knew that you would be safe, happy and healthy.” “He’s been planning this…” o’s been planning this since we were seven. Dad played the long game.” Colt turned the pages over. T need you to sign now.” His hand shook as he handed me the pen. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! I greatly appreciate the review in helping me get a rating!noveldrama







###Chapter 161
Chapter 0161 “There, I did it.” Pushing the will away, I felt dirty. “I have to go but I needed to tell you Alec’s dad wanted you to call him.” Colt stood up as he gathered his stuff. “You think that is a good idea?” Alec asked Colt. “I think he is ready to apologize and forgive. He needs this last closure. The tree is planted. I had a plaque made and said it was from you. So, if he thanks you, that is what happened.” “Are you okay?” I asked Colt. “You are under a serious amount of stress right now.” “I am. I just have to make it through this week. With any luck, dad will be able to hang on a little.” I stood up and gave Colt a long hug. He hugged me back like it might be the last time he saw me. “Stay safe. I can’t worry about you too right now.” Colt looked haunted. “She is.” Alec stood up and pulled me into him. Colt nodded as he turned and left. Burying my head into his chest, my heart broke. “This has turned into a s hit show.” I muttered against his chest. “I know.” Alec moved us back to his couch. “You should probably just get this phone call done and ov

with.” “You’re right. I should.” Pulling out my cell phone, I hit dial on Ace’s home phone. It rang twice before there was an answer. “Hello?” “H-hello. This is …” “Kristen. Thank you for calling.” “Of course. What can I do for you?” I knew my voice was shaking. “I wanted to apologize. I appreciate you allowing me to say what I needed to say. Still, I’m sorry for how I acted. I know you loved Ace. I wish it was in a different way but the Moon Goddess knows what is best.

You are a good person and deserve happiness. I hope you found that.” a “I did.” I said as silent tears ran down my face. “Good. I appreciate the plaque as well. You will always be like a daughter to me.” “Thank you. “Have a good day.” He said before he hung up. “That went well.” Alec said as I laid back against him. “Yeah.” My eyes landed on the Will. “I can’t believe what I just read.” “Me either. Your dad really came through. Making sure you were taken care of.” “I can’t believe it. I just can’t. I never saw a dime of this money. Everything for the shop I had to pay back. Dad got me started and I didn’t make a dime till he was paid off.” “You learned the value of a dollar. Most alpha females are entitled and think money grows on trees.” “That is true.” “Does this change if you want to travel?” Alec asked. “I want to see what is in Florida.” “We can start there.” Alec agreed. “I would like to go to my mother’s family house too.” “We can but we need to wait till after saturday. We can’t f uck anything up. “Okay. I don’t know how I am going to keep this from Emmy though.” The whole situation sucked. It almost two weeks ago and my biggest worry was where I wanted to travel to. Not that I would give Ai up for anything but I did have very little headache. “I’m sure you will be busy with the shop to really pay attention. Before you know it, saturday will be here.” “Yup…” I didn’t even have the motivation to do any work today. “Do you want to watch movies this afternoon?” “Seriously? You don’t have work to do?” I looked up at him. “Nothing that can’t wait till tomorrow.” Alec stood up and reached out for my hand. “Come on. Let’s just noveldrama

relax and watch a few movies. I have popcorn…” “What did I do to deserve such a great mate?” It was a rhetorical question but Alec answered anyway. “I am pretty good, aren’t I? I guess the Moon Goddess loves you.” “Anyway…” I gave him a ‘really’ look. “What movie are you picking out?” I asked as we started up the






###Chapter 162
Chapter 0162 “What are you in the mood for?” Alec asked. “Something funny.” “Hmm, let me see what I got.” Alec unlocked the bedroom door. “Why don’t you start the popcorn.” “Yes, sir.” I said sarcastically. “What happened to yes, alpha?” Alec teased me without even looking at me. “That is for the bedroom.” “We are technically in the bedroom.” Touche. “When we are n*ked in the bedroom and your di ck is in my mouth.” “That can be arranged.” Alec put in a movie and turned off the lights as it came on. The popcorn just started popping as he walked over to me. “Do you want water or Dr. Pepper?” “Dr. Pepper, please.” Grabbing a bowl, I started tapping my fingers on the counter. “What movie did you pick out?” “Bridemaids.”

“Seriously?” I looked at him and smiled. “What? It’s hilarious when she s hits in the street.” The microwave dinged. Alec went to the couch and I put the popcorn in a bowl. Just the smell of it made my stomach growl. Shoving a handful in my mouth, I sat down by Alec but not touching. Instead, I put the popcorn between us. Angling my b*dy so I was facing him, he pressed play. This felt good, felt right. We didn’t have to cuddle or have S** to enjoy each other’s company. We sat beside each other and ate popcorn, Laughing at the funny scenes and judged the dressed the girls tried on. This was another form of intimacy that you can’t achieve unless you are fully comfortable with a person. I knew I loved him. I knew he was learning me and I was learning him but sitting here. I watched his face light up and laugh. This is when I fully understood what it meant to have a secondnoveldrama

half. A soul mate. This… this was my forever. The next morning, I woke up to my phone buzzing. It was an email alert that seemed to never shut up. Peaking through just one of my eyes, I tried to read it. “What’s that?” Alec asked as he rolled over. His arm wrapped around me and pulled me tightly against 1/2 “I got an email.” “About what?” “My shipment for my store will be here around mid-day. They need a signer.” Groaning, I tossed my phone down and curled into Alec. “Honey, we need to get up and get going. I’m sure there will be a few things that you need to do at the shop before hand.” “But I’m comfortable.” Wiggling a little more, I was as close to him as I could possibly be. “Who know you were the clingy type.” Alec laughed. “The f uck!” Pushing him away instantly, I had jumped out of bed before he even realized what happened.” I am NOT clingy.” Putting my hands on my hips, I tried to glare but he was trying not to laugh. “What is so funny?” “You are kind of clingy. Now that you have completely opened up to me, you are clingy.” “Am not!” “You love me.” Alec gave me a look. “Not right now!” Huffing, I stomped to the bathroom to shower. His annoying laughter followed me whole way. However, I refused to shower with him so I made sure mine only lasted a few minutes be getting out. He had just walked in as I stepped out. “That was a quick shower.” Alec raised an eyebrow at me.

“Got things to do today.” I shrugged as I walked pasted him. “Really? Going to have this petty sarcastic attitude all day?” Alec was still trying not to laugh. There was nothing but amusement coming from him. “I have no idea what you mean.” Glaring, I picked out some spandex and a lightweight workout shirt. My mind was made up, I was going to tease the f uck out of him all day to make him the clingy one tonight. Putting my hair in the side braid he likes best, I left my face bare. However, I did put on the necklace he gave me. By the time I was putting on my shoes, he was out of the shower. The towel sat low on his hips, forcing me to look away. I couldn’t cra ck already. 2/2







###Chapter 163
GET IT NOW Chapter 0163 Alec sl*pped on a pair of gym shorts and a tank. He had sat down to put on his shoes, giving me the perfect opportunity. As I walked by, my phone happened to sl*p out of my hands and fell to the floor. Completely bending over in front of him but just outside his reach, I fully bent over to get it. Giving him at good view of my as s. I knew he saw me by the shot of arousal I got from him but it was quickly replaced. by amusement again. “Ready?” I asked as I stood back up and walked to the bedroom door. Alec stood up and walked over to me. His eyes landed on the necklace before going back up to mine. “Oh yes.” His face was passive. Dam n, this might be harder than I thought. Walking into the hall, Alec shut the bedroom door and locked it. “We have time to get breakfast before going to the store.” I said. “You want breakfast?” Alec seemed surprised. “Maybe a mu ffin or something. Why?” It surprised me that he was surprised. “You’re not exactly a morning person. You don’t eat much breakfast and lately your appetite has been that

of a bird.” Alec shrugged. Well, s hit. When did he learn all this about me? “Maybe I am tried of being mopy and I want to feel happy.” The sarcasm was thick. “I would like you to be happy too but life as been rough lately. I half expected you to be kind of gloc “It’s nice to know I can still surprise you after all these days of being together.” I nodded as I opened t. kitchen doors. Alec gave me a look that told me he wasn’t buying it. Thankfully, he didn’t argue as we went to the buffet.

As I had said, I grabbed a chocolate, chocolate chip mu ff in and a water. Sitting down, I waited for Alec to get done. By the time I finished my mu ffin, he still hadn’t sat down. Looking over, a couple girls had stopped him and by the look of his face, he wasn’t too pleased. Jasper and Emmy made their way over before he even sat down. “Hey girl. What are you up to today? Kind of early for you to be awake.” Emmy looked at me funny. “First off, don’t say that in front of Alec. I’m trying to prove a point. Second, I got an email that the order is being delivered today and they need a signer so we are headed over there when he gets done eating. However, by the looks of it, he may never get to eat.” at do they Jasper asked. “No clue. They walked to him and I wasn’t too worried to go figure it out.” Shrugging, I sat back in my chair. “You really don’t get jealous do you?” Emmy shook her head. “Not usually. Maybe I am weird like that.” “Don’t worry, I love it when you get jealous over me.” Jasper ran his finger down her cheek. Emmy blushed as he k*ssed her nose. “Gross. Literally gross.” Finally, Alec sat down as I spoke. “What’s gross?” “Them. Just them.” “Don’t hate on us because you are incapable to being a loving mate!” Emmy said in her own defense. “Alec, am I a loving mate?” “Sure are.” He said as he took a bite of something. noveldrama

“See?” “Why don’t you k*ss him them? Show me you love him!” Emmy pushed. “It’s like you don’t even know me.” Shaking my head in disapproval. I will not be giving in to her pe pressure. “Alec, does it bother you she doesn’t get jealous?” Emmy was getting annoyed now. “No. Why would it? That isn’t who she is.” Alec shrugged. “WE are not the strange ones. It’s you two who are strange.” She crossed her arms and sat back as she pretended to glare at us. “Are you the jealous type Alec?” Emmy was switching tactics.







###Chapter 164
Chapter 0164 “She hasn’t given me a reason to be jealous.” Alec said after a moment. “So, you would be okay if a random guy came over here and gave her a hug?” Emmy pushed. “If a random guy tried to touch her, she would probably throat punch him.” Alec said, without even thinking about it. Emmy grudgingly had to agree to that. “Whatever. One day, one of you will get jealous and I will be here to laugh and say I told you so.” Emmy stood up and pointed her finger at us. “It will happen and you two…. will have it coming.” She stormed out as Jasper tried to hide his smile but went after her. “When was the last time she got laid?” Alec asked me. “Apparently, Jasper isn’t holding up his end of the bargain.” I laughed as Alec finished eating. “Do you get jealous?” I asked. “Only before we were mates. You didn’t want to open up to me and I had a hard time reading you.” Alec shrugged. I knew there was more. I’m sure he would never admit it but I think Ace made him really jealous.

“Hmm…” That almost sounded like a challenge but I had more respect for him than to make him jealous. “Don’t you f ucking dare try.” Damit, he caught on. “ME? I would never do that to you.” I faked being hurt. Alec rolled his eyes at me as he got up and too. our trash to the trash. I heard some girls giggling a table over, I didn’t realize we had an audience. “Ready?” Alec asked as he came back and pushed in his chair. “Yeah. I am.” Standing up, I walked in front of him the whole way to the car. Part of me wanted to take our bikes but if we needed to bring anything back with us, that wouldn’t be good. However, I would be able to

tease him this way too. As he pulled out, he floored it, making me toss my phone in the back. “Really?” Alec asked. “That was a tad dramatic.” “Oh, sorry.” I said as I turned around to grab my phone. Shoving my as s over at him, I made it look difficult to get my phone. “Do you need help?” Alec asked after a minute. “Nope. I got it here.” Sitting back up, I got comfortable again. “Good.” Alec moved his hand to rest on my thigh. 1/2 “Have you seen my Tor “No, why?” “Just curious” “You’re talkative today.” Alec muttered. “Sorry?” Slightly hurt, I looked out the window. “I’m not saying it’s a bad thing but you’re acting strange.” “Stranger than Emmy?” “No one is stranger than Emmy.” Alec concluded. “True.” Feeling slightly defeated, I just looked out the window and tried to act sullen and moody like he thought I should be acting. We didn’t talk the rest of the way to the my store. Which, surprised me. I was feeling rather hurt and annoyed but he didn’t comment. Instead, I just kept my mouth shut and when we got there, I went inside without waiting for him. Everything was there but still wrapped up. The chairs needed assembled, my office laptop was still in its package and there was a layer of dust around everything. Taking a moment to look around, I started with noveldrama

the front. The front desk was taller. Penny got it right with how it would allow me to see the entire shop and still have privacy. Behind it, was my office. It wasn’t large since we didn’t have much room to sta* with but it was private. A small desk sat against the wall. What surprised me was a blanket covering something in the car corner. It was larger but a sign on it said, ‘Ice-Keep out’. Moving on, there was a built in 360 mirror beside the bathroom. They had indeed created more room i the bathroom but kept the layout the same. The sage green I had picked was amazing. It was honestly everything I envisioned this being. The cabinets looked great. The ink room was slender but had a ton of shelves. A single countertop was waist high so I could lay out what I needed. This was perfect. Just what I wanted and needed.







###Chapter 165
Chapter 0165 As I looked around. Alec stood and watched me. “What do you think?” “It’s amazing.” I said before I grabbed some scissors and started cutting the plastic off the tattoo chairs. “Just amazing?” “Perfect? Everything I wanted? What adjective did you want?” “Your moods are all over.” Alec rolled his eyes at me. Slamming down the scissors, I stood up and laid into him. “You know what? This is f ucking bu lls hit. I just had to sign my father’s will, got told he could very well die on Sunday and within this last week, my shop was destroyed, one of my best friends died, I’ve been in two separate rogue attacks and car crashes. Not to mention the crazy guy that thinks he has dibs on me. I think I am holding it all together nicely. I f ucking tried to have a good attitude and you got annoyed at me for that. Now, I am back to being sulky and you are pis sy with that. What can I do to make you f ucking happy? I gave you my heart, my b*dy and you are

going to tell me how I am suppose to reach to all this? You have been incredibly supportive this entire time… until now. What do you want from me?” My wolf was getting worked up. I knew my eyes had changed by the look in Alec’s face. The anger was building. How does one shift between all these feelings? I wasn’t someone that crawled under the covers and ignored the world. “You’re right. I’m sorry.” Alec held up his hands as he walked towards me. “I don’t want to hear, I’m sorry. I want to know how you think I should respond to all this?” Crossing my arms, I dared him to speak. “I just…” Alec came up to me and placed his hands on my shoulders. The calming affect was instant and that partially annoyed me. “I just want you to be okay. I want you to feel these emotions so you can work through them. Hiding behind humor or S**ual feelings isn’t going to change what has happened or what

could happen. Holding it all in isn’t healthy.” “I’ll process them in my own time, not when you think I should do it.” I said stubbornly as I pulled away from him. “Did you not see how stressed out Colt was? He has always been the emotionally level twin. For him to be this stressed out is a big f ucking deal. He has always been someone that I counted on to be level headed and to see things clearly. For him to be like this, I can only imagine what is going on over there. Selfishly, I refuse to go over there. Next time I see An n, she will be ash. You want me to f ucking feel things? FINE! I feel guilty I am not over there helping him. I feel s hitty that Penny has basically replaced me as An n’s punching bag.” I started assigning feelings to each finger. “I am heartbroken my dad might die on Sunday. Confused as to what is in Florida. I am unbelievably pis sed off that Darin has f ucked up De goes your b*dy would y gualty that Ace died to protect the One of my best trends died for much makes me fa dys for being so happy with your stugad as s F ucking scared that all of this has kept you fr coming ache Your own mother told us that because of me you don’t get the just yet are could challenge you at any moment and while I believe you will win The thought of having our bond transfer so “I couldn’t even find the words to describe that “And finally, I have to still be happy for the pack, happy this place is getting done, happy for Emmy and everyone I honestly don’t know what you want from me. I am literally giving you all I have to give. There is nothing left in me right now” There wasn’t even tears to spiltnoveldrama








###Chapter 166
Chapter 0166 Alec didn’t move but just stared at me. It was hard to read him as I wasn’t getting much emotions from him. After a minute of just staring at eachother, I just sighed and got back to work. Getting on my hands and knees, I pulled out the instructions and started unwrapping it all. As much as I tried to ignore Alec, he stood there and watched me until finally he walked away. He picked up some rags and started wiping everything down. We worked for close to an hour before there was a knock at the front door. I had just finished the one chair before I realized my order was here. Alec had set his stuff down and went to answer it. After signing for it, three men started pulling out different boxes and placing them in the middle of the store. This was much more than just some ink. After they left, I just looked at everything. “What did she all buy?” I whispered to myself. Grabbing the scissors, I started opening it all. There was a mirror for the bathroom, a toilet paper holding and other bathroom accessories. There was a book stand for my non-existent portfolio. Penny basically furnished my entire office. While Alec put away the ink, I kept breaking down the boxes and cleaning up. At one point, Alec stepped outside to make a phone call. I wasn’t sure what to fell towards him but I was started to feel lonely. Like I wanted to make up with him and get a hug but I was being too stubborn to just make the first move. Once all the items were opened and the boxes were broken down, I carried them all to the back to put noveldrama

into recycling. By the time I got back into the store, Colt was standing in the middle of my shop. “Colt? What are you doing here?” I asked as I glanced at Alec. Neither man gave anything away a closer. “This isn’t good.” “Nothing is wrong.” Colt gave me a little smile that did nothing to change how I felt. “Then why are you here? Is Penny okay?” “She is fine. I actually sent her to live at our mother’s house. She isn’t permitted to leave and I visit her

when I can. This way, she is out of the packhouse and she isn’t far so my wolf isn’t going crazy.” I had so many questions but none would actually come out. Instead, I looked at both guys, trying to figure this out. “I am literally the smartest person I know and I am so confused right now. Someone better start talking.” “You’re not okay.” Colt said finally. My eyes instant went to Alec. “You called my brother because I blew up at you?” “It isn’t me that you need comfort from right now.” Alec said slightly annoyed and partially accepting acceptance. are all official and copies were prepared. Nothing else to do. Now, it’s a waiting game. Until saturday, the only thing we have to look forward to is thursday when we take our tests.” Colt’s arms dropped at he spoke to me but didn’t make a move to me. “Penny is safe?” I asked. “Yes, she is under guard but the house is amazing. I can’t wait for you to see it. It is two stories with a full basement. A little outdated but it’s what we pictured our mom to be like. Remember as kids we would make a pretend mom and design her? Well, that house is what we thought it would be.” Colt gave me a small smile. “And dad?” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you everyone for your support. I am posting this early due to today is my wedding anniversary and we are going out! I hope everyone has a good weekend!







###Chapter 167
Chapter 0167 “Dad has been cleaning his office. Creating files with passwords for me to have. Basically preparing to switch over alphaship. He is actually the happiest I have seen him in years.” “Happy?” “Yes, Ice. Dad is happy. He is finally free of An n. I got more of the story. An n and dad used to date as kids but when dad found out he was actually mated to mom, he dumped A nn. An n obviously never got over it so when mom died, guess who was there to help dad? His wolf was suffering and she was there. One night, when things got really bad, dad agreed to mate with An n so he would still be around to raise us. A nn was doing everything for us at that time so he thought she would be a good mate. When we got older and it was evident she held a grudge for us not being her biological kids, that’s when he started investing. Since he barely survived because of mating with A nn, he didn’t want to die and leave us as orphans. Now, we are fully capable of taking over and he is happy to finally be free of An n. Dad is ready to go or to accept whatever is will happen.” “But earlier, you said…” “I know what I said but dad and I had a long conversation last night. He told me all that and told me this wasn’t a choice he didn’t want to make but one he has been looking forward to. I think he will be seeing him smile as he dumps An n.” My eyes looked down as I digested what he said. It made sense. Not that it made it easier but I didn’ so guilty. “And saturday?” I asked looking back up at him.

“We don’t f ucking scare easily. We will attack and enjoy every minute of it. You have a part you have play though. Darin won’t have any idea what is happening so we will all have to tread carefully but I thin saturday will end up being a great night.” Colt said with a smile. He rocked back on his heels as he looked at Alec. Alec nodded in response but kept looking at me. This was a hard pill to swallow. I could see why he would be happy to escape her but I still would never

understand why he stayed unhappy for 18 years. Maybe when I have kids I will understand but right now, my heart hurts for him. “Did you ever find out anything with the cell phones?” I asked. “They are linked to a building in the city. We don’t have confirmation about it yet but it was one of the buildings we have been watching for any connection with Alpha Rip. The messages are clear, they wanted to kidnap you.” “So, I was right.” I clarified as I looked between the two most important men in my life. “You were. Your life is in serious danger.” Colt agreed. “Still, you can finish up here. We aren’t asking you to put your shop on hold…” but it would put myself and others at risk for unnecessary harm.” I finished for him. “Correct.” Colt put his arms in his pockets. After a few minutes, I sighed. “I’ll hold off until this is finished.” “I think that is smart of you.” Colt had to get a dig in. I returned his smile with a frown of my own. “This place is really starting to shape up nicely.” “Thanks to Penny. She really came through.” I agreed as the fight was leaving me. Colt walked up to me and put his arms around me. “Everything will be okay. Sometimes, it is okay to be selfish and worry about yourself. The one reason I am able to handle what I have been is because I know you are safe here. Are you happy here?” I peaked around at Alec. “Mostly.” Alec rolled his eyes. “Ice?” Colt pushed me in my side a little. “Yes, I am happy.” Colt pulled my face back towards him. “Do you feel safe?”noveldrama

Chapter 0168 “That is all I care about. I have spent 17 years of my life watching out for you and making sure you were as enfe as possible. I love you but you really took up a good chunk of my life.” Colt joked. “Jeez, how nice of you.” I tried not to smile. “Knowing you are safe and happy here is allowing me to do what i need to do on my end. Yes, I was upset, frustrated and stressed but as you can see, I am good now. Twelve hours later and I am back to my old self. All problems solved. You just need to worry about you and passing your test on thursday” “I could have past them when I was ten.” I said slightly annoyed but trying not to smile. “If you would have done that, you wouldn’t have met Alec.” Colt pointed out. “I met him here, not at school.” I reminded him. “But it was school that he heard about you.” “That’s a stretch but since I’ll get a better grade than you, I’ll give it to you.” I said as I patted him on the arm. “What a good little sister!” Colt patted the top of my head before he forced me into a full hug. “Can’t breath!” I faked after a few minutes. “Do you feel better now?” Colt asked as he pulled me away but kept his hands on my arms.

“I do.” “You could try to have a little more faith in me.” Colt faked looking hurt. “I get frustrated one time and this is how you respond?” “Hey! It wasn’t just you but everything. A lot has happened these later two weeks.” I said in my defense as I slapped his arm. “I’ll give you that but you need to remember it is okay to not be okay. I do need you to be strong in public but it’s okay to not be okay behind closed doors. I would say cry but…” Colt trailed off.

“Alright. I’m done talking about it.” I said as he was starting to hit too many emotions after he fixed my broken ones. “I love you, sis.” Yean, Colt gave me a look. “I thought you were past that?” “Past what?” “Not liking saying I love you.” “I reserve them for true heartfelt moments.” I gave him a ‘I don’t know what to tell you’ look. “This isn’t a heart felt moment?” “You were always the cheesy one.” I laughed. “Alright well, I love you but I got to go.” “L-love you too.” I said sarcastically. “Needs some improvements but I’ll take it.” Colt shook his head at me. “Good, because that is all you are getting.” Colt smirked before turning and shaking Alec’s hand. They even did a little bro hug before Colt walked out of the shop. I just stood their and looked at Alec awkwardly for a second before he sighed and walked up towards me. “Feel better now?” “Maybe.” I said as I looked down and away from him. A little growl escaped Alec as he bent over and grabbed the back of my thighs. He picked me up a wrapped my legs around him before he carried me to a counter top and set me down. I was comp pinned. His hand cupped my neck before grabbing some hair and forcing me to look at him. A soft mo escaped my l*ps as I looking into his eyes. “I’ll never understand the power Colt has over you but this b*dy is mine to work.” He said huskily as he lowered his l*ps against mine. My hands sl*pped under his shirt to his bare skin. Too soon, he moved his head back to look into my eyes.

“I’m sorry.” I said without thinking. “You have nothing to be sorry for.” Alec searched my eyes. “Feels like I do.” “Are you happy with me?” Alec asked. “What kind of question is that?” I was a little taken aback. “After all we have been through, you arenoveldrama






###Chapter 169
Chapter 0169 “No, not questioning it, just wanted you to say it.” “Alec, you make me the happiest girl in the world.” My hand sl*pped out of his shirt to touch his face. “You are my mate, the other half to my soul and the love of my life. You get every part of me, the good, the bad and the ugly. You’re the lucky one that gets to deal with my mood swings.” Alec’s hands were on either side of my face as I spoke. “You know I will die before anything happens to you.” I said as if he was trying to reassure me. “You took a bullet for me. I know that.” Pulling his face down to mine, we k*ssed softly for a few minutes. “We should get back to work.” Alec said as he broke free. Grabbing his shirt, I helped him take it off. “That’s better.” “Me shirtless is better?” He asked confused. “Yeah, I get some eye candy as I work.” I smiled up at him. As much as he tried to hid it, it was smiling. “Get your as s back to work.” Alec said as he helped me down. “Yes, alpha.” I said as I walked away form him and swayed my hips. Alec’s eyes narrowed but he went noveldrama

back to cleaning up the dust. After another fifteen minutes, one tattoo chair was put together. “Only three more to go.” “That looks good.” Alec came over and looked at it. “Thanks. This one is mine. I still have… the bell on the door dinged as some teenagers came through. “We heard you were working here today and I was wondering if you needed help.” Calvin smiled at me as his posse of friends looked around in awe. “That would be great. You guys can put together these chairs!” I said instantly relieved. “That should be easy enough.” Calvin said looking at it. “That chair took me an hour and fifteen minutes.” I said as Alec helped me stand up. “Dam n. Okay.” The kids instantly got to work, allowing me to put the rest of the store together. Alec

hung all the mirrors for me and any decor Penny had bought. Although Alec set up all the ink, I reorganized it how I liked it before moving to my office. As I opened the laptop box, I accidentally hit something over. “What was that?” I whispered as I reached around and picked up a picture frame. It had Alec and I, “I had that printed. Figured it would make a good decor in here.” Alec was standing in my doorway. Leaning against the frame, he had his arms folding and looking like a snack. “Thank you, that was really sweet.” I set it back up before continuing to open my laptop. “Everything is cleaned. I have the bathroom set up as well.” Alec didn’t move as he watched me start the computer up. “You are amazing.” I gave him a smile. “Can we talk for a minute?” Alec asked as he came inside and shut the door. My office wasn’t the biggest but since I enjoyed being close to Alec, it wasn’t stuffy. “Uh oh.” I said as I glanced at him. “Next monday, I want to go to Florida for a week.” My b*dy froze. The computer dinged, asking for permission to continue on. Instantly on guard, I pressed okay before answering him. “Why?” “Everything has been incredibly stressful for you. You can’t even argue with me.” It was like he knew what I was going to say before I did. “Sunday might be really struggling. If your dad ends up passing, I want to go to Florida. If he doesn’t, then we hold off.” I was quiet for a few minutes as I followed the steps my laptop asked of me. “Why are you wantin this now? I thought it was my choice if I wanted to travel or not.” Mrs. Smith Author







###Chapter 170
Chapter 0170 “It’s not exactly a vacation or what I would consider relaxing regardless. I think your dad left you stuff there. I looked up the address. It’s a storage unit. I honestly think he took all your mother’s possessions and hid them there. With An n gone, you would finally be able to have them. I think it would be a good idea to go and get them or whatever is in there.” “It’s a storage unit?” I asked as I turned to look at him. He got down on one knee and looked at me. “It is. It’s not about getting you away or anything. Whatever is in the storage unit, you dad felt it was important enough to hide there. Somewhere A nn obviously didn’t know about. If he left it for you, I think he wants you to get it and cherish whatever it is.” “I guess I assumed my mother’s stuff would have been in her house.” I said as I thought about it. “I don’t. That house is on her territory. She is luna. She can do whatever she wants and if she ever found out about that house and set fire to it, all the stuff would have been gone too. This way, he saved the stuff, even if the house is destroyed.” “That would make sense, I guess.”

“Will you just think about it?” Alec asked softly. “I will.” “Thank you. How close are you to being done?” Alec stood up. “Yeah, why?” “I was thinking we could go for a bike ride this afternoon.” Alec raised is eyebrows at me. “I like the way you think.” Smiling, I stood up and closed the computer. Alec had opened the office door for me. “We are finished!” Calvin yelled as I walked out. “Those look great!” They had all three chairs done and was tightening them to the floor. A few of the noveldrama

other kids had gathered all the trash and took it out while another one swept all the dirt and dust up. “Thank you!” Calvin stood up and admired his work. “Everything is about ready to go.” I said looking around. It was getting late and I hadn’t ate anything since breakfast. “When are you opening?” Molly asked. Alec grabbed his shirt to put it on. Not sure yer Alec walked over to the door and held it open for them. “Anytime! Glad to be able to.” Calvin and his gang walked out the store. We followed them out before! locked it tightly. “I think that is a nice thing you are doing for him.” Alec said once we were in our car. They had drove off as Alec started his car. “Someone has to replace Penny.” “Is that even possible?” Alec asked as he drove down the street. Rolling the window down, I let my hand hang out the window in the breeze. “Nope. She was truly one of a kind. What ever happened with who her dad was?” “Nothing yet. We stopped looking openly. We wanted to lay low until after Saturday.” Alec put his hand on my thigh. “I’m hungry.” I said to Alec. “That’s a first. Want to get bbq?” “Yes, please!” “Okay, we can get changed and then head there.” Alec agreed. “Do you want to invite Emmy and Jasper?” I asked. “We haven’t really hung out with them in a long time.” Alec frowned. “We did pis s Emmy off this morning so it would be a good makeup thing.”

“Emmy pis sed herself off this morning.” Alec grunted. I died laughing as Alec started laughing beside me. “You’re not wrong.” I said after I caught my breath. We had pulling into the garage as I dried my eyes. “Are you going to ask them since I am still uncapable to mind-linking someone?” I asked as we went inside. 1 “We really need to fix that.” Alec muttered. “Well, your mother is handling that. You will have to ask her when you finally get to claim me.” I muttered as we walked up the stairs. Stopping on the second floor, we walked to Jasper’s room.







###Chapter 171
Chapter 0171 “We could just do a small ceremony in dad’s office so you can mind-link people.” Alec offered as he knocked on the door. “Though, I’m not sure I need Calvin to have that much access to me.” I laughed as Jasper opened the door. He only had shorts on. “Did we interrupt?” “No.” Jasper shrugged as he let us in. Emmy was sitting on the couch, typing away on her computer. “We are just working from our room today.” “Why so?” Emmy glared at me as I walked over to her. “Still pis sy?” “I was never pi ssy.” “Well good because we were going to invite you guys to take a ride with us to get BBQ.” Leaning down, I noticed she was working on blueprints for a new pool. “You can’t put the slides there. They need to be noveldrama

here.” I said instantly. “What, why?” You can’t have the slide drains overlapping your pool drains.” Emmy frowned. Slamming her computer down, she stood up. “I could use some fresh air and food. However, if you want to look at my blueprint for one second and find an error than you will be coming the pool with me this afternoon and helping me fix it.” I stood and looked at her. She has been incredibly moody lately. Her face was a little puffy and there was a glow to her. “Are you pregnant?” I looked at both guys and their jaws had dropped. Emmy’s face went pale as her mind started racing. “Pregnant? You think I am pregnant?”

“Your mood swings… just, when was the last time you had your period?” Emmy opened her mouth but closed it again. “Emmy?” Jasper asked. He was clearly confused and shocked. “You guys have been together long enough that if you got pregnant on the first time you f ucked, you could be. Wolf pregnancies are quick and ranking members even quicker.” I shrugged. Emmy ran to the bathroom and shut the door. I could hear a few drawers open and close before I heard “Yeah. I mean, it would be extremely early but it’s possible. You guys have been mated a whole week longer than us.” I shrugged. Jasper started pacing as I walked over and stood by Alec. The clock slowly ticked each second as it went around a few times. Jasper was ready to lose his s hit when Emmy opened the bathroom door. She was visibly shaking as she looked at Jasper. Her hand covered her mouth as she shook her head yes. “You’re pregnant?” Jasper clarified as he walked up to her. “I am…” He had to take the test from her since she was shaking so bad. “Oh, Em.” Jasper wrapped her in a hug as he was processing his own emotions. “I’m going to be a dad?” Sl*pping my arm through Alec, we watched them process the news. Emmy had tears running down her face faster than Jasper could wipe them away. “Let’s give them some space.” I whispered to Alec. He nodded and we left their room and went up to ours. “I guess you could be pregnant too.” Alec said after a second. “Well, that would be too early to know but I guess I could be. Timing is not ideal, we should probably be more careful.” I said as I pulled down my pants and grabbed a tank top. “I don’t know. A little kid running around seems fun to me. Then they would be the same age as Jasper and Emmy’s kid, best friends even.” “You want a kid now?” I asked. “What happened to traveling?” I asked. “The kid can come with. I want a whole gang of kids.” Alec came up behind me and wrapped his a. around me. “You would be so f ucking s exy with a belly with my child in it.”

“Back up there, there’s not baby there yet!” I pushed him away so I could pull my pants up. “There will be if you keep wearing those pants.” Alec made a whole show of looking at me up and down. I was tucking my tank into them.







###Chapter 172
Chapter 0172 “I thought you liked my birthday suit the best?” I laughed as he stuck his tongue out and came at me again. Dodging him, I grabbed my boots. “Oh, I do but I like the whole process. You know, see the goods then you have to go find them.” Alec grabbed his own shirt and put it on. “Well, I doubt Emmy and Jasper are going to want to go swimming but we can go back to that little pond in the woods after we eat.” I said as I slowly walked up to him. Rubbing my hands down the sides of my breast and past my thighs, his eyes got dark. He was leaning against the couch so it was easy for me to sl*p between his legs and press my b*dy against his. Alec’s hands instantly went to my a ss. “Hmm, I like the sound of that.” Alec whispered. WRapping my arms around his neck, I pushed my breast into his as my hands went through his hair.

“Hmm, we could ski p the BBQ, I’ll eat something else.” Alec whispered as our l*ps grazed each others. He started leaving small k*sses down my neck and to my breast that were popping out. One hand of his cupped my ti t and squeezed hard. “But Alpha… I whispered in his eat. I felt and watched goosebumps run down his b*dy and visibly shake when I called him alpha. “I wouldn’t want to spoil your supper.” I moaned each word as I returned the favor of leaving small nibbles down his neck. There was a knock on the door right as Alec growled and squeezed my as s hard. “Hold that the gave him a quick peck before pushing off of him. “I’m going to kill them.” Alec stood up and adjusted himself before nodding for me to open the door. “Hey!” Jasper and Emmy stood at the door with smiles on their faces.

“Congratulations! I’m so happy for you!” Opening the door, they walked in. Emmy immediately gave me a hug and Jasper shook Alec’s hand. “Thanks. I still can’t believe it.” Emmy was smiling from ear to ear. “Can we still go with you guys to eat? I am starving.” “Of course.” I said, slightly disappointed I wasn’t going to be able to torment Alec “We can still ride. It is still safe so, we are ready if you are.” Emmy smiled at Jasper. “Yeah, can you guys go ahead and get our bikes out and ready. I need to ask Kris something real quick.” Alec asked Jasper. “Of course. We will be getting it ready. mmy Alec grabbed my neck and turned me around before k*ssing me hard. His other hand went to my pants and expertly unbuttoned them as he pushed me to the couch. I was still wet so when he was able to shove them down just enough, his finger sl*pped right in. “Oh, yes, Alpha!” I moaned in his mouth. Alec showed no mercy as he turned me around and shoved me over the couch. I could hear his own pants unbuttoning before they fell to his ankles. Without warning, he shoved his di ck into me and started ramming all the S**ual tension out of him. Grabbing a fist full of hair, he pulled it back, releasing my moans. “F uck, your tight.” The pressure was building as he continued to ram it into me. “ALEC!” I screamed as my or ga sm hit and so did his. “And that… is how a baby is made.” Alec sounded very pleased with himself as he helped me stand back up. noveldrama

“You want to be a dad that bad?” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!







###Chapter 173
Chapter 0173 “Yeah, why not?” Alec smiled at me as I went to the bathroom to clean up. I wasn’t sure I was ready to be a mom but that was only because of the threats against me right now. “I’m ready.” I said as I came out. “Come here.” Alec was leaning against the couch again. This time, I stopped as I stepped between his legs and laid my head on his chest. “Tell me why you feel so unsure about being a mom.” “It’s just with the threat of this kidnapping thing and everything else, I am just worried something would happen to the baby if I am in an unsafe situation. I don’t plan to be but if I am pregnant, I can’t shift. What if a rogue knocks over our vehicle again and I have to fight a rogue in my human form?” “Well, firstly, you could be attacked by a rogue any day.” Alec tried to make it a little easier for me.” However, if it makes you feel better, we can be more safe until everything calms down.” “Thank you.” I said as I looked up at him. He gave me a small k*ss before slapping my as s.

“We better get going or they will come back up here for us.” Alec said as we stood up and headed towards the door. “However, I still could have gotten pregnant already. So, this conversation might be moot.” I looked around to make sure no one was in the stairs before I kept this conversation going. “Little Alec Jr.” Alec tasted it as it rolled off his tongue. “About that…” I laughed as as walked into the garage. “About time!” Jasper said. “Sorry. Alec had to take a s hit.” I couldn’t help but laugh at the look I could feel from him. “Guys literally poop for hours.” Emmy agreed with me as she put on her helmet. “Agreed.” I said as I blew him a k*ss and got on my bike. Alec just shook his head as he got his helmet on also.

Emmy and I took the lead as we pulled out. It felt amazing to be on the road again. The wind blowing against me as I melted into the natural curves of the road. Taking the back roads, we were able to watch the wildlife around us. It was honestly the most beautiful and peace thing on this planet. All too soon, we came up to my favorite BBQ place. Feeling rather clingy for some reason, I took Alec’s hand as we walked inside. He was slightly confused but welcomed it. Even when we had to let go to walk “Take for four?” The hostess asked. 2 “Yes, please.” Emmy answered with a smile. “Perfect. Right this way.” She grabbed a few menus and showed us to a booth in the corner. “Is this okay?” “That is perfect. Thank you.” I said as I sl*pped in. Emmy and I were on the inside and Alec and Jasper were on the outside. Alec put his hand on my inner thigh, holding it. Sl*pping my arm around his, I held on to him. Our actions didn’t go unnoticed by Emmy. She knows I am not a physical touching person so for her to see this, it was a big deal. Instead of calling me out on it, she just smiled at me and took a menu. Which, I greatly appreciated. “Mr. Alec and Ms. Kris! I’m happy you are back!” Ira walked up to us. “Thank you! Are you our waitress today?” I asked with a smile. “Sure am.” I watched her eyes land on our arms. “What can I get you guys?” “Dr. Pepper for me.” I said. “Ice tea.” Alec said. “Tea with lemon please.” Emmy answered. “Mt. Dew.” Jasper smiled nicely at her, which earned him a poke. noveldrama

“Perfect. Any appitizers?” Ira asked as if she didn’t notice the poke. “What did you give us last time?” Alec asked.







###Chapter 174
Chapter 0174 “Oh, those poppers?” “Yes, can we please get some of those?” Alec asked. “And fried pickles!” Emmy said a little loud. Her face got red as she sat back. “Of course! I’ll get that in and be right back!” As she walked off, I saw Brittany in the distance. “Look who it is.” I said and nodded towards the kitchen area. Alec followed my eye. “I’m surprised she still works here.” Alec frowned. “Why?” Emmy leaned forward, ready for the gossip. “Last time we were here, she sat beside Alec and didn’t realize who I was. Started talking a bunch of s hit before I gracefully introduced myself.” I said as I put my other hand on top of the hand that was resting on Alec’s. “I’m sorry I missed that!” Emmy laughed. I would have loved to have seen that.” “It was great. Though, I was used to people questioning why I was around Alec in the first place.” “For the record, I was always on your side.” Jasper whispered.

“Who’s else side was there?” I asked, confused. “Angela’s.” “Ah, that’s right. I forgot about her.” I nodded. “Which reminds me, I am sad the bar is closed. I could really go for some dancing.” “Ahh, I can’t drink can I?” Emmy frowned as Ira came back with our drinks. “Here you all go. Appitizers will be out shortly. Do you know what you want to order?” She looked around. “What are you going to get?” Alec asked me. “My ususal. The pu-” “Pulled pork no bun with fried okra?” Ira finished for me. “You’re good.” I nodded.

“I like to think so.” She smiled and laughed. “For you Mr. Alec?” “I’ll do the brisket with cheesy potatoes and beans.” “Okay, and you for you ma’am?” She looked at Emmy. “I’ll do the special today.” It was a half slab of ribs with fries. “Perfect and you sir?” “I’ll do the pork as well but with a bun and cheesy potatoes and beans.” “Awesome. I’ll get that right in for you.” Ira took our menus with her as she walked away. “I like her.” Emmy said. “I love her. She is amazing at her job.” “Are you guys still wanting to go swimming this afternoon?” Emmy asked us. “We can. I wasn’t sure what you guys wanted to do. If you wanted to stay in, that would be okay. I know you got some big news and if you wanted alone time, we understood.” I was giving them an out. Honestly, the pond sounded more fun than the pool. “We haven’t hung out in forever. I want to go swimming!” Emmy said with enthusiasm. “Then we will go swimming.” I said. Something about making a pregnant girl happy was satisfying. Alec was slightly annoyed but kept it hidden. “So, what are you guys plans all week. The only thing I know we have schedule is the school test thursday.” “Well, apparently, I need help with the design of the pool. We got approval for it to be done but I needed to finalize the plans.” Emmy frowned. “I’ll be happy to help you tomorrow.” I said as our appetizers came out. Emmy instant put a pickle in her mouth. Ira looked alarmed as Emmy had to spit it out because it was hot. She drank half of her tea before she could talk. “Oh no! Are you okay?” Ira looked at Emmy concerned. noveldrama

“I’m good and those are hot but so good!” The relief was clear on Ira’s face. “Oh good. Be careful. I brought some ranch for you to dip them in. That should help with the tempature of them.” “Thank you, Ira!” Emmy said with a smile as she started blowing on the pickle. “Don’t come between a pregnant woman and her food.” I mumbled as I took a pickle and gently ate it. Jasper and Alec worked on the poppers. “These are really good.” Jasper said with a mouthful. GET IT NOW







###Chapter 175
Chapter 0175 “You guys sure have quite the manners.” I joked. “There is something we need to talk to you about.” Jasper looked at Emmy. She looked panicked as she looked at him. “Here? Now?” She whispered. “It’s okay.” Jasper tried to consol her. She looked scared. “What is it?” I asked, looking between the two. “Emmy and I would like…” Jasper started. “Here is your food. Pulled pork no bun.” She set my plate in front of me. “Ribs for the lady. Pork with bun for you sir and lastly brisket.” Ira set our food in front of us. “Do you need anything else?” “I think we are good. Thank you!” I said to her. Ira walked away and I picked up my fork to start eating. Neither Alec or I asked what he wanted. Instead, they started eating. Alec glanced at me but didn’t comment. We ate in silence. Every now and then, Emmy would lift her head up but shake it before putting it back down and taking another bite.

In reality, I found it hilarious she was struggling so bad at asking me what she wanted to. I had fini first. Waiting patiently for everyone else to finish, I looked out the window. I watched as two black pulled out. Nudging Alec on the leg, I got his attention. I felt him follow my gaze as we watched Darin his gang exit the vehicles. “Emmy, are you done eating?” I asked. “Just about.” “Let me rephrase that, you are done eating. We need to leave.” I said as I looked at her. Jasper looked alarm as Alec pulled out his wallet. Tossing a hundred on the table as Darin walked in. He looked around for a second before spotting us. My back was to him but I could feel his gaze on me. noveldrama

“Well, isn’t this a pleasant surprise?” His voice sent chills down my spine. My whole b*dy cringed at his very existence. “A surprised indeed.” Alec said as he placed his hand over my legs. “We were just leaving actually.” “Oh darn, I should have came sooner. Ms. Kris. I heard your shop is about finished being remodeled?” “It is. Still have a few things to do actually. I am actually very thankful it got vandalized. This remodel is His l*p twitched in annoyance but held it still. “That’s great something good came out of something so bad. I would still like to book something with you.” “Unfortunately, it will still be a week or so before I start to schedule stuff. I have a backlog I need to finish before I book anything new. I have multiple people book out before my store was destroyed that need booked first. I’m sure you can understand.” “I see. Well, I will be waiting your call then.” Darin said. “Yes, I believe Ira is trying to seat you. If you would excuse us, we need to head out.” I said firmly. Darin looked back at Ira who was indeed waiting for him. “Very well. I’ll see you on saturday then. Save a dance for me.” He said before he allowed Alec and Jasper to slide out. Ira took them to a booth on the other side of the restaurant. We all made a quick escape but something in me told me we would run into rogues on the way home. As soon as we were outside, I pulled Alec to the side. “I’m afraid he will call in a rogue attack on us. Can we take an alternate route? It’s one thing with the four of us but with Emmy…” Alec nodded as we went back to the bikes. “Jasper, Emmy, follow us. Keep an eye out for rogues.” Alec said as we put our helmets on. Starting our bikes, we took off. Alec turned into a random street. It would completely take us out of our way but if it kept Emmy safe. “What’s that?” Emmy yelled.








###Chapter 176
Chapter 0176 “Nothing. Just keep going.” I said as we all floored it. Even with the alternate route, we made it back in two hours. No rogue attack but our nerves were shot. “Why don’t you girls get changed and meet us in the office.” Jasper k*ssed Emmy’s forehead. “Okay.” Emmy said as she ran up the stairs. “You better send warriors to scout out the route to make sure it is safe for humans.” I told Alec. “Already on it.” He nodded as he went into his office. Heading towards the bedroom, I heard some crying. Slowly, turning the corner, I saw Emmy on the ground. “Emmy? What is wrong?” I asked as I kneeled down. “I’m sorry, my hormones are all over the place. I usually am this badas s girl and lately I don’t even recognize myself.” “Honey, your pregnant. It’s okay. These things happen.” Grabbing her shoulders, I helped her stand and walked her to her room. She opened the door for us. Slowly, we walked to her bed so she could sit down. “I hate that I can’t be the person you need me to be right now.” “I don’t need you to be anyone but you. You need to focus on your baby and it’s not healthy for you to

stress this much while being pregnant. Maybe you need to take a few days off?” “You would be okay with that?” She looked at me confused. “Why wouldn’t I be?” “Jasper thought we needed to all be present and accounted for but we were hoping…” she trailed off. “Just spit it out.” I smiled at her. “That I could cut down to part time? With the baby and my hormones… and now this stress.” Emmy shook her head. “I need to get my emotions in check.” 1 agree with that but of course you can take some time off. We will still need Jasper but you can stay in

bed. Hell, you can work from your bed for all that I care. I just want this baby to be healthy.” “I love you.” Emmy said as she dried her eyes. Wrapping her arms around me, she held me tightly. “I love you too. You’re like a sister to me. I’d do anything for you.” “Will you wear the pink bat you wear the pink bathing suit?” Emmy joked. “You’re funny.” I laughed as I pulled away form her. Going to her closet, I grabbed her the skimpiest one she had. “Wear this. I am going to go change and I’ll come back and get you.” “Okay, I’ll be here.” Walking out of her room and up the stairs, I was able to make it to my room as Alec had walked through the door. “Hey.” I said jumping up behind him. “Why are you just getting here?” He asked shutting the door behind me. “Emmy had a breakdown. She wanted to ask us if she could take her workload down some. Work part time.” I said as I went to the closet and pulled out my black suit. “And you said?” Alec pulled off his shirt. “That it was okay but Jasper was still needed and if she wanted to work from her bed she could.” Alec nodded as he pulled out his swim trunks. “I agree with that.” nv sult. “Any word on the rogues?” I asked as I started pulling off my clothes to get on my “Not yet. Still looking around. Frowning, “Do you think I overreacted?” “Not even a little.” Alec grabbed two beach towels as I put on my cover. “Okay.” Alec slapped my a ss as I put on my fl*p flops.. “Ready?” I asked. “Yeah, let’s go.” Alec said as he opened the door for me. We walked down to Jasper’s and Emmy’s room. Knocking on the door, Emmy answered with a smile. “Hey, ready to go?” noveldrama

“We are.” “I had the carts pulled around.” Alec said as they walked out. “Perfect.” Jasper took Emmy’s hand and we walked down the stairs and to the golf cart that was waiting out front. It had four seats in it so we got up front and Emmy and Jasper sat in the back. Alec drove into the woods and to the pond we visited once before.







Chapter 177
Chapter 0177 “And that Emmy, is how your are suppose to drive.” I teased as we got out. She stuck her tongue out at me, making me laugh as I tossed my towel down. Sl*pping off my cover and fl*p flops, I jumped right in. I heard a splash beside me. As my head broke the surface, two more splashes echoed. “This feels amazing.” I said swimming over to Alec. He grabbed my hand and pulled me tightly against him. “It really does.” Emmy said as she hung onto Jasper as well. “Ice, I’ve been meaning to ask, how is Colt and Penny doing?” My b*dy tensed around Alec. He started rubbing my back as I turned to look at Emmy. I saw Jasper narrow his eyes but he didn’t comment. “Really good. She has struggled a little with changing into the role, I know you can understand but she is doing great.” “Yeah, it is really hard.” Emmy was oblivious to my lie. Jasper, was not. Thankfully, he didn’t call me out on it. I couldn’t tell if it was because Alec mind-linked him or just because he knew better. Either way. I was grateful. “I can be for sure. I’m excited for prom. That dress I have is killer.” Changing the subject, Alec k*ssed my cheek. He was basically holding me like you would a baby. He could touch and I could not so it was nice.

Jasper was doing the same for Emmy. “Me too. I want to dance. It’s been forever since we were able to.” “Hopefully things settle dow-” Alec’s phone started ringing. Leaving me alone, he swam to the edge and got out. “Hello?” He answered. He was quiet for a moment before answering. “Okay.” “What happened?” I asked as he sl*pped in. He walked up to me and pulled my face to his. “You were right. There was about a dozen rogues they found. Two are still alive and being brought to our cells. You save a lot of people today. Including us.” He k*ssed me hard as I melted into him.

“That’s crazy.” Emmy was in shock. “To think of what could have happened.” “Don’t. You can’t do that.” Jasper said as he pulled her around to him. They went off into their own part of the pond and we went into ours. Although we could see eachother, we ignored one another. “Oh, Alec. I can’t believe that happened.” I said as I looked into his eyes. “I’m proud of you for listening to your gut.” “Thank you. I just… I’m ready for this week to be over. However, I have a feeling things are just getting started.” I whispered as I laid my head on his chest for comfort. “Just know that I will always keep you safe.” Alec held me close for a few moments until he tilted my head up for a k*ss. It was soft at first but deepened. Soft moans met our ears from the other side of the pond. Reaching down, I wrapped my hand around his d ick. It was already hard as I started stroking it. Alec sl*pped two fingers in me as we kept k*ssing. I had to really focus on not moaning as Alec worked me. Pushing his pants down, his penis was free. Alec pulled me against him, forcing his penis in me as the moans from Emmy grew louder. was happening between Alec and I wasn’t a f uck session but more of need. We needed each other right then. Another narrow escape of death. We had so many at this point that it almost felt normal. This was different. This was saying, we are still here. We are still alive and we love each other. It was slow as he took his time with me. We looked into each other eyes as he pulled out and pushed back in. All too soon, our b*dy’s shuddered as our or gasm hit. Once again, he came deep in me. “At this rate, protection will be pointless if you don’t start pulling out.” I whispered in his ear. “Ah, I’m sorry. I can’t help it. You feel so amazing.” Alec was still deep in me. 3/2noveldrama







Chapter 178
Chapter 0178 “Is that why you are still in me.” I laughed. “Exactly Complete accident. “Liar, liar.” I said as I nibbled his ear. “I can’t wait to see you shake your as s on the dance floor.” “If I make it there.” I teased. “What do you mean?” “After you see the dress, you might not allow me to go.” “Hmm, that so?” Alec asked as he studied my face. “Yup. That is so.” “I might just rip it off you before and we won’t make it because you don’t have a dress.” “I won’t be wearing anything under it. You can f uck me before, during and after prom.” Licking his ear, his

di ck got hard in me. I felt my walls tight with his growth. Alec’s phone rang again. “Hmm.” Looking back, he debated if he wanted to answer it or not. “Just go.” I sighed. “It might be important.” hee Alec groaned as he pulled out of me and adjusted his pants. However, he was still hard when he exited the water. I watched his b*dy as he stood up from answering the phone. Water dripped down each curve of the muscles that framed him. The tattoo had turned out amazing. It looked like the wolf was staring right at me. Each time he flexed, it looked like the wolf moving. I was truly good at my art. “Time to go.” Alec said in a very authoritative voice. “What’s going on?” Jasper asked, his voice was still full of lust. “They found something in the cell phone.” “I thought they linked it to a building in the city? Jasper asked as the they started swimming over to the noveldrama

edge. “They did but I guess there is more now. Come on, we need to go.” Alec grabbed a towel and started drying off. Jasper and Emmy got out first and then I was able to sl*p out. Alec handed me my towel as he picked everything up. Tossing me my shoes, he carried my cover to the cart. His whole demeanor had “What aren’t you telling us?”! asked in the mind-link. “They found pictures too.” “Of?” “Us. The night we got shot at. We messed around in the store. There are pictures of us from then and there are even pictures of us from yesterday.” We were in the cart as Alec drove clearly pi ssed off. My head snapped to him as he finished his sentence. “You-you mean I am being followed? I am being photographed in my own pack?” My jaw dropped. Alec didn’t respond but his knuckles got white on the steering wheel. Pure anger rolled off him as we pulled up to the packhouse. Jasper was instantly aware and his mood shifted to fit Alec’s. He didn’t need to know the reason to become protective. “Emmy, why don’t you go to our room and shower?” She looked between the men and then finally at me. “Ice?” “For the sake of not stressing you out, please?” “Something happened.” She concluded. “I’ll tell you later.” I promised. She took a deep breath and put a hand on her stomach. “Okay.” Grabbing her stuff, she went to their room and we went to Alpha Marc’s office. “What the F UCK?” Alec roared as he busted the door open. “Look for yourself.” Alpha Marc pointed to his computer. He was standing off to the side, not looking at them. I was thankful for that. Nothing like your father-in-law looking at you f ucking his son. Following Alec, I watched as he shifted between pictures. Sure enough, there was us in front of the mirror in my shop. Then as we saw my shop after being destroyed. Next was when I was walking just outside the

packhouse. “Go back.” I said. Alec did as I asked. It was a simple picture of me sitting at the pool with Emmy. It was clearly from a higher view point. “Go to the next one.”









###Chapter 179
Chapter 0179 It was a picture of Alec and I walking. “That was just outside the packhouse. Remember? We went for a random walk.” Alec said. I remember it. It was only a few minutes but to get from fresh air. It was after we watched that movie. Colt had me sign the last will and testament. I had wanted to walk a little before bed. “The view point is from above. All of these are that way.” I said to everyone. “And zoomed in?” Alpha Marc said. Wed don’t have any buildings that tall that would fit that angle for some of these photos. Like that one with me at the pool. There is no buildings anywhere close in that angle that would create that shot.” “What are you thinking?” Alec asked in a very restraint anger. “Like a drone or something. This could have been a screen shot.”

“A drone can be powered from miles away.” Alec almost yelled. Putting my hand on his shoulder, I tried to calm him a little. “Meaning, it doesn’t have to be someone from out pack. It could be someone in a tree, just outside of our territory. “How did you get these?” Alec turned to look at his dad. “They got them from the phone. This phone didn’t take them but someone sent them to this phone. It was password and cryptid but we got it opened.” all “Did you get anything else?” I asked. “The phone is linked to that business. The number that sent the phones is also from the samenoveldrama

business.” Alpha Marc crossed his arms. “What can we do about a f ucking flying drone?” Alec stood up so quick that it knocked me over. Thankfully the desk and Alpha Marc caught me before I fell down. Alec, however, took the chair and threw it out the closed window. “ALEC!” Alpha Marc yelled. “I got it.” I told Alpha Marc. “Alec. Come on.” Grabbing his hand, I pulled him out of the office and walked up to our bedroom. His b*dy was shaking with anger as he started picking s hit up and throwing it around the room. “HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO KEEP YOU SAFE WHEN THE F UCKING SKY IS THE ONE SPYING ON YOU?” Alec was seriously losing his s hit. The couch got turned upside down, the arm chair was on the balcony and the dresser was laying on the floor. However, I just let him go at it until he threw something that hit one of the pictures I drew that he framed. “ENOUGH!” I yelled. Alee was leaning against the wall, breathing heavily. He didn’t respond but he looked at him. His eyes were full of anger. “Do you feel better now our entire room is destroyed?” “No.” His knuckles were white as he kept them balled up. “Let me think. We can come up with a plan that will be fitting.” I didn’t make any move to touch him. “F F UUCCKK!” Alee growled as the bedroom door opened and Jasper walked in. He looked around before looking at me for any injuries before turning his attention to Alec. “Missed a spot.” He said as he sat down on the edge of the bed. “F uck off, Jasper.” Alec rolled his eyes and started pacing. “We wil-” I started. “WHAT’S THE F UCKING PLAN THEN?” Alec turned and yelled at me. He was seriously losing his s hit.

“Maybe you need to go for a run. Let your wolf out and go kill something.” Jasper had stood up and moved over to me like he was going to protect me. “Come on. I’ll run with you.” Alec’s anger was reaching a boiling point as Jasper grabbed his arm and pulling him towards the door. Alec ripped his arm out of Jasper’s reach and took off running out the balcony. “NO!” I yelled as Alec jump off and shifted midair. Landing perfectly on his paws, he took off running. “You better get going, Jasper.” I said quietly. A second later, our bedroom door slammed against the wall. Half jogging to Alpha Marc’s office, I barged in without knocked. No one was there. I couldn’t mind link anyone. Running straight to Emmy’s room, I busted down the door to get in.







###Chapter 180
Chapter 0180 “What the hell?” Emmy bolted up from her bed. “Mind-link Alpha Marc. Tell him I need him. It’s an emergency.” Emmy closed her eyes and did exactly. what I asked without question. “He is in the kitchen.” Without even explaining, I ran down to the kitchen and met him in the hall. “You need to issue an emergency cover order or whatever you have here. Alec hasn’t calmed down yet and his wolf took off. Jasper went after him but people should not be out right now. Have the warriors ready.” “F uck. He hasn’t lost control like this in a long time.” Alpha Marc went to his office. “We will need to track him down. Your wolf is going to need to find him if Jasper hasn’t already.” “I can’t f ucking mind-link anyone and Alec’s is blocked.” “Alright. Denounce your ties. Right now.” Alpha Marc looked at me and puffed his chest. I was so caught off guard that it took me a minute to do it. noveldrama

A sharp pain of sadness shot through my heart but it was the right thing. 1, Kristen Jefferys, future luna of the Black Moon Pack, denounce my ties to the Blue Fang pack.” It was like a knife was stabbed in my stomach, making me bend over in pain. My eyes filled with water but I kept repeating I was doing this for Alec. “I, Marc Andrews, Alpha of the Black Moon Pack, accept Kristen Jefferys as a member of my pack and as the future luna.” Alpha Marc said quickly. “I, Kristen Jefferys, accept my position a member of the Black Moon Pack and as their future Luna.” Instant pounding filled my head. So many voiced covered every inch that I could barely function. “Good, Let’s go.” Alpha Marc grabbed my arm and pulled me along with him. The light was blinding as I

tried to clear my head as much as possible. “Shift.” He said as I heard his bones break. “Sierra.” I called in my mind through all the voices that were trying to mind-link me. She came forward and pushed me back as she shifted. I only caught bits and pieces of everything as I tried to focus on pushing all the voices back. I saw some warriors looking around at someone. Alpha Marc had slowed to a walking pace but next thing I saw was Alec’s wolf. He wasn’t backing down. “Alec.” I mind-linked him. “Why are you in pain?” Alec asked in extreme restrain anger. “I denounced my ties and joined the pack. My head is overflowed with voices right now. You need to calm down.” I caught a glimpse of Sierra walking in front of Alpha Marc and going up to Alec’s wolf. He was angry but he knew she was his mate and therefore the only person that could get close to him right ΠΟΥ, “You what?” His wolf looked into Sierra’s eyes. I couldn’t read his expression very well. “How are you still awake?” “You needed me.” I said as I continued to fight the pain. “You didn’t need to do that.” “Alec. You jumped out the window. I couldn’t reach anyone. I couldn’t mind-link anyone. You were blocking me until right now. I had to go find Emmy to link your dad because he wasn’t in his office.” “You did this because of me?” “Please calm down and tell everyone to go away.” I couldn’t take it and I just wanted to shift back and pass out. Black spots were dancing in my vision, Alec’s wolf howled loudly as his demeanor changed. After a few seconds, I caught a glimpse of Alec in his human form. “I’m good. You can leave now.” He walked up to Sierra. She had laid down and started whimpering. “Is she okay?”

“Is she okay?” I heard Jasper ask. “She denounced her ties and is now officially a pack member. She needs to pass out but refuses to let go until I was calmed down. Everyone needs to leave so she can shift back.” “You heard the man, Luna needs some privacy.” All I could hear was footsteps as they left. Alec was still full of anger but he had finally refocused himself. GET IT NOW






###Chapter 181
Chapter 0181 “You can shift back now. I have a shirt for you.” Alec said, trying to coax me into shifting. It worked as Sierra went back into my mind to avoid the pain we were feeling. I knew I was back when the dry dirt went into my nose and caused me to sneeze. “Ow.” I cried as Alec put a shirt over me and I felt some shorts being pulled on. “I’m so sorry. I can’t believe you did that without me there. You knew that was going to be painful. It pis ses me off I am the reason this happened.” I “You’re dad sprung it on me. Can I sleep now?” I said as the black spots were winning. “Yes, sleep my love. I got you.” I heard him whisper before I felt a k*ss to my forehead, then blackness. Alec’s POV I just sat down beside my passed out mate. I was so f ucking pi ssed off that my wolf took over. It wasn’t

until my wolf saw his mate that he even started calming down. When he realized she was in pain, his anger became guilt. I don’t know how many times at this point that her not being able to mind-link anyone had been a disadvantage but the fact dad had her do it without me there, pis ses me off. Jasper left me his phone before he left. I needed to call Colt and tell him what was going on. I hated putting more on his plate but he was our best ally at this point. Finding Colt’s number, I hit call. It only rang twice before he picked up. “Jasper?” “No, it’s me.” I said with a sigh. “Alec, what’s wrong? Where is your phone?” Colt was instantly alert. “My phone is probably broken somewhere. I don’t actually know. Listen, I don’t have good news.” “Is Kristen okay?”

“Yeah, she is fine.” Standing up, I started pacing. “What’s going on?” Colt asked. “We finally broke through the phone…” Colt waited a beat before talking. “…and?” “And it’s f ucking bad. The phone is linked to the same building in the city but what is bad is there are a few days ago from the my territory.” “WHAT?” Colt yelled. “Kristen thinks, due to the angle, they were taken from a distance and up high. She thinks a drone has been flying over and taking a video and screen shots are being sent to the phone.” “Why were they being sent to the phone?” Colt asked. His voice was full of anger. “Probably so the rogues could identify her.” I felt like a failure just saying it. “What is the plan for this?” Colt asked. “We don’t have one yet. I lost control and just now calmed down.” “Is that why she denounced her ties?” “Yeah. On more than one occasion it has been an issue she can’t mind-link anyone here for help or whatever.” “I’m assuming she is passed out now?” “Yup.” “How the f uck are we going to stop a f ucking drone?” Colt asked. “No idea. Kristen thinks they have to be within a mile or two of it for it to work. Send scouts out to they can find anyone. Shoot it down when we find it.” : “It’s not like she will stay inside. We are already taking away her shop. Not like we can open the bar u either until this is done.” Colt was thinking out loud. “It’s getting dark. This is going to be a long f ucking week. A buzz caught my attention. Looking up, I saw a little bee fly around my head before it exploded right in front of my face. “The f u ck?” The smoke went into noveldrama

my nose. “Alec?” “F uck, Colt, hellll” the world started spinning before it went black.






###Chapter 182
Chapter 0182 Kristen POV “Wakey wakey.” A splash of colt water hit my face, forcing me to focus. My stomach was rolling, threatening to spill every ounce of food I had digested. Pain ripped through my shoulder and ankles. My head was pounding so bad that I couldn’t understand why Alec would leave me in the forest. “Alec?” I groaned as my mouth filled with saliva. “Oh no, I am much better.” A voice I wished I never would hear again invaded my ears. My b*dy instantly tensed as I forced my eyes open. Everything was spinning, making me lose my battle. Leaning to the side, my stomach emptied it self. “Yeah, that can happen. Side effect I’m afraid.” “Side effects… of what?” I asked between dry heaves.

“Oh, well, if I told you that I would have to kill you.” Darin laughed. Focusing on my breathing, I tried to level it out before slowly peaking my eyes open. My head was heavy as I rolled from side to side. I could tell I was sitting up. Something tied my wrist and ankles together but I still had clothes on. Someone firmly grabbed my chin and pulled my face up before pressing their l*ps against me. As hard tried to resist, he tried to stick is tongue in my mouth. Panic set in as I realized what was happening. worst fear had some true. As soon as his tongue touched mine, I bit down as hard as I could. Thankful he instantly let go of me but a sharp pain shot across my face. I felt the blood drip from my mouth and above my eye. “You stu pid bi tch” Darin yelled. My vision was starting to come around. I saw him holding his mouth as

blood trickled down his chin. He was looking at me with anger and lust. “I am going to have fun f ucking that attitude out of you. I’ll make you submit.” He took a step towards me when someone yelled at him. “DARINI” Darin instantly stopped moved but his eyes never left me. “I apologize for my son. He gets impatient sometimes.” Alpha Rip walked in. He was an older vision of Darin but much less hair. Fear gripped me but I tried to hide it as much as possible. “Sometimes?” I said as I spit out a wa d of blood. “I do like your fire.” Alpha Rip walked more into the light. “What do you want with me?” I asked. I was proud of myself for how steady my voice was. “I, personally, don’t want anything. My son would like you to reject Alec and mate with him.” “I’ll die before that happens.” Alpha Rip got an evil smile on his face. “We will see about that.” He said before he slapped Darin on the chest and they all walked out. The metal door slammed shut before I heard some locks. “F uck.” I whispered to myself. Looking around, I started figuring out where I was. A big as s fan was slowly moving above me. A little light was shinning from it otherwise I was in a massive room. Like it was a store that has been vacant for years now. No shelves but there was columns around. Everything was coated in inches of dust. The windows were so dirty that you couldn’t even see out of them. It was only me, this chair and a f ucking drain under me. Chains were hanging from the ceiling that I refused to think about. Either way, I knew I wasn’t going to get out of this unscathed. I wasn’t sure how much time had passed. Darkness had fallen over the windows and eventually massive rats started peaking out from behind the walls. My stomach was still extremely upset, I had to pee and it was getting harder and harder to hold up my head. The chair wasn’t attached to the floor but I knew that if I tipped it over, it would be easier access for the rats. Since my ankles were tied to the chair, it wasn’t noveldrama

like I could just stand up and walk out. GET IT NOW






###Chapter 183
Chapter 0183 However, I tried a couple time to scoot the chair across the floor. All it did for me was make the back leg I get stuck on the drain. I was afraid if I tried anymore, I would tip over. I tried mind-linking anyone and got no response. I tried calling Sierra and she was gone. Whatever they gave me, had wolfsbane in it. Whoever invited or found that f ucking poison could go to hell. Eventually, exhaustion won over and I passed out again. The sound of the metal door snapped me out of my sleep. The hardest thing I have ever done was in that moment. Picking my head up from being fulled laid back was pure white hot pain. A small girl walked in and a warrior style guy was behind her with a gun in his hands. “1-I brought you food and I’ll let you pee. If you run, he will shoot you and me.” She said as she came forward. She looked to be barely twelve years old but her b*dy was covered in bruises, or what I could see. She was wearing what looked like a potato sack. I didn’t respond as she unlocked the chains that were around me. As soon as my arms and ankles were free, I immediately fell to the ground.

“Oh, f uck…” I groaned. “Bathroom is this way.” She said as she walked away from me. The first time I tried to stand, I fell on my hands and knees. My arms gave out and I went down face first into the dirt. The second time, I was able to get my feet under me but it took the girl coming back and helping me stand before I was able to limp to the bathroom. There was no door but at this point, I didn’t give a f uck. The toilet looked like it hadn’t been clea years, spiders had webs acrossed it and there was rat poop on the seat. Hovering as best I could, I finally able to pee. It felt so good to finally go but my legs protested the entire time. “HURRY UP!” The guard yelled when I was mid-stream. It wasn’t like I could stop it midway so I just

kept going. However, I was pulling up my shorts when he walked in. “I’m done.” I said sarcastically. “St upid b itch!” He back handed me so hard that my head bounced off the wall. Falling to the ground, it was hard to not pass out. However, when I looked up and his fist was coming to my face, there wasn’t any fighting passing out now. “What the f uck happened to her?” I heard as my senses were starting to come back to me. There was a few grunts but all I could focus on was the pain in my head. The voices sound so far away. Someone put their hand on my shoulder and shook me. “Wake up.” Alpha Rip’s voice pulled me from my sleep. I could only open one eye but what I saw surprised me. was back the chair How? I had no idea but the g it had a fresh truise on her chen the was witing in thont of me shaking The guard that beat me was standing to the side with a b loody mode and “How touched you? Alpha Rip asked me 1 That piece of f ucking s hit “I said as I looked at the guard I wasn’t sure what I was expecting but watched as Darin raised a gun to his temple and fired it. The guard dropped dead in front of me. The le girl tried not to scream but a little one sl*pped out “What are we going to do now? Dann asked “The same thing we were going to do before Alpha Rasked as he started setting something up “With her face like that?” ” “It’s fine Alpha Rip waved him off Whatever they were planning my apparently bruised face was not part of the plannoveldrama







###Chapter 184
Chapter 0184 “This isn’t going to go well. She doesn’t have her wolf so it won’t heal very quickly.” “Fine. We can give her the liquid and do this tomorrow.” Alpha Rip sighed. “Did you bring it?” “Well, no.” “Then f ucking go get it!” Alpha Rip yelled. Darin walked out of the room. A car engine sounded before he drove away. “You are lucky I have a heart. I need you half way presentable for this video.” “Why?” “They will pay good money for you but sadly, you will never make it home. I have a perfect room set up for you so you can keep my son company.” I didn’t even have a chance to digest what he said before my stomach emptied what little bit of stomach acid was in there. Just the thought of him touching me was more than I could handle. My b*dy couldn’t even hide how f ucking scared I was as it shook. The sound of an engine coming closer caused me to panic more. Just having Darin close to me was

sickening. The girl kept her head down as Alpha Rip kept working with whatever he was working on. “Got it.” Darin said as he walked in. “Great.” Alpha Rip said sarcastically. Anger filled me as he got closer and closer. I wasn’t done fighting.. might be scared as s hit but I sure as hell wasn’t going to lay down and take it. Darin walked up to the girl and kicked her. “Give this to her.” She instantly stood up and took it. “What is it?” I asked. “It’s a healing tea. It will help your eye not look so bad.” Darin crossed his arms. “And if I don’t take it?” I said in defiance. “Then I will kill her.” Darin took his gun out and shoved it against her head. Her eyes looked at me and pleaded.

“Fine.” Relief was clear as she held the tea up to my l*ps before slowly pouring it in. It was cold as it slid down my throat and tasted rather bitter. I ended up choking a little since it had been so long since I drank anything. “I changed my mind. We will shoot it now.” Alpha Rip said as he stood up. Why go get it then: Darin looked pis sed. “Shut up.” Alpha Rip looked at Darin and pushed him back. Turning to look at me, he crossed his arms. “Now, listen here. We are making a video. I have a script you will say. If you do not obey, I will shoot her in the foot.” He pointed a the girl. “Then, I will restart the video and try again. Each time you fail to say exactly what I want you to, she will get shot.” My heart was racing. There was only so much I could say before a sacrifice would be needed. “What are you wanting me to say?” “You will say that…. well…” Alpha Rip looked at me and frowned. “Yeah? what exactly should she say?” Darin looked at his dad. “You were suppose to say you left on your own free will but since you only can see out of one eye, we need to change it up.” Alpha Rip sighed. “Does it really matter what I say if I’m not going to be let go?” The tea was really upsetting my stomach. It was already upset but this was different. “I guess not.” Alpha Rip said. “On second thought, maybe a video isn’t a good idea. We will just leave you here until you break and then we can take you back to the packhouse where you will start your new life.” “I won’t make it there.” I said. noveldrama

“We will see about that.” Alpha Rip said with an evil smile. “Everyone has a breaking point.” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! 






###Chapter 185
Chapter 0185 I wasn’t sure how much time had passed. After Alpha Rip and Darin left the room, I haven’t seen them. since. Twice it became dark and the sun rose but I was so out of it that I barely knew if I was awake or asleep. Q uicker than I expected, I could see out of both eyes. It was in time for a flash of light to illuminate the dark room. Thunder rolled as the smell of rain drifted in. “Good evening, beautiful.” Darin’s voice scared the s hit out of me. I didn’t hear any vehicles coming. Not sure if the storm drowned them out but since he was dry, I assumed he was in one. “What do you want?” I asked as I tried to focus. My heart started beating rapidly as he got closer and closer to me. 1 have a surprise for you.” Darin was smiling as he straddled me on the chair. His hands painfully gripped my breast before he forced me to look at him. “Get off!” I tried to yell but he k*ssed me again. This time, he kept his tongue to himself. “F uck, I am going to enjoy f ucking you.” He got off me as my eyes filled with tears. My entire b*dy was noveldrama

shaking in fear but I tried to hide it. The door opened again and three warriors drug in someone that was unconscious. The only light was from a lantern that Darin had placed in front of me so it wasn’t until they tied the man up and pushe in front of me that I saw who it was. “No!” I whispered. Alec was sitting in front of me, covered in blood. “Oh ve yes.” Darin gloated. “My guards were able to find him and bring him to me.” “Your guards? Found him and brought him to you?” I asked. As hard as I tired, I still couldn’t mind-link him. “Yes, my sweet s exy girl. I am the superior man.”

“Alec?” I tried to see if he was awake. His head was hung forward but he didn’t move. “He might be out for a little bit. Until then, we will be right back.” Darin laughed as he and the guards walked out. Again, I didn’t hear any engine but after an hour, no one came back and Alec didn’t move. “Alec, please wake up.” I whimpered. He didn’t answer. It took about an hour or so longer before he started groaning. “Alec!” I cried again. His face looked up as he smiled. “F uck, it worked.” He gave a small chuckle, “What worked?” I asked. “I had a hunch that Darin took you and he would want you to reject me. In order to reject me, you have to see me. I knew if I got caught, he would bring me to you.” “How does that help with saving me?” I asked. “I swallowed a tracker before I left.” “So, help is coming?” I asked as a ray of hope filled me. “Yes, my love. Help is coming. Are you okay?” “No.” I couldn’t stop the flow of tears that ran down my face. “Isn’t this nice. The two love birds are getting acquainted again.” Darin’s voice sent fear down my spine. “Stay strong.” Alec whispered to me. “Isn’t she lovely?” Darin walked up behind me. Wrapping his arm across my throat, he started to choke me. “Leave her alone.” Alec said in pure anger. I “This beautiful face?” Letting go of my throat, he grabbed my cheeks again. “Maybe I should mov His hand under my shirt My heart started racing and I did the only thing I could think my head down and snapping it back with everything I had. Head-butting him right in the nose. “F UCKING B ITCH!” Darin stood up before coming around and back handing me across the face. “DON’T TOUCH HER!” Alec yelled. Darin turned around and landed a punch to Alec’s gut. It caused him to

instantly puke. “What’s that?” There was an obvious ting as something fell against the floor. Picking it up, he looked at it before realization dawned on him. “I think you have about thirty seconds before this place is crawling with my men.” Alec said with a smile. on his face.






###Chapter 186
Chapter 0186 Darin ran to the window before coming back to me. “This isn’t over. I will be waiting for you. Right when you think you are safe, I will get you.” He whispered before running out of the building. He wasn’t wrong. Just a few seconds later, flash bombs went off before men came in from d In from different directions. My eyes were on Alec as all the adrenaline crashed. My chains started shaking, instantly making me jump. “Don’t touch her!” Alec commanded. We were surrounded by men in tactical gear. Everything just stopped as someone kneeled in front of me. “Luna. It’s me, Jasper. Can I unlock the chains?” My eyes were too full of water to see him clearly. “Unlock me first.” Alec said. Jasper must have gotten us and moved over to Alec. I tried to blink a few times to get the tears gone. “Alpha…” “I’m fine.” Alec said. “Kristen, I am going to untie you.” Alec said before I felt the chains move. “Alec, her shoulders are out of place.” I heard Jasper say. He tried to be quiet but wolves had excellent hearing. Everyone here knew.

“Dam n.” Alec said as the chains fell but my shoulders didn’t move. “I’m sorry, this is going to hurt.” “Same time.” I said. “What?” Alec asked. “Do t them both at the same time.” My tears had dried and was replaced by anger. “Luna.. ar-” Jasper started. “Do it, Jasper.” I said as my eyes landed on him. He frowned but nodded. Kneeling down, he got in position. “I need to touch you to do it.” Nodding, Alec and Jasper put their hands on my shoulder and my arm..

“1. 2. SNAP!” “F UCK!” I yelled as feeling came back into my arms. They gently got pulled around before Alec took some wrap and secured them against my b*dy.. “Is anything else out?” Alec asked. “No.” I answered as my head swam. “Don’t fight it, just pass out.” Jasper said to me. “Not until I am home.” “Kristen, you ne-” I “NO! Don’t you f ucking get it? Last time I passed out, I woke up here. No, I am staying away until I feel safe.” Alec tried to stand up but winced and fell back down. “D amn.” He placed his hand over his side. “Broke a rib.” Alec gritted his teeth before standing up. Grabbing my shoulders, he helped me stand up. “Where is Colt?” I asked. “Watching the pack.” Jasper said beside me. “How did you get him to stay home?” “It wasn’t easy.” Cold rain hit me in the face as we walked outside. Wind whipped at my hair but the sight of our vehicles and men surrounding it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. My b*dy was shaking, not from being cold but from everything that has happened to me.. “What day is it?” I asked as Jasper opened the door. “Thursday.” Alec helped me get in before he sl*pped in beside me. Someone was already behind th wheel as Jasper got in the passenger side. “Is it set up?” Alec asked. “Ready when you are.” Jasper answered.

“Is what ready?” I asked. “This building you were in, that is the same one that the phone was linked to. Obviously it isn’t a business anymore so we are leveling it. However, we moved up the time frame on the other project. As soon as you get home, we are moving forward with the garage and not waiting till saturday.” Alec said as the driver peeled out. We were on the interstate and headed home. I knew Alec was uncomfortable but he didn’t take his arm off of me. I was incredibly thankful but also worried I was hurting him. “Can I lay down?” I asked. My stomach was really sour. Alec nodded as he helped me move to lay down. My head was on his thigh and my legs were propped up. Alec put his arm back around my, holding my waist against him.noveldrama






###Chapter 187
Chapter 0187 “It’s okay.” I tried to sit up but couldn’t. Alec had to help me sit up as I moved to the middle seat. He wrapped his arms around me and buried his head in my neck for a moment before leaning back. “Whenever you are ready.” Jasper sald and hit record on a tape recorder. Setting it on the center consol, it was all I could do but stare at it. “I woke up chained to that chair. Basically, Alpha Rip and Darin kidnapped me. Darin….” I closed my eyes as I tried to keep my voice level as I told my store. “Anyway, I got slapped before they left. I’m not sure how long it was before a guard or warrior came with a small girl. She looked to be in her early teens but she wore a potato sack. She helped me use the bathroom but when I took too long, the guard came in and beat me up.” Alec’s fist balled up before he firmly gripped the seat. “I woke up some time later and Alpha Rip and Darin were there with the girl and the guard. After they found out what happened, Darin noveldrama

shot the guard in the head.” “Good.” Alec muttered. “I couldn’t see out of my eye. Alpha Rip was setting up what I think was a video camera. He wanted me to make a video. He said that if I didn’t do it correctly or messed up intentionally, he was going to shoot the girl in the foot and work his way up until I did it correctly. However, since my face was swollen, that scrapped that plan.” “What was the video for? Jasper asked, quietly. “He wanted me to make a video of me saying I was leaving you and not to look for me. Darin wanted to wait and give me some drink to help me heal. When he left to go get it, Alpha Rip said they had a secret room for me to live in and be Darin’s se xy toy. He-he said I would never get out and that would be my life.” I saw the driver’s knuckles get white on the steering wheel. “I’m sorry but we have to know…” Jasper closed his eyes before opening them and looking at me.

“Did… did he touch you?” “Nothing below the waist.” I said finally, trying to find the right words. Looking away from Alec in shame, I tried not to cry again. “Hey.” Alec touched my chin gently as Jasper turned off the recording. “Look at me.” I didn’t want to but I listened. “I’m so sorry I wasn’t strong enough to stop him.” “You have nothing to be sorry for. He will pay for this.” Alec k*ssed my forehead before Jasper hit play again. “Is there anything else?” He asked. “I don’t think so. My face messed up either plans so I have no idea what was suppose to happen.” Jasper nodded before shutting off the recording again. “I’m sorry, Kristen.” Jasper said to me. “What happened?” I asked, ignoring him. “How did I get kidnapped from the center of our territory?” “After you passed out, I called Colt to tell him what happened. A little bee looking thing flew in front of my face and blew up. I breathed in the smoke and I was knocked out.” “He was on the phone with Colt so when it happened, Colt called the office and we rushed out to him. Thankfully, we were able to get Alec medical attention but it was a couple hours before we realized that you were not where you were suppose to be. We assumed Alec had carried you to your room after you passed out. We looked at the cameras but nothing was there. It wasn’t until Alec came around that he realized you were kidnapped.” Jasper filled me in. “But how?” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!






###Chapter 188
Chapter 0188 “Angela.” Alec growled. “What? How?” “Remember I sent her to the cells to work? Well, there is an underground tunnel we build to use as an escape route. She let Darin in through the tunnels to kidnap you, thinking I would take her back.” “The f uck?” I asked as I tried to wrap my head around what I just heard. “Obviously the tunnels were permanently closed and Angela is secured. However, we weren’t sure where to find you.” Jasper continued. “I decided to use myself as bait. It was a very unpopular opinion but I did it anyway. Swallowing the I tracker, I allowed myself to get kidnapped. Thinking they would take me to you so we could reject each. other.” “I still don’t get why? He would have violated me regardless if we were mates or not.” “If you guys were mates, your b*dy would respond to his, even if your head didn’t want it.” Jasper said for

Alec. That made me shrink up against Alec a little more. “S hi t.” I heard Jasper whisper. “What?” I asked, not sure I could handle any bad news. “It’s Emmy calling again. “Just answer it.” I said. “Emmy, baby girl. You h-” “Did you find Kristen?” She interrupted him. He looked and me and I nodded. Holding it up to me, I spoke to her. “Hey girl. I am safe.” “Holy f uck, I can’t tell you how happy I am to hear your voice.” Emmy cried. “I really am okay. You need to go to sleep. You can come visit me tomorrow, okay?”

“Okay, Colt is here.” “Kristen.” He said in a sigh of relief. “Colt.” I didn’t say anything and neither did he. We just let the silence talk for us. “I’ll see you soon.” He said, finally. “Okay.” Nodding to Jasper, he hung up the phone. “Seriously! That was weird between you and Colt.” “No it wasn’t. He was happy I was safe.” Alec helped me lay back down. “I’ll never get used to it.” Jasper mumbled, making me smile. drifted off t I wasn’t sure when I next thing I knew, the door to the SUV was opening. Someone pulled me out and placed me on something that wheeled me along. My eyes were barely wanting to open but ! aware of all the bright lights and hands that were touching me. was “No!” I screamed as I tried to force myself to wake up. All I could imagine was Darin trying to touch me again. “EVERYONE STOP!” I heard Alec command. All the hands went off me instantly. “She was just kidnapped and…” His voice trailed off. “Don’t just f ucking touch her.” “Alec.” I whimpered. “Talk to me.” I “It’s too bright.” I said as I tried to move against him. A second later, the lights went off and I was finally able to open my eyes. Alec was beside me, people in scrubs were standing around and final! landed on Colt. We locked together as my b*dy started trembling against. “Shh, it’s okay. These are doctors. They take a look at your shoulders and your ankles. Are you hurt anywhere else?” Colt asked me. “N-no.” I whispered. “We are going to step out and le-” Colt started. noveldrama

“NO!” I looked panicked between him and Alec. “Please stay with me?” I asked. “We aren’t going anywhere.” Alec leaned down and k*ssed my forehead. It helped me relax. “No men.” I said looking at the doctors. They didn’t even argue as they all turned and left. Only the females were left beside Colt and Alec. “Can they look at you now?” Alec asked. I couldn’t even answer. Instead, I just nodded yes. Colt walked over to the door and stood there, almost like he was guarding it and Alec stood behind me. Two girls came to stand on either side of me.







###Chapter 189
Chapter 0189 Nodding yes, she slowly and barely touched me as started unwrapping it. “We need to cut off your shirt.” Amy said showing me the scissors. Again, I nodded and they went to my back and cut up to my neck and down each arm. However, they didn’t just remove it. After pushing on my pack and sides, they kept the shirt covering my breast and tied it in the back so I wasn’t exposed. I was so thankful for that. Not. because I was worried about Colt seeing my breast, but I already felt exposed enough. “We are going to assess your shoulders, neck and face now.” Katrina said as they started feeling around. “We will need an radiograph of each shoulder and of her face.” Katrina told Amy. Amy nodded as she went to the closet and pulled out a machine. “What are you doing?” Alec asked. “We need an x-ray of her shoulders and face to make sure nothing is broken.” Katina said to him. He nodded in response. “However, Luna Kristen, we need to lay you down flat. Is that okay?” Nodding, I moved so I was resting against the bed. Lowering me down, she moved the machine over me.”

This is the x-ray machine. A light will come on here and after a little beep, we are done with the one.” Amy explained. They all stepped back as the machine turned on just like she said it would. My panic was starting to fade a little as Alec pushed more relaxation and calm into me. As soon as one picture was taken, they moved the machine to the other shoulder before moving it over my face. Tilting my face gently, I closed my eyes as the light appeared for a third time. “Her shoulders aren’t broken but she has a broken jaw. It appears to be setting already and is in place

so no need to worry about that. Your shoulders need to be reset correctly. I know you did it once but they aren’t fully in correct position.” A nurse said to me and d to Alec. “Can you numb her first?” Colt asked. “No. No numbing. I need to feel the pain right now.” I said firmly. “Are you sure?” Alec asked as he walked around and looked me in the eyes. “Yes, I am.” He nodded and climbed on the bed. Alec was straddling me as the nurses came around to each arm. “On the count of three.” The one nurse said. “No. Just do it.” I said as I closed my eyes. Each nurse took an arm and bent it before yanking on it “They should feel better.” They moved each arm over my stomach and started wrapping my shoulder in a skin. bandage. She had to take my shirt completely off so my arm were against my “It does.” “Can I give you a shot of pain meds?” A nurse asked. I still hadn’t opened my eyes. “Yes.” I felt her walk away. Alec had his hands on my legs. Th e sparks were helping keep me calm. “Here is a pinch.” They always say pinch but it is more like a f ucking bee sting on steroids. However, a few seconds later, the pain was fading. “You can take her home. Keep her in bed tomorrow. She should get her wolf back by then and then healing should be quickly.” The other nurse said, I could hear her taking off her gloves. “Obviously, call us if you need anything.” They said and walked out of the room. I felt Alec get off the bed and someone went over my head. He had put his t-shirt over me to keep me covered as we left. Carefully, he picked me up and carried me. The pain meds were helping as my eyes started dropping. “Go to sleep, love.” He whispered to me. I felt the wind on my face before I gave in. Alec POV

As soon as she was asleep, I allowed myself to feel all the anger I had suppressed in order to get her though this. Just seeing her in that position, bl oo dy and bruised was more than I could handle right n It took everything in me to make it to my room. Emmy was waiting for us. As I laid her down, Emmy curled up next to her and kept her company.noveldrama







###Chapter 190
Chapter 0190 The guys followed me out of the bedroom and down to the weight room. Only one man would be able to handle me right now. I didn’t even have to ask Colt to fight. He took his shirt off as the other guys circled around us. My face was already b loody but I needed to feel the pain. Colt didn’t go easy on me and I didn’t go easy on him. We battled all of our frustrations, all of our anger and feelings of hopelessness. He was the only other man that loved that woman half as much as I did. It was a different love for him but still a strong one. I wasn’t sure how long we fought but neither of us won. I was even more bl oody than I was before but it would all be cleared up by tomorrow or the next day. Colt and I hugged it out as we grabbed our shirts. Not a single man said a word. Instead, we all went to our rooms. Jasper came and got Emmy as I got in the shower. The water turned brown and burned but it was only a fraction of the pain I felt Kristen go through. The fact she didn’t want to be numb was something I’ll never understand. She had been through so much that I would think she would want the pain to go away. Maybe she felt like

the pain kept everything real? I can’t even imagine how she felt sitting in that room and going through the motions. My fist balled up as I tried not to punch the wall. I failed her. I didn’t protect her and her literal worst fear became a reality. As gently as I could, I sl*pped into bed. I wasn’t sure if it was because the bed dipped because she sensed my presence but she turned and tried to curl into me. Since her arms were sec to her torso, she couldn’t really put pressure on her shoulders.

“Shh, I’m right here.” I said as I rested my head against her. Laying my arm over her stomach, I felt her b*dy relax before her breathing leveled out again. She was strong enough to not have an side effects from this ordeal but she will need me to be extra attentive to her. She wasn’t going to be leaving my eyesight. Kristen POV The only reason I was awake right now was because my shoulders were screaming in pain. I wasn’t sure if it was because I couldn’t move them or because they were out of their sockets for so long. Alec was still beside me, which I was thankful for. “Alec?” I tried to nudge him with my leg. “Hmm?” “Can you unwrap me?” “Unwrap your Alec opened his eyes and looked at me. “Yes I need to move them” Alec sat up and helped me unwrap the bandage. The more he went, the more the bruising was showing At some point, they must have removed the shirt Alec put me in so when he took the bandage off, I w n*ked. Bruising ran around my shoulders, down my chest and arms and surly down my back. It was angry purple and blue but there was some yellowing. As soon as it was all off, I was able to move my arms a little. They were extremely sore and stiff but it was nice to adjust their positioning a little. Alec leaned over and grabbed something off the floor. “Here, you can wear this.” Sl*pping each arm in, he helped me pull it over my head. “How are your shoulders feeling?” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!noveldrama







###Chapter 191
Chapter 0191 “Sore and stiff but not terrible.” “Good, Lay back and I’ll get us some breakfast brought up.” Alec helped me adjust the pillows. There was two behind me so I was at an angle and he put one pillow under each arm to keep them at a good angle. Once I was situated, he got up. “You aren’t leaving are you?” I asked quietly. His b*dy froze as he looked at me. “I won’t be leaving you for a long time.” He said before he started walking towards the bathroom. Trying to relax was more difficult. Not because of the pain, but because I didn’t want to be alone right. now. As much as I tried to calm my anxiety, every second Alec wasn’t in my eyesight, I started to get antsy. I hated this. Hated everything about feeling this way. I was a strong independent woman. Feeling

vulnerable and weak was no in my vocabulary. This wasn’t supposed to happen to me. “What’s wrong?” Alec asked as he came out from the bathroom. He was only wearing shorts so he bruising was clearly visible. Some were yellow but there was some new ones that were black and blue. “Why do you have bruising like that? Some old and some new?” I asked. “I needed to get some frustration out last night. I spared with Colt. He was probably the only persor could handle me.” Alec said like it was no big deal. He laid down in bed but didn’t touch me. “Cuddle with me?” I asked. Alec grabbed the remote and turned the T.V. on as he rolled over. Scooting up, he had his arm over the myb top of my head so his arm could play with my hair. He was probably as close as he could be without actually touching me. Though, since both arms were hurt, it wasn’t like he could lay on my other side. Fl*pping through the channels, he finally settled on Master Chef. After about twenty minutes, I couldn’t noveldrama

hold my bladder anymore. Peeing was going to be rough but I couldn’t push it off. Using my sore muscles, I just sat up quickly as possible. “Oh, that hurts.” I groaned. It didn’t hurt to straighten out my elbows. Which in itself was a blessing. Still, it took me a second to allow my shoulders to relax. However, I kept them at an angle. The red lines around my wrist and ankles reminded me of why I was in this much pain. As I got up, there was a knock on the door. “That is probably the food.” Alec got up and headed towards the door as I made my way to the bathroom. He waited until I was fully inside before he opened the door. Since I only had underwear on, it was a little easier to gently pull them down to pee. The trickier part was “You okay?” Alec said in our mind-link. I must have taken long than I thought to go. “Yeah, it’s not the easiest thing to do right now.” Looking at myself in the mirror, I tried to move my shoulders around. Maybe working them would get it to loosen up. After about five minutes, all that i accomplished was creating more pain for myself.. “What are you doing?” Alec opened the door and looked at me as I was rotating my shoulder. “Trying to loosen up the soreness but it isn’t helping.” “Here. Let me help you.” Alec stood behind me. Grabbing my arm, I allowed it to go limp as he rotated in a way that I was not able to. He was actually making good progress before moving to the other arm. “That helped.” I said as Alec put my arm down. “Good. After we eat, I’ll get some ice for them. Do you want to try to shower?” “After I eat.” I was feeling rather uneasy on my feet and needed to sit down.

“Alright.” Alec guided me to the couch. He had set up a small picnic like meal on the coffee table. There was different fruits and veggies with cold cut sandwiches. “There is either turkey or roast beef?”







###Chapter 192
Chapter 0192 “Turkey, please.” Alec grabbed the plate with turkey and added some fruit to it while I got comfortable against the couch. His b*dy froze for a second before continuing to put random stuff on it. “What?” I asked. He handed me my plate as he frowned. “Emmy wants to come see you. So does everyone else.” Alec sighed as he took the roast beef and filled his plate with fruit. “What did you tell them?” “Colt is coming up now but the rest are going to have to wait until you showered and relaxed a little.” Right as he finished his sentence, there was a knock on the door. Thankfully, Alec got up and answered it. Colt and Alec shook hands as he entered before coming over to me. “How are you feeling, sis?” Colt sat down close to me but not enough to move or touch me.

“Sore. I think so food and a shower will help.” Colt reached over and moved my shirt down a little to look at the bruising. “Impressive.” “They will still be that way tomorrow for prom.” Alec and Colt shared a look. “What?” “About prom… we were thinking maybe we should just s kip it.” Colt said as I took a bite. “S kip prom?” I just kept chewing as they looked at me. “We are also moving forward with the attack tonight. Alec is going to stay home with you but the rest c us are going. Things are just too intense right now to be going to a public event like that.” Colt looked at me and laid it out. My heart broke a little over no prom. It wasn’t exactly prom that I was sad about but Penny and I spent hours organizing and planning for this event. Seeing the final results and everyone having fun is the rewarding part. “Okay.” “We can have a small prom here?” Colt asked as if to make it up

p to me. Wanting to change the subject, “Are we still having lunch on Sunday?” Colt frowned but didn’t push the subject. “Yes, we are.” “And our tests?” “That is rescheduled for Monday.” Alec answered for Colt. “I’m so sorry. I know none of this is what you wanted.” Colt looked at me and put his hand on my leg. “No one asked for this. To think, I used to just be worried I would be stuck with A nn. I shook my head. ! wish that was my old problem. The guys didn’t say anything but just sat there as I went through the emotions. With each bite I took, I focused on something new. Rogues are after me to kidnap me to take me to Darin. I can’t believe the only reason he wants me is to f uck me. There has to be something else. Being in that building was literally my worst fear. It was a weird feeling. Since my fear has already become a reality, I wasn’t as afraid as I was but there was still a part of me that panics just thinking about it. However, it will not define me. Alpha Marc and Luna Erin won’t give Alec the Alpha title until this is all done and over with. They just want me to travel and basically leave it up to them. So far, we have done exactly what they wanted and it has not been successful. Either strategy is not working and will need to change. “Are you going to tell me what is going on in there?” Colt asked after awhile. “Things need to change.” I said simply without looking at either of them. “What do you mean?” Alec asked. “What I mean is, I am going to shower and then we are having a full meeting with Alpha Marc, dad and everyone. I am done standing on the side lines. If my life is going to be on the line, I am not leaving it up to someone else to decide what my actions should be. We will attack tonight and this will be declarin- war on them. They have had too many victories and I am not going to be starting my luna rein like th will not be known as someone who lays down and takes it. No, this stops now. With me.” noveldrama







###Chapter 193
Chapter 0193 Standing up, I walked passed Alec and headed towards the shower. Right as the door was about to close, I heard them speak. “Ah, s hit.” Colt muttered. “This is going to be good. I’ve been waiting for her to snap.” Alec almost sounded like he was laughing. “I’ll let everyone know to be ready. The ice storm is here.” Colt said before I shut the door. My shower was hot, massaging my muscles as it pounded my muscles. Moving my neck around, I let it work each part. Although, the worst was my shoulders, my knees were killing me from having my legs tied down too. However, it was when I was trying to wash my hair I realized I had a problem. “Alec?” I mind-linked him. “Yes?” “I can’t wash my own f ucking hair.” I felt him trying to repress his humor he felt but it didn’t fully work. However, he didn’t answer me either. Instead, I heard the bathroom door open and some wrestling before. Alec got in the shower with me.

“Turn around.” He said as he sl*pped in the water to get wet. Obeying his order, I turned around. The sound of the shampoo cap opening and closing was anticipation enough to know he was going to help me out. “Where is Colt?” The thought of Colt sitting in the living room while Alec was in the shower with me was unsettling to say the least. “He went down stairs to have everyone ready.” Alec turned me around so I could let the water rinse out my hair. “I’m done feeling like I have no control.” I said finally to Alec after a few moments of silence. He was putting conditioner in my hair. “Good.” Alec said simply.

“Good?” I turned back around and Alec helped rinsed out my hair again. He grabbed the b*dy wash and started cleaning my b*dy. emotions and “Yes. I’m happy you aren’t letting what happened restrict you. You are taking control of your turning it into something positive. I’ll stand beside you the entire time but this just shows me how strong you are.” Alec took my face in his hands and stared into my eyes. “I love you more than anything. I’ll always be beside you and I fully agree with you. We are going to take our power back.” Knowing that Alec was behind me just fueled the fire. “And Colt?” I asked as Alec moved us so he could take his shower. “Will be on your other side.” “I think the only people to have an issue will be your parents.” I said trying to get ahead of any issues. “F uck them.” Alec shrugged. He was washing his hair out from the shampoo. His eyes were closed as he Just let the water hit the top of his head and rain down. Part of me felt bad for him. To stand up like this against his parents isn’t an easy thing to do. Especially when they asked for us to not worry and basically travel to Italy or anywhere and ignore everything. It’s hard to ignore being kidnapped. Alec turned the water off and pulled me out of my thoughts. Holding my waist, he helped me out of the shower and started drying me. “I can do that.” I said. “I know.” There wasn’t anything S**ual about him taking care of me like this. It was more primal, like he was making sure I was okay everywhere else. My ankles and wrist were turning green but still looked angry. There was random bruising down my legs and my stomach and chest. Some I wasn’t even sure I remembered what happened. “Let’s get dressed and head down there.” Alec said as he finished with brushing out my hair.. Mrs. Smith noveldrama







###Chapter 194
Chapter 0194 “Ready?” Alec asked me. I decided to put on a t-shirt and shorts. Alec pulled out two slings for me. It took a few minutes to get them adjusted but I had to grudgingly admit they did help with the stiffness of my shoulders. Alec was getting himself finished up and I was just looking at myself in the mirror. “Yeah, as ready as I’ll ever be.” Some of the fire had settled but not enough that I wasn’t going to let them get their way. “Good, let’s go.” Alec put his hand on my lower back as he walked with me to the door. Everything was quiet in the packhouse, making it feel unnatural. It was still the school year I suppose but this quiet was not something I welcomed right now. As we came up to Alpha Marc’s office, I could hear his voice. “Why the hell are we are here, Colt?” He was already angry. Looking at Alec, he nodded before we walked into his office. “Because I wanted everyone here.” I said firmly as I walked in. Alec was behind me but I could feel his

authority puff out a little. The door quietly closed behind us. Alpha Marc, Luna Erin, Jasper, and Colt. Alpha Marc had the speaker phone on with my dad on it. “Hey Kristen. I am happy to hear your voice. How are you?” Dad asked me. “We can discuss me later, dad. I didn’t come here for pleasantries.” I moved to the front of the room. Alec moved to stand off to the side but still near me. His arms were crossed over his chest and his eyes n left me. “Hmm, well, what is going on?” Dad’s voice told me he wasn’t sure he wanted to hear this. “I’m done.” I said simply while looking directly at Alpha Marc. “I’m done being sidelined by you. I am done not being told what is all going on and I am done with being told that you would handle things. With all due respect, you handling things didn’t keep me from being kidnapped by Darin. We will not be

sidelined anymore. From here on out, we will be involved in everything. Every decision and every piece of Information will go through us. I am the one with a genius IQ. We will not be tucking tail and running on some stu pid vacation while our pack is in trouble. I will not be known as the luna that hides away when things get tough. Darin and Rip need to be eliminated.” I kept my face void of any emotions. My eyes never left his as I drove each point home. You could hear a pin drop when I stopped talking. No one made a sound. Dad didn’t talk. Alpha Marc only narrowed his eyes, Luna Erin looked shocked as she sat in her own chair. I couldn’t see Jasper, Colt or Alec. Alec was feeling rather proud of me at the moment. “Are you sure you want that?” Alpha Marc said after awhile. “It isn’t a matter of wanting anything. I was born to a luna. I was mated to an alpha male. It is in my blood to handle the hard times. Getting kidnapped isn’t going to keep me in bed with my head under the covers I can and will handle anything that is thrown in front of me. Unit now, you have not allowed me to show you my u my true capabilities. You have kept me sidelined and in the dark. Unless it directly affected my day to day activities, you have ignored me. Worst, you have ignored your son. You have no shown any confidence in us. Now, I am demanding you respectfully… to cut the s hit and allow us to take back control of this situation.” “You think coming into MY office and demanding something like that is going to get you what you want?” Alpha Marc said calmly but with a controlled anger “You would have discarded any attempt I could or would have made. You even had Luna Erin suggest we just focus on being mates and not worry about what is going on. That doesn’t work for me. Not any longer. You were not the one being tied to a chair. You were not the one being kicked, punched and

touched inappropriately. You have no idea what I had been through. So, yes. Yes I am standing here demanding you to include us in the decision making process. They made a direct attack on this pack. They kidnapped me! The future luna and now I am demanding to be involved in this.” noveldrama






###Chapter 195
Chapter 0195 “You support this?” Alpha Marc looked over at Alec. “Completely. We should have never been sidelined. This is our lives and Kristen could have died.” Alpha Marc looked at me before his eyes moved to my shoulders. “I am, of course, happy you are okay but don’t you think you need to just rest can recover?” “No. That is not how this is going to work.” Alec stepped forward. He was directly behind me as he stood up to his dad. “I should have never allowed you to push us off in the beginning. All the decisions you have made only made thigs worse. We need to be involved in this. Kristen has the IQ to figure things out. Use her.” “Dad, care to weigh in?” I asked firmly. “I’m surprised you were kept on the sidelines this entire time. Why were they not included in on what’s going on?” “You didn’t know that Luna Erin had a conversation with us about us traveling and leaving everything to

them?” I was stunned. “No.” Dad’s voice confirmed his annoyance. Colt stood up. “If you refuse to include them, than I will see to it that they are included in. They wil kept out of this and I am appalled this is even happening.” Colt’s authority was showing. He wasr. yet but he only had a few more days, however, Alpha Marc didn’t know that yet. “Well, it seems I am over ruled here.” Alpha Marc looked over at Luna Erin. “For the record, I think this is terrible idea and don’t believe they are ready for this.” “How would you know when you have never given us a shot?” I was feeling rather pi s sed off. “With all due respect, you don’t know s hit about me or what I am capable of. You have done nothing but kept me pushed off to the side. If I didn’t know better, I would say you are using me as an excuse to not give up the Alpha position to Alec.”

That really set him off. Alpha Marc slammed his hands down on the desk and stood up. “Now, listen here “No.” Alec walked in front of me. “You and I have had the exact same conversation. I never once repeated it to Kristen. She figured it out all on her own. You will not speak to her in that way and I have already told you my position. I am prepared to challenge you if I need to but I rather we just agree to work together.” “Kids, leave the room and let Marc and I have a conversation.” Dad said in restraint anger. It took both Colt and Alec to half drag me out of that room. I wouldn’t take my eyes off Alpha Marc to make my point clear. However, since they were trying to not hurt me, it took a little bit. As soon as they got me out of the room, it felt like I was finally able to breath again. “Are you serious, dude? You would challenge him? Colt asked. “I am starting to think dad won’t give it up. It is always one excuse after another. I don’t want to challenge him but he keeps making decisions that affect this pack, affect Kristen.” “You know that is till death… Colt reiterated. I just looked at Alec in shock. I was surprised when he said it but I just assumed it was a scare tactic. “I’m not allowing Kristen’s life to be on the line again and not have a say in what is happening” Alec was firm in his conviction. “Alec…” I could not be the reason he wants to challenge his dad. “No, this is my decision.” He looked down at me, his eyes were full of anger. “But not at my expense.” Alec just sl*pped his arm around me and k*ssed my forehead. “Colt, tell him he shouldn’t do that.” I pleaded with Colt. “Ice, I would do the same.” Colt looked at me. “I am doing the same. I am helping dad reject her. Which,

we both know might kill him.” “That is not the same and you know it!” I snapped. I, momentarily forgot my arms were in slin to reach out to him. Pain shot down my back for a quick second.noveldrama







###Chapter 196
Chapter 0196 The door to his office opened, Luna Erin stuck her head out and nodded for us to come back in. This entire time, Jasper new said a word and it was only then that I wondered were Jacob was. Alec kept his arms folded as he stood directly in front of his dad. Colt and I stood back as this conversation was no longer about me but about being included. It was more between father and son. “We have come to the agreement that you two may be included in any meetings and be available to all information. However, the final decisions will be made by me.” Alpha Marc said. “As long as it is understood that our opinion will not be ignored and have an equal say in things. You need to respect that fact that it is our lives on the line. You have been grooming me my entire life to take over for you.” noveldrama

“Which is why I won’t turn things over to you when they are this bad.” Alpha Marc said surprisingly calm. “Good. Now that, that is settled. We need to finalize the plans for tonight.” Dad said over the phone. “We have a team and you have a team. This will happen in two waves. Since the building is a mechanical shop, my team will be planting bombs. You will be responsible for covering any remaining survivors.” Alpha Marc said to dad. “Why did we decide to move it up a day and not wait till prom?” I asked. “For a couple different reasons. First one being you. The fact they kidnapped you. Next would be t would be a great affect with the place being full of their business. We have someone going under cov a vehicle to get into the building. That car will be rigged to blow. Third, most importantly, we need to g the upper hand and quickly.” Alpha Marc stated as he looked at me. “What are the next steps after that?” Alec asked, “I found someone that will come by tomorrow. He is going to install an upgraded security system around here. It will alter to any drones or any movement within two miles of your boarders. They are

motion detected so any animal could set it off. Either way, someone is going to have to monitor them constantly.” Colt said. “Is that where Jacob is?” I asked. “Yes, he is finalizing it all.” “Who is your beta?” Alpha Marc asked. “Jacob will move up after he proves himself in the next day or so.” Colt answered. “I want to know if we have gotten anywhere on Penny’s dad.” I said looking around the room. “We have heard rumors that he is still alive and around. We don’t have a name or a picture but we are working on it.” Dad said. “That is where Beta Andrew is. He is currently underground working on it.” Alpha Marc said. I looked over at Jasper. That was his dad and the concern was clear. “We have been trying to gather information before we strike.” Luna Erin spoke up for the first time. “We can’t wait any longer for information.” I said firmly. “We have to take action. I know information is key but it could take weeks if not months to achieve anything. I am not waiting that long for revenge.” “I can see that.” Alpha Marc said. “Since you want to be involved. I have the files from the phone. I need you go look through it and see if you find anything else we missed or could use to our advantage.” Alpha Marc pushed a flash drive over to me. “Where are we going to do this at?” Alec asked. “Your office.” Luna Erin smiled at us. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! I am so sorry I didn’t post the last few days. It’s been crazy around here!







###Chapter 197
Chapter 0197 “MY office?” Alec asked as if to clarify what he heard. “That’s right. I have spent the last two days working on your office. Come see.” Luna Erin smiled at us as she walked past us. Alec looked at me in confusion but put his hand on my back, pushing me forward. I remembered us talking about it but it completely escaped my mind with everything that is going on. Luna Erin waited for us to gather around the door before she unlocked it. Swinging the door open, she allowed us to walk through first. My first impression was complete shock. Everything was just like I pictured. My drawings were on the walls, and she even had the desks I bought fixed up. One for each of us. It wasn’t huge but there was still room for a small couch against the wall with a wet bar. Two beige arm chairs sat in front of each desk. “I left it partially bare so you can put your personal touches to it. When you guys officially take over, we can rotate offices.” Luna Erin had a small smile on her face.. “If I could hug you I would.” I was in awe with how perfect it was in this short amount of time. She really did capture everything.

ave you ki “I’m so glad you like it!” Alec pulled his mom in for a hug. “I’ll to look through the phone. Maybe you will see something we didn’t. Either way, your passwords are on a sticky note on the computers. Feel free to change them as you see fit.” “Thanks, mom.” Alec said as she turned to leave. “Of course. We love you both.” Luna Erin gave me a smile before walking out and closing the door. “We have an office…” I whispered as Alec walked around and claimed a desk. Starting up the compute. he pulled over the other desk chair for me to sit next to him on. I wasn’t sure what style or fabric these chairs were but it screamed money to me.

“Do you want to start with the pictures or with something else?” Alec asked as the different folders popped up after he inserted the flash drive. “Pictures are fine.” Alec nodded and double clicked the pictures. Most of them where of just me doing daily things. Nothing crazy, going to the pool or eating lunch outside. Most of them were far enough away that you could still see my face but still see where I was at. The pool, it was close enough that when I was laughing, you could see my face but then you could see what landscape behind me. “Oh…s hit….” I said slowly. I “What?” “Can you print out all the pictures?” I asked as a sinking feeling came over me. “There are like hundreds…” Alec sounded perplexed. “Just do IT!” I stood up as I started to panic. “Okay, they are printing. What’s wrong?” Alec stood up and looked at me concerned. I I needed my hands, I needed these things off me. “Take these off of me.” I knew I almost sounded like I was having a panic attack but maybe I was. My heart was being fast as it dropped to my stomach. Alec quickly helped me remove each sling. As they printed, they came out in order. Grabbing a pair of scissors, I started cutting each picture. “Move the chairs off to the sides. Move everything.” I demanded. n out Alec didn’t even hesitate as he did exactly like I asked. One by one, I cut the pictures and laid them das “Holy…f uck…” Alec whispered as he realized what I was doing. He ran out of the room as if mind- linking wasn’t going to get his point across. He came back a minute later with Alpha Marc and Colt in tow. didn’t st though, I kept going. My shoulders protested as I kept going. Each cut sent pain up and down my arm but I refused to stop. No one spoke as I perfected each pictures. It had dawned on me that it wasn’t all

about me. Each picture was of the surrounding area I was at. At the time, I assumed it was just because that is all the drone could get but no I see I was wrong.noveldrama







###Chapter 198
Chapter 0198 I had just finished with the pictures of my shop. From all the different angles, it perfectly showed a view of the entire street in front of my shop. My store was the focal point but it showed how to find it. It showed the angle that Alec was shot at. “I would bet money this is the angle you got shot at.” I pointed directly where we would have been standing when he was shot in the arm. “What are you saying?” Alpha Marc was flabbergasted. “What I am saying is, it wasn’t all about me. Yes, he wanted me but this pictures show the exact layout of our pack. Each pictures is a different angle. Look, I am just sitting at the pool with Emmy. There are five different t angles to the same position I was at. When you cut them and put them together, it lays out the entire layout of the pool. I can connect it with the playground next to it and the school beyond that. Don’t you see, they have the entire layout of our territory!” I Their eyes moved from picture to picture. It wasn’t until I put them next to eachother that they connected the dots. “He knows where everything is at.” Alec said quietly. “He knew exactly where to go to kidnap me. He knew what to avoid and how to get there.” I clarified just in case they didn’t get it through their heads. “I can’t believe this.” Alec rubbed his hands over his face. “That’s not the worst part. Look!” I pointed out the boarders. “They know our schedule.” Alpha Marc’s eyes got wide as he ran out of the room. “Are you sure?” Colt asked me. I knew he wasn’t exactly questioning me but he was in shock as well.

“I was only ever quickly shown the pictures. I never got to really look at them before now.” I pleaded with Colt to understand. “This isn’t your fault.” Colt her his hand on my shoulder. I tried not to wince but he quickly removed it and looked at me apologetically. Standing up, he looked over at Alec. “I am sending a group of warriors to beef up the boarders until you guys can figure out a new plan. noveldrama

“Okay.” Alec didn’t even try to argue. “We will also be issuing a state of emergency.” “Good.” Colt nodded as he left the room and pulled out his cell phone. It was just me and Alec in silence listening to the printer continue to print pictures. After a few minutes, Alec walked over to top the printer. “DON’T!” I yelled. “Why?” “I need to make sure there isn’t anything else in those pictures.” Alec frowned but nodded. “Get Emmy in here.” I said without looking at him. I knew it sounded bit chy but she would be the only other person that I trusted to be able to do this with me. We had done these before to try to push my brain. “Emmy?” Yes, s, get her in here.” I picked up another picture and kept working on cutting them and fitting them into their spots. It was like a massive j ig saw puzzle. Alec sat on the couch and just watched me work. “What is so urgent?” Jasper walked in and looked over at me on the floor. “Ice?” Emmy asked as she kneeled down I need your help. Remember when we did that puzzle when we were trying to figure out my IQ?” I looked at her in panic. “Yeah, it took us hours….” Emmy looked around. “I need you to help me do the same. These are the pictures we found on the phone. Look! They aren’t just of me but of the entire pack layout.” “Oh f uck..” Jasper’s eyes got wide as he looked around. I didn’t even care that some of them had Alec and I having S** in some. “Okay, I need a pair of scissors and a trash bucket.” Emmy said as she looked around. “Trash bucket?” Alec asked. “To throw up in. It’s been a bad morning.” I stopped and looked at her. She was extremely pale and loo k ing rather ragged.

“Emmy…” I said in a soft voice. “I’m okay. I was going to go crazy staring at the same walls. You can only hug a toilet for so long.” She gave me a weak smile before she turned her attention to the task at hand. GET IT NOW







###Chapter 199
Chapter 0199 “Do you need snacks? Fruit? Nuts? What sounds good to you?” I asked. “Lunchable’s.” Emmy looked up at me. My eyes went from hers to Alec’s. He nodded and left the room. We worked for about fifteen minutes before Emmy threw up in her trash can. Jasper had returned just in time to see it. Without saying a word, he handed her a water and grabbed the trash liner. “Have you tried gatorade? I asked. “What do you mean?” Jasper asked. “Electrolytes. She needs electrolytes. Gatorade or even pediaSure would be okay.” “What flavor do you want?” Jasper asked Emmy. “Oh, um lemon.” I had to scrunch up my face. “Lemon?” “I know but it sounds good.” Emmy gave me a look that said she knew what I meant. Alec came back with lunchables as Jasper was leaving. Emmy took one and slowly started munching on it. “Ice?” Emmy said after another five minutes had went by. noveldrama

“What?” I asked without looking up. “What does this look like to you?” She handed me a picture. It was actually a picture of Alec and I in the woods having S**. I was riding him as he was leaning against a tree. “Looks like a good time?” I asked looking at her. “I mean, behind you. Is that a hand?” Taking the photo from Emmy, I looked at it carefully. It did in fact looked like a hand but it was just a hand. This area was part of the forest we had not gotten to yet. It was on the edge but far enough in that you wouldn’t see us. It was the risk of getting caught that made us do it there. However, this photo was taken at the same time as the hand in the background. “Alec…” I said as I stood up.

He came over to me. “What is it?” “Does that look like a hand?” I pointed it out. “It….does.” “Alec, this is one photo. How did a hand get there behind us having S**?” Alec looked up at me. “I am going to look into this. Do not move from this room. Understood? I am putting a guard out front.” “Wait!” I said as he turned to leave. “C-can you just….. send someone else?” I was hesitant to ask like this but I felt myself start to panic. “I’ll have Jasper come back?” Alec stopped and put his hand on my chin. “Okay.” Alec turned to leave. “But! Wait till he is here?” I let Alec see the vulnerability in my eyes. “Okay.” that way but I looked down ashamed I even felt I did. As much as I wasn’t going to let my kidnapping bring me down, I couldn’t lie and say I wanted to be alone either. Slowly, I sank back down and picked up I the scissors. My hands shook as I continued to cut. Emmy saw this but didn’t comment. Instead, she kept going as well. here.” Jaspers said after what felt like hours. “Stay here with the girls. I need to check something out and under no circumstances are you to leave Kristen’s eyesight.” Alec didn’t command Jasper but he was firm in his instructions. “Got it.” Jasper walked in with a gatorade. After handing it to Emmy, he went to sit down. “Can y-you shut the door?” I asked quickly. “Sure?” Jasper got up and shut the door. “Lock it?” Jasper gave me a look but nodded. He gave me a look to ask me if I was satisfied and I nodded. Sitting down beside Emmy, he watched us work.

“Alec?” I asked in the mind-link. “Are you okay?” He asked, knowing and fully I was not okay. “Can we keep this open?” “Of course.” He sounded like he was running. “I’m sorry, 1-” aware # Mrs. Smith Author







###Chapter 200
Chapter 0200 “Just getting there.” Alec said. “You keep working and I’ll let you know if I find anything.” “Okay.” Grabbing another picture, I started cutting it but much slower. The printer finally stopped printing and I was so thankful. Emmy was moving rather quickly after she had the gatorade and lunchables. I had a feeling she probably shouldn’t have had the lunchables but her color was already looking better. Picking up another photo, I started trimming it so it matched the location and there wasn’t any overlap. Right as I was about to cut, I noticed a head looking out from behind a tree. This face looked like someone I knew. “Jasper…” I asked in a worried tone. “What?” Jasper moved over to me. “Look.” I handed him the partially cut photo. “That is a head.” Jasper said. The picture was of me going for a run. Alec was with me and we didn’t even notice a person behind a tree? “Doesn’t it look like someone?” I pushed. “I’m not sure… “Emmy, doesn’t that look like someone?” I took it from his hands and gave it to Emmy. She squinted at it before her eyes widened. “Penny?”

“It’s the same nose!” I said. “Same face shape and that little half smile she has.” Emmy agreed. “There isn’t a way to prove this but it is enough to give us pause.” I said as I looked at the face. “Where is that at?” Jasper asked. “A stranger… literally twenty feet from you and Alec. How did he get there?” “This is like on the other side of the pack. This is by the pond.” I said. “Almost where we came across the rogues.” noveldrama

“Are you telling Alec?” I asked. “Yes.” Jasper said after a moment. “Did they find the one location?” Emmy asked. “They did.” He didn’t elaborate. “Alec?” I asked in the mind-link. “Everything okay?” He answered. Alec sounded out of breath. “Did you find something?” “A tunnel. I have some men seeing where it ends. I am going to the other location that you found.” “I only have a tree. It could be anywhere.” “I know but it’s worth looking into. Dad called in some people to come do a full ground search with sonar. It will look for voids to find any tunnels.” “This is bad.” I said. “Have to finished all the other pictures?” Alec asked. “Just about, a few more to do.” “Good. Let me know if you find anything else. If not, you can move on to another part of the phone.” “How much longer are you going to be?” I hated sounded needy. “It’s going to be a little. I have Cash working on a few things and Colt is coming through on his end.” “This is turning into a cluster f uck. We might need to consider moving completely out of this pack. Thir. about it. I or anyone could have been hurt or kidnapped at anytime. Is it really safe here?” Emmy was finishing the last of the pictures and Jasper had taken the photo back and was studying it. “I was thinking the same thing. I was actually thinking if we moved all women and children and left the warriors, we could be ready when they attack. After tonight, they could be attacking as early as tomorrow.” Alec sounded like he was running. “Move them all to Colt’s pack as the attack is going on. That way they are occupied.” I suggested. “I wish I could be with you but take Jasper and go to dad’s office and catch him up.” Alec seemed almost

distracted at this point. “Okay.” I didn’t cut the mind-link but I pushed it back. If I wanted to, I could hear what Alec was saying but I tuned him out. “Jasper?” “Yeah?” “I need to speak with Alpha Marc, can you take me?” I asked standing up. He really didn’t have an cntion “Of course Emmy? Will you be okay?” Jasper asked her GET IT NOW







###Chapter 201
“Oh yeah, I’m not moving anywhere anytime soon. My as s is numb.” Emmy said without looking up. She was still focused on the remaining pictures.

Jasper nodded and opened the door. Allowing me to go first, he shut the door and locked it before we made our way to his office. Jasper knocked once before he opened the door.

“What is it? Find anything else?” Alpha Marc looking concerned as I walked in.

“There is another pictures of …” I started but Jasper walked forward and handed it to Alpha Marc. “Does that man look like Penny?” I asked, changing directions.

“Hmm, I don’t know.” Alpha Marc was rubbing his chin as he leaned back. “I rather not look at a photo of

my son and his mate having a private moment.” He said after a moment.

“Ignore that part. Focus more on the part that this man is not part of our pack and is standing behind us and we never noticed.” I said more urgently.

“I mean, I could see why you didn’t notice.” Alpha Marc looked and me and frowned.

“When focus on the part where this location is by the pond. Around the same location that the rogues

were found by us. The same location that is on the opposite side of the pack from the first tunnel that is

was found.”

His eyes narrowed as I filled him in. Alpha Marc had his hands folded in front of him. I noticed hisnoveldrama

knuckles turning white as his b*dy refused to move. His eyes didn’t blink as they drilled holes into mine.

At first, I wasn’t sure if he was mind-linking Alec or what he was doing. After a moment, I just assumed he

was processing what this actually met.

“Alec and I have a plan and we want to run it by you.” I said after a long pregnant pause.

“What is it?” Alpha Marc said through clenched teeth.

“They are not aware we know about these tunnels and not sure if there is anymore. However, when we

attack tonight, we move all the women, children and elderly over to Colt’s pack. Leave only the warriors

and stage them accordingly. Use our territory as a battle ground. Set traps or whatever but when they

come, we will be ready. Alec thinks after tonight, they might attack as early as tomorrow morning.”

Again, Alpha Marc just stared at me. It was hard to get a reading on how he felt about this. It was only

after five minutes, did he finally speak. “Have you talked to Colt or your dad?”

“No, sir. We felt it was best to discuss with you before moving forward. Per the terms of our agreement, and because we value your expertise in these matters. We weren’t sure how you felt this plan would

Alpha Marc didn’t answer, instead, ne picked up the pi speaker phone. It rang twice before it was picked up.

“Marc.” Dad’s voice filled the office.

“I am here with your daughter. We have a development that you need to be filled in on.” Alpha Marc leaned back in his chair and motioned for me to continue.

“Jasper, can you move this chair closer? I need to sit down.” I asked him.

He didn’t answer but quickly moved over to the arm chair and pushed it up against the desk. Alpha Marc even moved the phone over so it would be easier to speak with my dad.

“Kristen? What’s going on?” Dad’s voice was full of concern.

“I’m assuming Colt filled you in. You are aware a tunnel was found and how it was found?” I started, hoping this was the case because I did not want to explain that again.

“Briefly. Not as clear on how but I know about the tunnel.”

“Okay, well, we found another one. This one is on the other side of the pack, near where the rogues jumped the boarder. However, the man in the photo looks similar to Penny. Alpha Marc isn’t as sure but I feel like there is enough resemblance that we need to pay attention to it.








###Chapter 202
Dad was quiet for a moment. “This is f ucking insane.” He sounded tired.

“Alec and I have a plan.” I said quickly.

“What is it?”

“Tonight, while s hit is happening, all the women, children and elderly needs to move to your pack. Since everyone will be elsewhere, this will be a good time to move people to safety. Then, we can use our territory to set up the attack. Allow them to think they are coming back to retaliate. Alec thinks they will attack us by morning.” I didn’t want to come out and say it as I was unsure who was all listening on his end.

“Thhhhhhhhat might work. They might have people watching so it would need to be after the attack in hopes that they retreated all their men. However, we would have to move everyone in waves and do it quickly. Obviously we will take anyone who needs shelter but with the attack, we will be low on warriors.”

“We haven’t worked out details but more of the overall plan. We wanted to see how you both felt about it before thinking about details on how to execute the plan.” I said, trying to sound grownup and luna like.

“There are five hours left until our warriors leave. You have four to come up with a plan and present it to us. Understood?” Dad said in a newly found hopeful tone.

“Yes, sir.” I said, feeling rather confident. noveldrama

“Kristen?” Dad asked, a little more shyly.

“What?”

“How are you doing?”

“Oh, um, physically I have been better. Not as bad as yesterday and the shower really helped.” I tried to

move them up and around. It was a little sore but not terrible.

“And emotionally? Me ntally?” Dad pushed.

“Working on that. It’s…” I felt rather awkward saying this in front of Jasper and Alpha Marc. Both were

listening closely. “…coming along. I rather not be left alone at the moment.”

“All normal feelings. That is completely normal to need someone with you after what you been through,

Don’t be ashamed of that.” Dad drove in his point.

“Thanks, dad.” I said feeling rather exposed.

“I’ll talk to you in four hours.” Dad hung up the phone and I felt rather encouraged.

“See you in four hours.” Alpha Marc gave me such a small smile that I almost missed it.

Jasper held the door for me as I walked out of it. “That went better than I expected it to.” He whispered. as we came up to my office.

“Me too. I thought he was going to rip my head off.” I mumbled as Jasper opened the door to a happy Emmy.

“All done!” She looked rather proud of herself and I was beyond happy about this.

“Anymore clues?” I asked as I sat in my chair.

“Nothing that is jumping out of me.” Emmy sighed.

“Listen, I have a new task. Do you remember how I organized your beta duties?” I asked.

“Of course. I still use that system everyday.” Emmy looked confused.

“Good. I need to know how many women, children and elderly people we have here that is not eligible to fight.” She blinked a few times before looking at Jasper.

“Baby, can you get my laptop from our room?”

“Sure.” Jasper stood up instantly but hesitated after he realized what she just asked of him. He turned and looked at me, as if to say he had permission.

“Make it fast.” I said as I looked down. My anxiety started flying but I tried to fight it. There was no reason to get nervous over Jasper going down the hall and coming right back.

“Ice?” Emmy brought me out of my inner thoughts with a concerned voice.

“What?” I asked, not sure I wanted to know which topic she wanted to know about.







###Chapter 203
“Are we going to be okay?” Her eyes were full of her fear. I watched as her eyes filled with tears that she forcefully held back.

“I’m trying to make sure of that.” I promised.

Emmy nodded and rubbed her swollen belly. At this moment, I was glad I wasn’t pregnant. The thought of having a baby right now scared the s hit out of me. When we do have kids, I want it to be as relaxing as possible. Right now, Emmy was having a very stressful pregnancy.

“Here it is.” Jasper said as he came back. He was slightly out of breath, telling me he ran the whole way.

“Thank you.” Emmy took it and opened it. “I have the list of pack members. Give me a little to sort them out.” noveldrama

“That’s fine. Jasper, I’ll need your help since I don’t have arms.’

Jasper came over and sat in Alec’s chair. “What do you need?”

”

“Emmy, will you h ook up to our printer and print out the blueprints to the pack?” I asked.

“Sure.” Emmy didn’t even look at me.

“Jasper, can you draw a map of the distance between our pack and Colt’s?”

Jasper grabbed a blank sheet of paper and started mapping out the landmarks. It was incredibly rough and he had no measurable artistic ability but you could still understand it.

“The woods would provide a good coverage, however, it would also conceal their warriors as well.”

“By road?” Jasper asked as his pencil traced over the little squiggle line that was supposed to be a road.

“Possibly. It would be the quickest and allow us to take bigger groups. That would depend on how many people we need to transfer over.” It wasn’t like we had a unlimited number of options.

“We could take an alternate route. That way, they aren’t watching us move. It would take longer but it might be more affective in the long run. We can’t put surveillance footage up in the those trees in this time frame.” I drew a line that went out the side of our pack and completely around.

“That is all forest.” Jasper commented.

“No, there is a dirt road there that hasn’t been used in years. Like over ten years.” Looking Jasper in the

eye, I was feeling rather confident that this plan would work.

“Is this what your 144 IQ is telling you is the best plan?” Jasper asked as the printer was printing out the blueprints.

“It is. I still feel like I am missing something but yeah, I feel like this is good.”

Jasper pulled out the blueprints and laid them out. It came out on multiple sheets of paper so he taped them together. It was large enough that I had to stand to see it all.

“Mark the areas where the rogue attack was and where each location has been found.” It might have sounded rather bit chy but I doubt either of them even noticed my tone.

Jasper took some push pins and placed one where the tunnel was found. Moving to the other side of the blueprints, he marked the rogue attack. I had to bend down a little to point out the location of where Alec and I were when that picture was taken.

Just staring at the blueprints, I was a little confused. Well, not sure confused was completely correct but I just didn’t understand why they would put a tunnel there. Would it be just as simple as one on each side so they could attack from both? In reality, it felt like the person in the picture was just seeing what was all around. Scoping out the land. Looking to see how far the nearest building was. (1)

The problem was, both areas were about the same distance to any building. Honestly, in a wolf territory, the most important building is the packhouse. It is where the Alpha works out of. Has the most sensitive information and is the center of the whole territory. When someone goes to attack pack lands, their whole goal is to take down the packhouse. Everything else will fall after that falls.







###Chapter 204
It would have taken them years to dig out those tunnels. Alpha Rip would have had to been planning this long before Darin met me. Maybe this wasn’t fully about me like we thought. They could have just been making us focus on me as a distraction. It could make sense, if everyone was focused on keeping me safe, their attention would be taken off other things.

“Kris? What is it?” Jasper asked. I didn’t realize he was looking at me confused. Emmy had even stood up and was scrunching her eyebrows at me.

“You figured something out.” It was more of a statement than a question.

“Maybe.” I didn’t really elaborate. “Alpha Marc, can you come to my office, please?” I asked him in the mind-link.

“On my way.” He said instantly. There had to be a secret that I was not familiar with and I honestly didn’t know if Jasper even knew it.

“Wha-” A knock on the door made Jasper and Emmy’s heads to snap around. Jasper’s b*dy was stiff as he walked over to answer the door.

“What is it?” Alpha Marc shoved past Jasper and came up to me. He looked down at the blueprint and frowned.

“This wasn’t making sense to me. This is where we found the tunnel. Over here is where the rogues attacked and this is where the other picture was taken.” I motioned to each push pin as I couldn’t extend

my arms out to point.

“Yeah?”

“It would have taken years for Alpha Rip to dig these tunnels. Years. He would have had to go slow in order to avoid being detected and to cut tree roots out of the way without killing the trees. He must have started this long before I came around. These spots are equal or similar distance to the packhouse. They aren’t quite in line for directly across from eachother. I think there might be a third tunnel around here. However, my point is, it looks like Alpha Rip has been planning this attack years ago. I think they are using me as a distraction from his main goal. I think Alpha Rip has something else he wants but is hoping you don’t realize it as you are trying to protect me form Darin.”

Alpha Marc was silent for awhile. His eyes darted between each pin point and finally over to where a third location could it. It would make a triangle with the packhouse directly in the middle. He put his hands on the desk and leaned forward as if he was studying it, intently.

1 looked up to see Emmy and Jasper both flabbergasted about this whole ordeal. Emmy had her hands

before morphing into annoyance.

“What is your plan for evacuating the women, child and elderly?” Alpha Marc said after a few more minutes. Standing up, he stood up tall as if he was just ignoring what I told him.

I was a little puzzled but I still answered his question. “W-we were thinking about using the old dirt road on the back side of your territory. Take a long way as they are probably watching the direct routes.”

“Okay. We can move forward with your plan. Our troops are getting assembled in preparation. Jasper, you need to head down and do the same.” Alpha Marc quickly walked about of my office, leaving us all speechless.

“What just happened?” I whispered to Jasper.

“He didn’t like what you had to say.” Jasper looked at the open door.

“He’s hiding something.” I said quietly. Jasper nodded in response.

“Do you have to leave?” Emmy looked up at Jasper with worry in her eyes.

“I do. You girls stay here. Alec will be up shortly. I will tell me what happened here but I do need to go.” Jasper spoke directly to Emmy. His hand landed on her swollen belly. “Be safe.” noveldrama

A tear fell down Emmy’s face. “We love you.” She whispered as he k*ssed her gently. I felt like I was intruding on a private matter. They were lost in each other’s eyes for a moment before Jasper briskly out of my office. Emmy’s eyes followed him out before she walked over to close the door and lock it.







###Chapter 205
Turning around, she looked at me and sighed. “What now?”

“Make a list. We will have waves of people being transported. I need to let them know a number. Keep the families together and figure out how many cars we can take at a time.”

“I can do that.” As much as I loved Emmy, I needed another set of hands.

“Alec?” I had to mind-link him as I wasn’t sure how to call him.

“What? I am finishing something up and I’ll be right up. Jasper just gave me a quick rundown.”

“I need Penny’s help with these plans.”

“I’ll give Colt a call and tell him to call the office directly. Is that okay?” Alec was trying to keep his anger from being transferred to me.

“Thank you.” I said simply and ended that conversation. “Emmy, can you take these things off me?” I

asked.

“Of course.” It took her a second to stand up and come up to me. It was uncomfortable to have them pulled over my head but once they were off, it was much easier. “Are you okay?” She asked as she set them on the floor. The phone started ringing.

“Penny?” I asked as I picked up the phone.

“No, it’s Colt. What’s up?”

“I need Penny’s help. We only have a short time before we start sending people over and…”

“Alec filled me in. He said Jasper told him we were going to start when the battle started.” Colt

interrupted. He sounded far away.

“Correct. I need another set of hands. I need Penny to make sure each vehicle arrives on time and with

the correct number of people. I will email you both the information but I need her to confirm everything.”

“We don’t have much time. You need to get our brain working and figure this s hit out.” Colt said as my office door opened and Alec walked in. He was completely drenched in sweat and looked anger as f uck.

“I’m trying.” I said matching his annoyance.

“I’ll give Penny a call and tell her to be watching out for you. I’ll give her this number so she can call. Write

the number down as it is the number to our house. I have to go.”

“Okay, Colt?” I said quickly before he hung up on me.

“What?”

“Be careful. I-I love you.”.

“Now isn’t the time for you to start having a heart.” Colt joked at me. He even gave me a little chuckle as he talked. “Love you too, sis.” He said before he hung up.

“Tell me what happened.” Alec said as his hands were clenched on our desk. He was leaning forward and impatiently waiting for me to get off the phone. Alec was failing at keeping his anger in check and Emmy was trying to stay away from him. His alpha aura was affecting her.

“Look.” I stood up and carefully pointed to each pushpin. “These are the locations. They aren’t as directly across the pack as I thought. If you put another pin here, it makes a perfect triangle. Making it the perfect place for another attack spot. The pack house would be directly in the middle. Furthermore, these tunnels would have taken years to dig. Not months and certainly not in the time I first ran into Darin. This has been planned long before I came around. Alpha Rip has been planning this for a long time. I think he is using Darin as a distraction. By making us believe that Darin is wanting to kidnap me, he is keeping your attention focused on that.”

“He did kidnap you.” Alec responded as if he was trying to wrap his head around this.






###Chapter 206
“Yes but I was honestly left alone for a long as time. There was only like three different times I even saw Darin or Alpha Rip. Believe me, I remember exactly what he said and did to me but thinking back, I don’t know. I’m tell you, something else is going on here. Something much bigger than Darin wanting me.”

Alec stared into my eyes. “What did dad say?”

“He completely ignored me and asked me what the evacuation plan was.”

“F uck.” Alec sat up and put his hands on top of his head.

“What did you find?” I asked.

“We found two tunnels. The only reason we found the second on was because a warrior watched a rat climb out of it. They are about a five miles long. Empties into a random place in the woods outside of our territory. The doors are wooden and covered in vines. No way in hell anyone would know they were there. We probably walked acrossed it multiple times and never known.”

“If you need to go find the third, it’s okay.” I said with no expression.

Alec looked at me, torn. I could feel his stress and indecisiveness. He wanted to stay with me but he needed to check his pack’s safety. “I promised I wouldn’t leave you.”

“You aren’t leaving me. I am telling you to go make sure our pack is safe.”

“Will you be okay?” Alec walked over to me and put his hands on either side of my face. “Don’t lie to me. I know how uneasy you feel right now.”

“Yes I am uneasy and I am still jumpy but we need to make sure our pack is safe. I’ll be okay. I promise.”

“I’ll be quick.” Alec k*ssed my forehead.

“I’ll hold you to that.” I whispered as he went to leave. He turned and smiled at me before walking out.

“I have the list of all those who needs to leave.” Emmy said after Alec left.

“Perfect. How many are there.” I asked. The phone started ringing.

“Kristen.” I answered. noveldrama

“It’s me.” Penny’s voice came through my ear.

“Perfect. Can you help us get this organized?” I asked and put her on speakerphone.

“Of course. I have our safe houses getting set up. Everyone will gather in one place. Both packs will fit just

“Okay, Colt?” I said quickly before he hung up on me.

“What?”

“Be careful. I-I love you.”

“Now isn’t the time for you to start having a heart.” Colt joked at me. He even gave me a little chuckle as he talked. “Love you too, sis.” He said before he hung up.

“Tell me what happened.” Alec said as his hands were clenched on our desk. He was leaning forward and impatiently waiting for me to get off the phone. Alec was failing at keeping his anger in check and Emmy was trying to stay away from him. His alpha aura was affecting her.

“Look.” I stood up and carefully pointed to each pushpin. “These are the locations. They aren’t as directly across the pack as I thought. If you put another pin here, it makes a perfect triangle. Making it the perfect place for another attack spot. The pack house would be directly in the middle. Furthermore, these tunnels would have taken years to dig. Not months and certainly not in the time I first ran into Darin. This has been planned long before I came around. Alpha Rip has been planning this for a long time. I think he is using Darin as a distraction. By making us believe that Darin is wanting to kidnap me, he is keeping your attention focused on that.”

“He did kidnap you.” Alec responded as if he was trying to wrap his head around this.







###Chapter 207
“Yes, it is.” I said before we hung up.

“I think I have it set up. Each van holds six. However, we are going to try to shove eight or more depending on size. I drew a line under each section. If we have three vans and Penny sends us some…”

“This will still take us hours.” I concluded. Emmy nodded as she emailed over her list to Penny.

“What do we do now?” Emmy asked.

“I guess I need to mind-link the entire pack and tell them to gather at the front of the packhouse in twenty minutes.” I hadn’t done this yet and I’m not sure I know how.

“Yeah, make sure you put some authority and urgency in it.” Emmy looked at me with concern.

Nodding, I prepared myself. Closing my eyes, I focused on expanding and opened my mind-link to the

entire pack. “Attention everyone! We will be evacuating all women, child and elderly that are unable to defend themselves. Report to the front of the packhouse in twenty minutes.” I commanded. I was met

with a series of ‘yes, luna’ before I closed it.

“Was that okay?” I asked Emmy.

“Yeah. That go the point across.”

“I guess we need to head down there and be ready.” I said the words but my feet didn’t move.

“I’ll stay beside you.” Emmy held out her hand to me.

“Thank you.” Taking a deep breath, I took her hand and we walked out into the hallway. The entire

atmosphere was completely different. It was panic and chaos. More than once, we were bumped into as

we made our way to the foyer by people`running around.

“Everyone listen!” I heard Alec speak with so much authority that I was even surprised. This is the first

time I heard him speak this way. “Make sure you have all your required equipment. Double check

everything!” We walked into the foyer and Alec immediately saw me. We made eye contact before he

continued on. “Review the plans and pee if you need to. It will be hours before you are allowed to do so.”

We stopped walking and stood in the back. Everyone was shoulder to shoulder as they moved around

and tightened straps on each other backs. Dressed in all black, their combat clothes looked lethal. Most

had face coverings that were pushed down around their necks. Others just had painted some black and

green around their faces.

Alec came around to us. “What are you doing?”

པ

+15 BONUS “Going to the foyer to put people in the correct order.” I said with a little shakiness. This was the first time I was being seen by the pack and I was getting sympathy looks from pretty much everyone.

“Come on.” Alec took my hand and walked us to the front door and out into the porch. He had changed into black combat pants and had a spandex black long sleeve shirt on. His face had some green and black paint on it.

“I thought you weren’t going.” I said looking at him.

“I’m not, I am prepared just in case there is something happening here.” Alec answered without looking at me. There was already a few people in the distance walking to the pack house. “I have four vans coming to transport people. There wasn’t any SUVs left.”

“That is fine. I figured as much.”

“You are doing great.” Alec said without looking at me.

“I’m still missing something and we both know who knows what that is.” noveldrama

“Leave it to me. You focus on getting everyone out of here.” Alec said.

“Kristen!” Luna Erin came out of the packhouse in a run.

“Mom.” Alec said with a clear annoyance.

“I’m here to help.” She said giving Alec an annoyed look.

The vans pulled around. “Penny is sending more vans as well. They are traveling the road to make sure it

is safe.” I said to Alec, ignoring Luna Erin.

“That is good. It will speed it up.”

“Emmy, why don’t you and Luna Erin start sorting people out into their groups. Assign them a place to

stand and wait.” I told Emmy.






###Chapter 208
“Will do.” More people were starting to show up and it will be quicker if we do it a little at a time and not wait until everyone is here to start.

“Tell me everything is going to go as planned.” I whispered to Alec. He let go of my hand and put his arm around me.

“Better than planned.”

“Alec.” Alpha Marc said with a very authoritive voice. Both Alec and I stiffened.

“What?” Alec asked looking around. His dad was standing in the door frame.

“We need you inside.” Alpha Marc didn’t wait and answer before he walked back in.

“We need to figure it out before anyone dies.” I said in the mind-link.

“Agreed.” Alec replied as he walked inside.

Turning back around, I watched as Emmy and Luna Erin sort everyone. Some where confused and others looked rather scared. Little kids were getting scolded for not staying in one place. Men kept coming in and out of the packhouse. I’m not sure what they know or what Alec or Alpha Marc told them but all of

them made sure to keep a distance from me. I, both, appreciated and was annoyed over this. Maybe if I was treated normally I would get over it quicker? Although, it could make my recovery longer.

Holding my arms in the other, it put some pressure off my shoulders. Still, they were feeling better than

they did this morning. However, if I wanted to be treated normally, I should probably start acting like it.

That meant allowing Alec to do what he needed to do to keep the pack safe.

Walking back inside the packhouse, it was an organized chaos. Men were adjusting their gear, saying

goodbye to their crying mates or having some internal pep talk. I saw Alec in the far corner talking to

some men. His back was to me but the men he was talking to glanced over and saw me. He got Alec’s

attention and motioned towards me. Confused, Alec glanced over and did a double take before telling

them he would be right back.

“Kristen?” He walked over and pulled me to the side. “What’s wrong?”

“Everyone is avoiding me. No one will talk to me or keeping a healthy distance.”

Alec looked even more confused. “I know. I thought that would be best so make it more comfortable for

you, Kristen, I am really busy right now.”

“I know, please listen.” I reached out and firmly grabbed his arm. It was quicker than I meant to do and it

finding it really off putting. I realized if I want to move on, I need everyone to treat me like they would have before the incident.” I was aware that there was more than one pair of ears listening in. “I need to feel normal in my own house. Normal means not being attached to you. Alec, I can’t hold you back from going. If you need to be with our men as they go into battle, go. I will be okay. I’m a survivor and this will not break me either. If you need to go… go!” I looked deep into his eyes to make sure he understood and I really meant it.

“I love you for this and I am happy to hear you are ready to accept going back to normal but someone has to stay here and make sure things are okay.”

“We both know someone else who would benefit from having their mate stay.” I was talking about Jasper. Emmy was pregnant and as much as she was keeping it together, Jasper would be a wreck not knowing what is going on back home. He trusted Alec to keep Emmy safe but it isn’t the same if it wasn’t him.

“Are you sure?” noveldrama






###Chapter 209
“Positive. Go be the leader they need you to be.” Letting go of his arm, I moved it to his face. The movement hurt but I wanted to feel his face one last time in case things didn’t go as planned.

Alec didn’t respond but leaned down and k*ssed me hard. It was a goodbye k*ss. As much as the tears threatened to fall, I wasn’t going to let it. I was the dam n luna of this pack and that meant keeping my s hit together for our men. He finally let me go and looked into my eyes.

“I love you, Kristen.”

“I love you, too, Alec.” I said firmly and without hesitation. He gave me one last k*ss before walking over to his men and to Jasper. I stood back and watched the shock on Jasper’s face before he looked over at me. Alec walked away from Jasper but Jasper just stood their with his mouth open, looking at me.

“MEN!” Alec roared. Everyone stopped talking and looked over at him, me included. “Let’s roll.” His voice was dangerous as he gave me one last look and walked out the door. Everyone fallowed him. Walking out after the last guy, I watched them get into our blacked out SUVs. Only when the last door was shut, did Alec get into his seat and shut the door. Everyone around stopped what they were doing and watched the SUVS leave the territory.

Penny’s vans had arrived just moments after our SUVs left. Walking out, I needed to meet them and talk to them before we load up. The sky was darkening and the air was starting to cool off. noveldrama

“Luna Kristen. It’s good to see you.” One of my dad’s warriors stepped out. His daughter was in my class.

His name was Clint and was still one hell of a warrior.

“Hey, how are you?” I asked as I got close to him but stopped when I was within arms reach.

“I am doing well, I should be asking you that question.” Clint had a sympathetic look on his face.

“You know me, stubborn as hell and refuse to accept help.” I joked.

Clint laughed. “I remember.”

“So, how is the road?” I asked getting to business.

“We drove slow and Penny even had us leave a few warriors every so often to keep monitoring it. They are to check in every ten minutes.” Clint held up a walkie talkie. “There doesn’t appear to be any fresh

tracks or any signs of human interaction.”

“Perfect. I shouldn’t need to tell you the importance of this.” I said firmly.

“No, ma’am. I will be greeting Penny myself. Penny got the email you sent but she still wishes that your

I both loved and missed Penny. “She is an angel.” I sighed.

“She will be a perfect luna.” Clint agreed.

“Emmy, write down the names of each person in each car. Start loading them up.” I yelled out. Emmy nodded and guided people into the vehicles. Everyone moved in a hurried fashion. “Clint, minimal information has been handed out to limit panic. I would appreciate it to stay that way until everyone is safe inside the safe house Penny has set up.”

“Understood.” Clint looked at his watch. “I believe Colt should be meeting up with Alpha Alec within five minutes.”

“Clint, tell me everything is going to go smoothly and I am over reacting.”

“Well, everything is going to go smoothly but you can never be too safe with the lives of your pack. I believe you are doing the right thing.”

I didn’t respond but nodded as people headed towards his van. He opened the door as I watched parents sit in the seats and all children sat on their laps or on the floor. They all looked scared.

“Everything is going to be okay. Clint here is going to make sure you arrive safely.” I told them as Clint

went to shut the door.







###Chapter 210
“Luna?” A mother asked quickly.

“Yeah?” I looked in the back. Her daughter was only around a year old and had a death grip on her mother.

“Where are we going?”

“You are going to Alpha Brian and Alpha Colt’s pack. My twin brother is Colt. It is the pack I grew up in. Penny is Colt’s mate. She will greet you there and move you all to a safe house where you will stay until we can guarantee your safety here.”

She didn’t ask anything back but nodded as she tried to sooth her child. Clint nodded and shut the door. ” Here.” Emmy walked up to me with a list of names. We had managed to get 65 people in these vans. I knew they were crammed but comfort isn’t my priority.

Signing the paper, I handed it to Clint. “Drive safe. Drive fast but be safe.”

“Here is a walkie talkie for you to follow along. I will announce when we made it.” Clint handed me one before getting in and shut the door. Stepping back, the vans took off but turned in a different direction.

My eyes landed on the pack members that were just standing around, waiting for instructions. “Thank you everyone for coming promptly. The vans will be dropping them off and coming back for another wave. Please have a seat and relax as it will be a little while before they get back. If anyone needs any food or anything please let one of us know.”

“Jasper?” I heard Emmy whisper. She looked over at me.

“Your needs are greater than mine.” I gave her a small smile as she looked over at him. It started as a

walk but eventually she ran over to him and jumped in his arms.

“That was a nice thing you did for her.” Luna Erin came up to me.

“It was the right thing to do.” I replied. My heart both ached for Alec and happy to see that I took some of

the stress off Emmy and her baby.

A few more minutes went by of us just standing around outside before the walkie talkie went off. “Check

point one, all confirm.” I heard Clint talk.

“Isaac normal.”

+15 BONUS This went on for another twelve men. Each one confirmed their presence. It was only able to breath when Clint finally announced his arrival. It took about five minutes to confirm each pack member and for them

to turn around and head back.

“One down.” Luna Erin stated.

By the time the vans showed back up, it was pitch black. There was still come kids running around playing and some had fallen asleep. Overall, everyone had started relaxing and not being as worried. They had the privilege of being in the dark about what was going on. However, that is how I wanted it. They didn’t need to until they were safe.

Emmy put another round of people on the vans. After signing the paper, they took off again. Owls were hooting in the distance and everything felt really calm. Emmy and Jasper were sitting on the steps, looking up at the sky. There was different warriors positioned around, walking back and forth.

“Jasper, when was the attack suppose to happen?” I asked in the mind-link.

“11pm.” He answered. Looking at my watch, it was 10:34pm. There was still thirty minutes before they made their move. Probably sitting in the dark, waiting for the right moment to achieve this.

“Did anyone ever go look for the third tunnel?” I asked.

“No, they had to leave before we could go. However, we don’t even have a location on where to start.” Jasper was speaking reasonably but it still caused me a sense of anxiety to not know. It was too dark to really being able to look appropriately.

“Any word from Alec?”

“Not yet. I’ll let you know when I do.” I glanced over at him. He was looking at me but I couldn’t see his face. “How do you feel?”






###Chapter 211
“Ask me again when Alec is home.”

The vans were driving fast enough that it was taking them about thirty-five minutes to make a trip. Emmy had another load fill up quickly. Clint gave me a nod before he took off. Each person checked in like they

should. Each successful trip helped my anxiety.

However, I kept checking my watch every few minutes. It was driving me crazy not knowing what is going

Luna Erin seemed to be relaxed and just chatting away with the remaining pack members. Each time

the walkie talkie went off, my heart sk ipped a beat.

“Luna.” I heard Jasper come up behind me as I stared into the black woods.

“What?” I didn’t even turn around. He came up and stood beside me but didn’t touch me. However, he

was close enough his arms could.

“You are literally jumping at everything. Alec and the warriors will be okay. They will get in, get it done and

get out before anyone knew what happened.”

Looking at my watch, it was 10:59. Emmy was loading up another round of pack members. “I hope so.”

“What else is bothering you?” Jasper sounded like he was honestly worried about me.

“We aren’t seeing the whole picture.”

“You think we are making a mistake?” He whispered as he moved to stand directly in front of me.

“No, not that. Think about it.” I took his arm and moved him away from everyone. We lowered our voices

so even with their wolf hearing, no one would hear. “What could Alpha Marc have that Alpha Rip has spent years finding a way to attack here so precisely?”

Jasper’s eyes darkened. “I don’t know.”

“Alec agrees. Something is going on here and until we figure out what it is, we are still in danger.”

“What do you think we should do?”

“You’re not going to like it.” I warned.

“What is it?” Jasper had his arms folded over his chest. Looking over, Luna Erin was still talking to

different pack members.

“Sneak into his office and look around,”

This went on for another twelve men. Each one confirmed their presence. It was only able to breath when Clint finally announced his arrival. It took about five minutes to confirm each pack member and for them

to turn around and head back.

face. “How do you feel?”







###Chapter 212
“Not too much. I’ll start in the filing cabinet.” Jasper said. I could hear the cabinet open with the screech of rusted metal rubbing against more metal. “He has a file for every ranking pack member in here.”

That didn’t fully surprise me but it did a little. Most alphas would do some sort of background check on their members. “That isn’t too crazy.” I said, unsure.

“Your file has different reports of your IQ testing you took as a child.”

“WHAT?” I was completely appalled.

“Yeah, this is a copy of an IQ test that looks like you had it done when you were seven.” Jasper confirmed. He was right. I did have one done then.

“What else is in there?”

“There is a list of your family tree, positions of each person and what not.”

“He had all this in a file cabinet?” I clarified.

“It was locked. Your folder isn’t that interesting. Just basic stuff.” Jasper sounded like he put it back and was shifting through it.

“I know we don’t have a time crunch but keep looking.” I said, pushing Jasper to move on.

“He has a file on Alpha Rip.” Jasper said after a moment.

My curiosity got the best of me. “What does it say?”

“He also has a family tree but some of the names are blacked out.”

“Take a picture of it.” I said quickly.

“He has some serious knowledge of his pack. It has member numbers, square footage of the territory and even the pack house. S hit! He even knows their boarder patrol routine.”

“Are you serious?” I was blown away. “He would have to have a spy for him to know that.”

“I know. It doesn’t say how long he has had this information.” Jasper said almost to himself than to me.

The vans were pulling up again. Right on time again as the pack stood up and waited for them to park We were getting closer to the end, which made me happy. Emmy helped them in once again. After signing the paper, the vans took off.

Emmy went back to sitting on the steps and Luna Erin sat down beside her. My heart ski pped a beat for a

I’ll explain later.”

“Okay.” Emmy asked Luna Erin what she all had planned for my luna ceremony. This really got her talking.

“Find anything else?” I asked, Jasper.

“I look a picture of some budget stuff but nothing that is sticking out at me. His computer is password protected and turned off so I can’t access that.”

I was a little annoyed there wasn’t more. “Anything on the floor like a trapped door or anything?”

Jasper didn’t respond but I could hear him move stuff around. “I’m looking but I really don’t see much.” Jasper finally said after a few minutes.

I saw Luna Erin stand up and Emmy glance over at me. “Get out! Jasper, get out!”

“S hit!” Jasper said but it sounded like he ran into something. He groaned but I heard the door click shut. Thankfully, that was right as Luna Erin walked in.

“Oh! Jasper! You startled me!” Jasper managed to greet her right as she was about to close the packhouse door.

“My apologies, Luna Erin. I was just using the restroom.”

“You have been in there for awhile, is everything okay?” Jasper had the mind-link still open so I was able

to listen.

“My stomach is upset. I don’t think lunch agreed with me.”

“Is that why Alec switched with you?” Luna Erin asked. noveldrama

“Yeah, we didn’t want to risk me s hitting my pants while we were out there.” Jasper took one for the

team.

“It has nothing to do with Kristen telling Alec to go and leave you behind?” Well s hit.

“What are you asking, Luna? Are you suggesting that I was too scared to go or something?” Jasper

sounded rather annoyed.

“Oh no, I was just wondering why you two switched places. Kristen is in a very sensitive emotional state

and I’m concerned for her wellbeing.”







###Chapter 213
“Oh. I think Luna Kristen is handling her trauma very well. She is out there still doing what she needs to do for our pack. She isn’t thinking about herself right now and I think that shows how brave she is.” Jasper stood up for me.

“Suppressing trauma isn’t healthy either.” Luna Erin said quietly. “She has been pacing around and jumping at every single sound.”

“I can’t say I blame her for that. I would expect anyone to be that way after being kidnapped. You heard her recording.”

“Yes, I did…. Just keep a close eye on her. Will you?” Luna Erin said. Her voice sounded like she was walking away from Jasper.

Jasper walked out and closed the door as the vans came back around. He walked up to me as Emmy got up and started loading the vans again. He gave me a look but didn’t say anything. Instead, we watched as everyone climbed in. There was still one more load to go and we hadn’t heard anything yet. Jasper picked up his phone and looked at it. Nothing. I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or bad.

“How long should the mission have lasted?” I asked as the vans drove off.

“Hard telling. Depends on if they ran into any complications.”

“What if it all went correctly?”

“Not sure. Maybe thirty minutes to an hour. We weren’t sure the layout completely and what was all

inside. They might have found something that caused the plan to shift.”

“Colt went with them.” I stated.

“Yes.” Jasper glanced down at me.

“And my dad…”

“Yes.” Jasper answered again.

“So, Jacob is watching the pack there.”

“And most of their warriors.” Jasper sighed.

“Are you sending Emmy with the last group of people?” I asked looking up at him.

Jasper looked down at me intently. “What about me? Emmy walked up to us and sl*pped under Jasper’s

armi.

“Kristen asked if you were going to go on the last group of people going over.” Jasper filled in for her.

“Oh!” Emmy looked surprised.

“I wasn’t sure if you would feel safer there. With everything going on, I wouldn’t be upset if you wanted to go. It might even give our pack a familiar face to make it more comfortable.”

“Do you think I should go?” Emmy looked up at Jasper.

“I want you save. I want our baby safe.” Jasper responded after a moment.

“We don’t know how long they will even be over there for.” Emmy looked down. “I might be away from you for days if not weeks!”

“I doubt it would be that long but he would be able to visit you.” I promised.

“Maybe it’s not a bad idea.” Jasper looked down at her.

“I’ll give you guys some privacy to talk about it.” I said as I walked away. I was needing to sit down. My shoulders were hurting and so were my feet. Sitting down on the step, I just stared off into the stars. It wasn’t until the vans show up again that I snapped out of my trans.

Standing up, I watched as the rest of our pack members got into the van. Jasper walked Emmy over and put her in the front seat next to Clint. After everyone was in, Jasper shut the doors.

“Is that all of it?” Clint asked.

“I believe so. Thank you for doing this.” I said.

“It is my pleasure. This was smooth sailing so far. One last trip and we are done. I’ll have Alpha Colt pick up the walkie talkie at a later date. That way you can still hear we made it okay.”

“Thank you so much.” I said as Clint got into the drivers seat.

“Be safe!” Emmy leaned forward and yelled at me. noveldrama

“You too.” I gave her a little wave before taking a few steps back and watched as the vans drove out of sight for the last time.

“This sucks.” Jasper sighed as he put his hands on his hips.

“Agreed” Turning around, I walked up the stairs and sat down on the porch swing. Jasper followed me but stopped short of sitting down beside me.






###Chapter 214
“Not going to bed?”

“Are you going to be sleeping until they get back?” I asked like it was a st upid question.

“Guess not.” Jasper looked beside me. I stopped the swing and scooted over so he could sit beside me but still not touch me.

“Still nothing from them?” I asked even though I already knew the answer.

“Nope.”

We fell into a comfortable silence as different warriors came up to the porch and sat down. No one was sleeping tonight until the guys came back. However, no one said a word either. We just sat in silence, listening to the frogs croak and the owls hoot.

At one point, I rested my head against the chain and closed my eyes. I started picturing what my tattoo shop would look like once I got it back. To say I missed it was an understatement. That shop meant everything to me. There was a wave of energy as my wolf came back to me. It was weird, like my b*dy woke up. I felt more alive, more energetic and more…

“Kristen.” Jasper pushed my leg, getting my attention.

“What?” I asked opening my eyes instantly.

He nodding towards the road as I started to hear the sounds of engines. My neck cracked a few times as I looked over. Sure enough, our black SUVs slowly made their way to the packhouse. The warriors slowly stood up but it was me who got up and ran to the top of the stairs. As the doors opened and the

men started exiting, my eyes scanned for Alec. I couldn’t gage the mood. No one was smiling or crying. No one seemed to be covered in blood or carrying a b*dy.

Finally, they landed on the most beautiful shade of green I have ever seen. Alec slide out of the passenger side and looked right at me. The relief I felt was consuming. Closing my eyes, I had to take a couple deep breaths to calm my heart. As he walked around the SUV, I ran down the rest of the stairs and into his

open arms.

He was holding me tightly. With one arm around my shoulders and the other around my head, he k*ssed me a few times on my forehead before resting his cheek against me. The pressure was painful on my shoulders but I didn’t give a f uck. Feeling the sparks all over my b*dy was taking away all the anxiety ! felt. Even though my arms weren’t around him, they still held on tightly to his shirt. This man was my everything. My rock. My soul.

“Well?” I heard a warrior ask.

“Everything went exactly according to plan. They didn’t expect a thing and it went off without a hitch.” Alpha Marc said triumphantly.

All the warriors started cheering and howling up at the moon. I was so incredibly thankful for this.” Jasper.” I heard Alec say.

“All’s good, man.” Jasper walked over and I felt Alec let go of my head and shake Jasper’s hand.

“Thank you.” He said sincerely. I could feel how much he meant it.

“Anytime.” Jasper answered before I heard him start to walk away.

“Jasper?” I peaked out from behind Alec’s arm.

“What?”

“Come to our room.” I said simply without saying what I wanted to. I knew Alec was confused but thankfully he didn’t question it.

Jasper looked at me for a second before nodding. He reached down and took Alec’s bag. Alec’s arm didn’t leave my b*dy as he moved me to his side and followed Jasper. We were the last of the warriors to come inside the packhouse. Everyone was making their way to their rooms but was being rather quiet about it. We didn’t talk either until we were in our bedroom and the door was locked. noveldrama

“What’s going on?” Alec asked as he went over to the couch and set me down.

“Show him.” I said to Jasper.






###Chapter 215
Chapter 0215 “Show me what?” Alec stripped his shirt off and tossed it in the corner. Jasper sighed and sat down. “First off, it was Kristen’s idea and I just did what I was told.” Jasper put his hand on his head like he knew he was going to get yelled at. Alec frowned and went to the closet. I could hear him take his pants off before he came out with shorts on. Ignoring us, he went to the bathroom and washed his face. Only when he came back out, did he finally speak to us. “What happened?” Sitting down next to me, he pulled me tightly against him. “I kept thinking about what your dad was hiding…” Suddenly, it felt like a bad idea. “Okay?” Alec looked down at me. “No one was inside, I had everyone outside and lined up for the transport. You had most of the warriors with you.” I looked at Jasper. “She had me look around your dad’s office for anything suspicious.” Jasper filled in quickly. “You what?” Alec looked between us, completely shocked. “We both know he is hiding something. Your mom was acting incredibly strangle too. I saw an opportunity and took it.” Alec was quiet for a few minutes. His emotions were feeling a little bit of everything. Shock, anger, confusion, relief and maybe even a little proudness? “Did you find something?”

Jasper nodded and pulled out his phone. He found the picture and handed Alec his phone. Alec pulled his arm out from behind me and sat forward. Enlarging the picture, Alec’s b*dy froze as he read it. He even fl*pped over a couple different pictures before looking at me. “Does your dad have a spy at Alpha Rip’s pack?” I asked pointedly. Alec looked at me and opened his mouth and looked back at the phone. “I don’t know.” “What happened tonight? Why isn’t everyone more excited? The mood was almost somber.” Jasper leaned forward.

Alec looked up at Jasper. “Something just felt off. No one was there. We expected someone to be there but nope, it was all empty. There was a layer of dust on everything that said it had been empty for white We were able to get in, set the bombs and get out. They went off as expected. There was no guards or any type of security.” +15 BONUS “That would be odd for a building that is supposeably a key money maker for them.” Jasper was frowning. “Was the information wrong?” I asked. “Dad never allowed me to have access to it. I have no idea and I just accepted what he told me.” Alec stood up and started walking around. “I wonder if my dad would know, or Colt.” I said as I looked at Jasper. “Possibly. It could just be that Alpha Marc had bad information.” Jasper played devil’s advocate. “Who all knows about this?” Alec asked. “Just us three.” I said quickly. Alec tossed Jasper his phone. “Where is Emmy?” “She went with the rest of the pack to my dad’s pack. Just in case we were attacked here.” I said quietly. Alec nodded. He was looking behind us with his hands on his hips. I couldn’t tell if he was mad at me or not. “Jasper, why don’t you go to bed. We can pick this up in the morning.” Jasper and I shared a look before he stood up. “Alright.” Alec held out his hand for Jasper to shake before he followed him out. Shutting the door behind him, Alec locked it and rested his head against it. He was trying to control his anger but I couldn’t tell if it was at me or not. “I’m sorry if I overstepped.” I said quietly after Alec didn’t come back to me. Alec pushed away from the wall and walked up to me. I kept my head held high as I wasn’t sorry I did it.” What if you were caught?” noveldrama

“Then I would push against him like I have done this entire time.” I said simply as Alec sat down on the other side of the couch. He was turned towards me but didn’t try to touch me. “We need to be smart about this moving forward. The fact that you asked that question to dad in our office means he knows we are suspicious of him. If he is hiding anything, he will be more likely to cover his tracts. If you were caught….” Alec shook his head and looked away. +15 BONUS







###Chapter 216
Chapter 0216 “Probably why he was pushing so hard for us to take a vacation and not get involved in his affairs.” I said ignoring his last part. “This whole thing feels off. I don’t think we made the impact we wanted to make.” Alec sighed and sat down beside me. This time, pulling me against him. “Tomorrow we need to look for the third tunnel. They need to be sealed off completely.” “I agree. I have cameras watching in case someone tries to use them.” Alec pulled me onto his lap and stood up. He carried me to our bed and gently put me down before rolling over me to his side. “How do you feel?” “Sore but okay.” I said as I snuggled into his chest. His arms wrapped around me, holding me close to him. It was only then that I fully allowed my b*dy to relax against him. His hand started rubbing my back as I closed my eyes. “Close your eyes. Go to sleep, my love.” Alec whispered in my ear. That was all I needed to give into the darkness. The next morning, I we woke up to his phone vibrating. My entire b*dy was laying on top of him with my head on his chest. His arms were folded behind his head and mine were resting on either side of him. When his phone started ringing, I realized how comfortable this position really was. Alec tried to move as little as possible and looking at the message he got. As much as I didn’t want to move, I sl*pped off of him so he could fully look at it. “Where are you going?” Alec grabbed my thigh with an arm, holding me from getting up.

“Going to pee.” I said looking back at him. He nodded and let me go. My shoulders were feeling so much better. I was able to list them over my head with minor stiffness. I was so happy for my advanced wolf healing abilities. After peeing, I took my shirt off and looked at myself in the mirror. The bruising was still impressive but it was all green and yellow. Some spots even started fading away. Deciding hot water would make my shoulders and my entire b*dy feel better, I got in the shower. It was only a few seconds before I heard

the bathroom door open. “Showering without me?” Alec said. His voice was thick with sleep still. “It was a spare of the moment decision. Figured the hot water would help loosen my muscles.” re aroun Alec sl*pped in behind me, instantly putting his hands on my hips. He turned me around so he could fully +15 BONUS “That would be odd for a building that is supposeably a key money maker for them.” Jasper was frowning. “Was the information wrong?” I asked. “Dad never allowed me to have access to it.

###Chapter 217
Chapter 0217 “Not like this.” Alec growled and pulled my head off his d ick. Shutting the water off, he picked me up and carried me to the bed. We were dripping wet still but that didn’t stop him from placing me gently on the bed. My legs wrapped around him as he k*ssed me hard. His b*dy shuttered on top of me. “I’m okay.” I whispered when he stopped k*ssing me. His forehead was resting against mine but his d ick was pressing against my core. My b*dy was begging for his touch. “Are you sure? If it is too soon…” Alec stopped as I grabbed his face and k*ssed him hard. Grabbing his hand, I moved it to my breast while looking him in the eyes. “Touch me, Alec. I need you to make love to me. I need to feel this from you.” His eyes searched mine for a second before he started k*ssing my neck. With his fingers working their magic, I felt my b*dy shudder with need. His tongue moved down to my breast, spending equal amount of time tasting every inch of them. Moving to my sensitive spot under my breast, my back arched off the bed. His hair provided a great handle for me to hold onto as his head moved lower. As on instinct, my legs spread wider when he started k*ssing my thigh. I could feel his uneasiness as his tongue gently grazed over my cl it. His claws dug into my hips as I started rotating my hips on his face. One finger sl*pped inside me, causing an instant wetness to spread down his hand. noveldrama

“Oh, Alec!” I moaned as he added a finger and increased his speed. Between his tongue and his fingers, I was coming unglued. My b*dy started shaking with need. The pressure started building. My face was tingling but my eyes stayed on Alec. “Cu m for me.” Alec growled right as my or gasm hit. My hips buckled into him as my head tossed back. “OH! OH! YES!” I screamed as he kept going. When I started coming down, Alec pulled his finger out and moved up. Kissing me hard, his d ick

sl*pped into me. Filling me completely. Slowly he pulled out and pushed back in as he k*ssed me. Feeling rather adventurous, I pushed him to the side and rolled on top of him. Giving me full control. His hands rested on my hips as I grinded against him. His eyes watched as my pu ssy covered his di ck in my juice. Picking up my speed, I watched as Alec’s eyes rolled in the back of his head. My fangs erupted and I didn’t even wait for him to be ready. Instead, I leaned forward and sank them deep into his neck. His b*dy tensed under me as his claws dug into my hips. His or asm hit as the same time, allowing me to feel each rush of him shoot deep into me. The moment my teeth pulled out, he fl*pped me over and kept pounding into me. His own teeth were ready for action but he just kept pounding into me. +15 BONUS “A little stiff but not painful. Like how your muscles feel when you haven’t used them in awhile. Which reminds me, I haven’t worked out in weeks.” “Let’s wait till monday. You should start feeling normal by then.” Alec grabbed the shampoo and started washing my hair. “Hmm, that feels good.” I moaned and put my hands on his hips. “Don’t think about it.” Alec sighed but there was some amusement to his voice. “Think about what?” I plaid innocent. Pushing my b*dy against his, I let my harden nipples graze his chest. “You aren’t ready yet.” Alec pushed me under the water. “I’m ready for you.” I said honestly. I wanted his soft touch, I wanted to feel him love me. Alec grabbed the conditioner and started putting that in my hair. I took the chance and grabbed the b*dy wash and started soaping him and myself up. I grabbed his so I was bathing in his scent. The

soap made it easy to grab his di ck and slowly start to massage it. “F uck, Kristen.” Alec groaned and closed his eyes as he pushed up in the water again. This time, he put his head in the water and started washing his own hair as I rinsed out the conditioner. We switched places as Alec finished washing his hair, giving me full access to his di ck. With his eyes closed, I kneeled down and placed his di ck in my mouth. As soon as it went in, his entire b*dy jolted and his hand flew off his hand and grabbed the wall for support. He didn’t speak but his eyes opened and looked at me, full of lust. I kept eye contact with him as I moved him in and out. His other hand wrapped around my hair and steadied me as I worked his di k. +15 BONUS







###Chapter 218
“Maybe we do need to go on a vacation so we can stay in bed all day.” I groaned as I used my arms to get myself out of bed. Walking straight back to the bathroom, I needed to clean myself up. “I’m not against that idea.” Alec yelled from inside the closet. Rounding the corner, Alec was coming out of the closet as I went in. He was wearing basic gym shorts and a tank. I guess this wasn’t dress up kind of day. To be fair, the only people her right now are the warriors. Pulling a workout tank with a built in bra out of my dresser, I got the matching shorts and underwear. It was easy to sl*p those on but I needed help with my top. “Can you help me?” I asked. I could manage to get it over my head but the bra part was little tighter than I was able to pull down correctly. Alec walked over and helped me position my bra correctly before he slapped me on the as s. “Showing off your bruises?” Alec tossed me a pair of socks. “Might as well. I’m rising above.” I tried to sound confident but I wasn’t sure I got that across. “Have you got your wolf back yet?” Alec asked. “Last night.” Grabbing my shoes, I started putting them on.

“Right before you got back actually.” “Good. Then you should be healed by the end of the day.” Alec smiled at me. “That would be nice. I’m ready to feel normal again.” Alec walked over and opened the bedroom door. “I’m not sure you are going to feel normal for awhile.” I glared at him as I walked out. He shut the door and caught up with me since I didn’t stop and wait for him. “Tomorrow will be another rough/day and whatever happens after that.” Ah, I forgot about tomorrow. I wasn’t sure what to expect from dad. Would he be smiling? Crying? Maybe it will kill An n and that would solve all of our problems.

“Alec.” Alpha Marc yelled at us as we passed his office. Both of us stopped and looking into the office. we saw Luna Erin and a few warriors standing around. “What’s going on?” Alec asked as we walked in. The T.V. was showing the news and covering the destruction that they did last night. “Turn it up.” Alec said as he crossed his arms over his chest. +15 BONUS “… night around 11pm, people reported starting hearing an explosion before everything started shaking. The company, known as Midnight Mechanics was completely destroyed. The owner, Rip Thomas was unavailable for comment at this time. Fire crews have been trying to control the fire since they arrived on scene at 11:35pm. It is reported that they only just now got the fire under control. No known cause as of just yet. The only thing we do know at this time is no one was hurt as a result of the explosion. Alexis Grey, Channel 15 news.” I looked up at Alec. He had a very serious look on his face that was part rage. No one spoke for the longest time after watching that. I wasn’t even sure how to feel. It was almost like they didn’t do enough. This big impact wasn’t enough. Was it even a hit to them? Alpha Marc’s phone rang. “Alpha Marc.” He sighed and put his phone down before putting it on speakerphone. “What the f uck was that, Marc?” I was my dad. “All of the intel told us that was their major money source.” Alpha Marc sounded pis sed off. Not at dad but at the whole situation. “Who the f uck was your source? I trusted you would be able to avenge my daughter. Do I need to handle this one?” Some of the warriors glanced my way. “This isn’t over.” Alpha Marc spit. “This will be the last time I blindly trust your intel. You are making a mockery of things and I am not going to stand by and allow this!” I watched as Alpha Marc seemed to be spiraling. “She is in my pack and the decision will be mine!” Alpha Marc yelled. +15 BONUSnoveldrama






###Chapter 219
Chapter 0219 “And while she has been at your pack she has been kidnapped, shot at and photographed without her knowledge.” That was a low blow but I didn’t disagree. “You have one f ucking hour to inform me of how you are going to fix this! I want to speak with her right now!” “I’m here, dad.” I said firmly and loud enough to sound confident. “Kristen? Has your wolf come back yet?” “It has.” I confirmed. “Good. We will make sure they pay for what they did to you. Even if it is the last thing I do.” Dad spit out before he hung up. The last part confused me. Looking at Alec, we both knew he didn’t expect to live to see monday. Alec was just as confused as I was. “Warriors, let’s go find that other tunnel. Alpha Marc apparently has some s hit to figure out.” Alec said. His voice was full of venom. His eyes drilled holes into Alpha Marc before be turned and walked out of the room. I had to turn and jog to catch up. All the warriors followed us out of the house. No one spoke but I could feel their disapproval and annoyance.

Alec was on a mission as he walked out to the forest. I wasn’t even sure he knew where he was going.” Alec?” I asked quietly. “What?” He answered through gritted teeth. “Where are you going?” I asked simply. He stopped so suddenly that I completely bumped into him and bounced off. He had to catch me as I tripped over a log. Unfortunately, he grabbed my arm and yanked me up. “F UCK!” I yelled as I ripped my arm back and held it close. “S hit.” Alec muttered as he took a step towards me. “No.” I said and held up a finger. “You are going the wrong f ucking way.” I glared at him and turned to my left and started walking away. I could feel the regret in Alec but I also heard the men trying to stifle a laugh at Alec’s expense. Being pis sed was a welcoming feeling. I felt like I was getting my attitude back. Still, I didn’t say anything asnoveldrama

we walked around to the area on the map that there should be a tunnel. “Alright. Everyone spread out. Look for anything out of the normal.” Everyone listened instantly and started using their foot to move the vegetation around. “Kristen!” I heard Jasper yell my name. He was running to catch up with us. +15 BONUS “… night around 11pm, people reported starting hearing an explosion before everything started shaking. The company, known as Midnight Mechanics was completely destroyed. The owner, Rip Thomas was unavailable for comment at this time.

###Chapter 220
Chapter 0220 +15 BONUS “Jasper, be ready.” I whispered. That seemed to register with the men and they all became in a defensive stand. Alec took the phone and I watched his eyes shift to black quickly. Taking back Jasper’s phone and tossing it to him, I tried to keep Alec focused. “Alec! Look at me!” I grabbed his shoulder and shook him but he wasn’t really paying attention to me. “Luna! Get back!” I heard a few men yell. SLAP! My hand made contact with Alec’s face hard enough that he took a few steps back. It sent a jolt of pain through my arm but it wasn’t terrible. It did make me wince and drop my shoulder. His eyes snapped to mine. It took him a second to register my pain but when he did, I saw him fight back control over his wolf. Alec closed his eyes and I felt someone grabbed my arms and pull me back. Alec snapped his eyes open and glared at the warrior. “Don’t f ucking touch her.” He said in a low warning growl.

“Alec!” I stomped my foot to get his attention. “Calm down!” “THIS IS SO F UCKED UP! I’LL KILL HIM!” Alec roared. “No you won’t!” I walked over to him and grabbed his arm. He didn’t push me away but he stiffened up. We need to be smart about this. We don’t know the full picture and we don’t know what is going on.” “We are talking about your life here!” Alec yelled at me as he too a few steps back. “You could have died and still are in imminent danger! Kristen, they f ucking kidnapped you, touched you and beat you up! What did we do to retaliate? Blow up a f ucking useless building! Now this!” “I am very well aware of what happened to me. We have to be smart here. I am for killing them but we aren’t going to bust down their door. Don’t forget you have also been shot and they kill Ace. This is bigger than just me. Rip is planning something and we need to be prepared. Alpha Marc isn’t handling this. It’s time you put your foot down and do something about it.” I could feel my own wolf showing.

All the men around me nodded in agreement. “Luna’s right!” I heard one of them say. “We need to start with finding this third tunnel. Everyone spread out and get looking!” I yelled as I looked at Alec. He was staring at me, trying to control is breathing. “Jasper, text Alec that pictures” I mind-linked him. +15 BONUS “Jasper.” Alec said after a few moments. “Kristen and I need to have a word with my father. Keep me updated on their progress.” “Got it.” Jasper said a little too chipper before we started walking back to the pack house. Only when we were out of ear shot of the men, did Alec talk to me. “I’m sorry.” “It’s fine.” I said without looking at him. “It’s not.” Alec grabbed my waist and forced me to turn and look at him. “Kristen, I’m sorry.” “Sorry for what?” I asked, shifting my weight, I crossed my arms and looked at him. “Sorry my dad didn’t avenge you. Sorry I lost my temper back there. Sorry we are even in this mess.” Alec just shook his head. “We are in this together. We don’t focus on the past. We are looking at our future and protecting it. Right now, that starts with your dad.” As soon as I said those words, Alec’s eyes shifted to black for a second before going back to his beautiful green. “Come on.” He took my hand as we walked back to Alpha Marc’s office. +15 BONUSnoveldrama







###Chapter 221
Chapter 0221 “DAD!” Alec roared as he busted the office door open. I was surprised to see my dad sitting in his office. “Dad?” I asked, confused. “Kristen.” Dad got up and gave me a hug. His face was red with anger and I knew they were just arguing. “This is a private meeting, Alec.” Alpha Marc said firmly. “No. I am done allowing you to shut me out. I am done with standing by as you continue to make questionable decisions in regards to this pack and to my mate. I don’t know what you have got yourself into but this ends here.” Alec slammed his fist down on Alpha Marc’s desk. “What is he talking about?” Dad let me go and walked over to he was facing both Alec and Marc. It was a triangle of testosterone.

“Penny and Emmy were able to find out over the f ucking internet that that mechanical shop was being sold and was just an empty building. That whole attack was worthless! Not only did we not avenge Kristen but we lost the upper hand! Now he knows we are coming for him!” “All of my intel told me that building was operational and one of their biggest assets!” Alpha Marc roared back. “Who the f uck gives you your intel because clearly it is wrong.” Alec spit back. “None of your concern.” Alpha Marc said in a dangerously low tone. “You said the phone was linked to that building and you had been watching him for awhile. Why?” I asked. Alec didn’t move so I was still hidden behind Alec but dad looked at him and waited a reply. “He has never been an ally! I watch all my enemies!” Alpha Marc shrugged off my question. “Where is Gam ma Judd?” I asked quickly. Alpha Marc’s b*dy tensed up before he tried to relax it. It did not go unnoticed by Alec or by my dad. ” Away on assignment.” noveldrama

“Is he undercover at Alpa Rip’s pack?” Alec just bluntly asked the question. “Why would you ask that?” Alpha Marc got red in the face. Alec didn’t even hesitate to pull out his phone and show them the picture Jasper sent him. “Where did +15 BONUS “Jasper.” Alec said after a few moments. “Kristen and I need to have a word with my father. Keep me updated on their progress.” “Got it.” Jasper said a little too chipper before we started walking back to the pack house. Only when we were out of ear shot of the men, did Alec talk to me. “I’m sorry.” “It’s fine.” I said without looking at him. “It’s not.” Alec grabbed my waist and forced me to turn and look at him. “Kristen, I’m sorry.” “Sorry for what?” I asked, shifting my weight, I crossed my arms and looked at him. “Sorry my dad didn’t avenge you.

###Chapter 222
Chapter 0222 “We found the tunnel.” Jasper mind-linked us all. “What?” Dad asked when everyone stopped talking. “They found a third tunnel.” I filled dad in. “Marc, I think you need to think about stepping down. No, I am going to strongly encourage you to step down before this comes back and takes you down.” Dad looked Alpha Marc in the eyes. “What about you? You stepping down and giving it to your boy?” Alpha Marc spit. “I am. Sooner than you think.” Dad didn’t even hesitate as he answered. Looking at Alec, “What is the next steps?” “We need to extract Judd. All information at this point is considered invalid. We need to regroup and decide on a course. We will be following the tunnels today and closing them off. Hopefully by monday, everyone will be able to come home.” “Good.” Dad nodded in agreement. “Have Penny and Emmy do their thing and see what they find when we come over tomorrow.” I said to noveldrama

dad. “Okay.” Dad came over to me and gave me a hug. “Do you need to come home with me?” “No. I’m okay taking out the trash here.” I gave him one last hug before he turned around. “I will no longer have contact with you, Marc. I will only be dealing with Alec or only Colt will. My agreement is with him now.” Dad didn’t even wait to hear what Alpha Marc had to say. He just walked out of the office and out of the packhouse. “You need to think long and hard on what your next move is. I am going to be sealing off the tunnels and ! expect the correct answer by this evening.” Alec said before he turned. Grabbing my arm, he had me walk in front of him as we left the office. Not even bothering to close the door, we walked back into the

forest. “Alpha!” I heard someone yell for Alec. We hadn’t spoke the whole way. I knew he was working out some personal feelings right now and he would talk when he was ready. “Where is it?” Alec asked not containing his anger. One of the warriors grabbed something and a little door opened up. It was a wooden door that covered a whole in the ground. Just like I was told about the others. It was pitch black, leaving everything to the +15 BONUS “From my own sources. That man beside Judd, we believe might be Penny’s father.” Alec told my dad. “Explain yourself!” Dad’s face was turning shades of red I haven’t seen in a long time. “Yes! I put Judd into an undercover assignment! I knew one day that Rip would be an issue and I wanted to gather all the information on him I could.” “How long has he been in there?” Dad asked. “Nine months!” Alpha Marc ran his hands through his hair. “NINE MONTHS?” Alec roared. “You risked your gam ma’s life for nine f ucking months? What about his family? What about his mate? His own life? What if they figured him out and are forcing him to tell you the wrong stuff? They would have figured him out months ago and he has been living being tortured every day!” “When was the last time you even spoke to him?” Dad had his hands on the desk and looking down at the ground. “We talk over text. He sends me updates and his code word.” Alpha Marc was starting to sound distressed. “They could have broke him and been using that!” Alec punched the wall, creating a fist size whole. “What else are you hiding?” I asked as Alpha Marc opened his mouth to lay into Alec. His eyes went over to me and became slits. “Excuse me? Who are you to question m-”

“Answer the f ucking question dad!” Alec walked back in front of me, blocking me from Alpha Marc. Dad looked over at me and back at them. “I have no idea what your talking about.” Alpha Marc mumbled as he turned and looked out the window. “Yes you do and you need to tell us now! It’s time for your f ucking secrets to come out. Kristen told you about the tunnels. Why has Rip been working on attacking us for years? Why have you had a spy at his territory?” Alec crossed his arms over his chest as he stood firm in front of his dad.







###Chapter 223
Chapter 0223 “Why did he let it get so bad?” He was asking himself more than me. “As f ucked up as this whole situation is, I don’t believe your dad did it with the intention of it going this far.” “What do you mean?” Alec looked down at me. “Alec, you are a solid man. You know right from wrong, you are strong and loyal. You fight for what is right, not what is easy. You are the way you are because of the man that raised you. I don’t believe this all started with the intention of it getting this far. I think your dad got caught up in something and it snowballed. I think he is embarrassed and ashamed of what he has done but doesn’t know how to get out of it. Does he need to step down? Yes. He is wanting so bad for everything to work out that he is blinded to the real threat.” “I hope you are right. I’m telling you now, if we find out what he is hiding is bad….” Alec shook his head like he was struggling to get the words out. “…I’ll challenge him on the spot.” As much as I didn’t want him to do that, I was starting to think that might be the only way to get him to give up control. He was a spiraling man and that is dangerous. “I understand.” We sat there for a little while longer until the sun was high in the sky. “I should check on my men.” Alec noveldrama

sighed. “I am going to go get some lunch around for everyone. I’ll mind-link you when I am done.” Alec stood up and held out his hand for me to take. Accepting it, he pulled me in for a k*ss. “That would be a nice gesture.” “I can’t promise anything fancy as I haven’t been in that kitchen but I’ll do my best.” I promised as we walked out into the sunlight. “It doesn’t have to be anything nice. Just enough to keep us going.” Alec let go of my hand as we had to walk in opposite directions.

“Be safe.” I yelled to him. “You too.” As I walked inside the packhouse, I really hadn’t given it any thought as to the fact that Alpha Marc was still inside. I hadn’t even seen Luna Erin today but that wasn’t completely unusual. Still, not wanting to run into him, I just went straight to the kitchen and closed the door. +15 BONUS Opening the fridge, I started looking at the different options that were available for me to prepare. It must have just got stalked because it was over flowing with ingredients. In the end, I decided to cook some steaks. I’ll be able to slice them and people can decide if you want to put them over a salad, eat a steak plain or put it on a hamburger bun. Pulling out all the steak. My first step was getting the cast iron pan out and season it with oil and salt. Letting that heat up, I pulled the steaks out of the package and patted them dry. After seasoning both sides, I put some butter in the pan and added a steak. Turning on the oven, I set it to keep warm before pulling out the ingredients to make cole slaw. That was pretty basic. Grabbing a large bowl, I emptied the packages and added the sauce before putting it back in the fridge. Moving to the steak, with tongs, I moved the stead so it was searing on all sides before fl*pping it over. I was going for a medium rare. After a steak was done, I wrapped it in foil and put it in the oven. I kept repeating this process and setting the table with different options for them to chose from. I was almost finished when the door opened. “This smells good.” My heart dropped as I turned around. “Alpha Marc…” +15 BONUS







###Chapter 224
Chapter 0224 “Relax. I’m not here to cause trouble.” Alpha Marc waved off my nervous reaction. “Alec… food is ready and your dad just walked into the kitchen.” I said trying to keep my voice steady. “On my way.” Alec responded and I felt his uneasiness. “Food is just about ready. If you want to go sit down, I will bring out the steaks in a minute.” Turning around, I grabbed an oven mitt and pulled them out. However, he didn’t go to the table. Instead, he stood by the door and watched me slice each steak. I left them on the cutting board as I moved them to the table. “Kristen?” I heard Alec yell. “In here!” I answered, completely relieved that he was here. Alec came through the door and did a double take at his dad. “What are you doing in here?” “She didn’t tell you I was here?” Alpha Marc looked at Alec like he didn’t believe him. “Why are you standing in the corner watching her work?” Alec turned and faced his dad. “I’m not causing any trouble. I just was making sure she was safe.”

“After what she has been through, you thought sitting in the corner and watching her work would be comforting to her?” Alec looked at his dad in anger. Jasper and a few other warriors walked through the door. All of them looked between Alec and Alpha Marc before deciding to stand beside Alec. “Let’s all move to the kitchen and eat.” I said trying to break this up. “Great idea. Anything I can help you with?” Jasper asked. Alec and Alpha Marc didn’t break their stare. “No, everything is on the table.” I said as I grabbed Alec’s arm and pulled him away from his dad. Everyone sat down but Alec sat down in the Alpha seat, leaving no room for Alpha Marc. “Okay. I prepared steaks: you can either have it by itself, make a salad or have a steak sandwich. Really whatever you want to do. Please dig in.”

No one spoke as we all grabbed a plate and started making our foods. I had already prepared myself a steak salad so I just picked up my fork and started eating. Alpha Marc grabbed a plate and fix himself a steak sandwich before retiring to his office. I realized it was only then that everyone let out a breath of air in relief. +15 BONUS “This is really good.” Jasper said with a mouth full. “Swallow before you talk to me.” I said giving him a disapproving look. “Luna…” There was a younger warrior looking rather uncomfortable. He kept glancing at me and back at his food. He was probably the same age as I was but he was skinny. “Yes?” “Are you… um…. “Just spit it out, dude.” Another warrior rolled his eyes. “Are you okay?” “Yes. I am feeling much better I got my wolf back. Thank you for asking.” I gave him a small smile as we well into a comfortable silence. Alec was in his own little world, staring off into space. His emotions kept changing form anger to acceptance. There was a hint of sorrow but it was quickly replaced by anger. Seeing that everyone was finished, Alec stood up. “Ready?” “Yes, Alpha!” They weren’t in unison but close to it. “Are you coming out with us?” Alec asked as everyone stood up. “No. I’ll clean the kitchen and then go work in our office until you are done.” Sighing, I stood up and started gathering dishes. “We will help carry things to the kitchen.” A warrior said as he took the plates from my hands. “This is much too heavy for you to carry.” Another one said. Soon, all of them were gathering things and taking them to the kitchen. I felt immense pride fill Alec as he watched his men help me out. “Thank you all!” I said as I followed them in. They even went as far as putting the food away and

loading the dishwasher. Since there was so many of them, it only took a few minutes, where it would have taken me an hour to do. As they left, they all bowed to me. One by one, they walked out the door and went outside to blow some s hit up. “Go to our office and lock the door.” Alec whispered before he k*ssed me on the forehead. +15 BONUSnoveldrama







###Chapter 225
Chapter 0225 “Okay.” I wasn’t about to disagree as I turned and went to our office in a hurry. No reason to linger around. For some reason, this just felt like a daunting task. Working out of an office seemed stuffy. As I locked my door, all I saw was paperwork. There was still all the paper on the floor and we still hadn’t finished going through the phone. Closing my eyes to the paper on the floor, I just went and sat down at Alec’s desk. It was easy enough to back out of the pictures and pull up the next folder. “How is it coming?” I asked, mind-linking Alec. It was about twenty minutes after I felt the third explosion go off. The entire packhouse shook as they blew the explosives. The first time it happened I was actually concerned we were having an earthquake. “Just finishing up. What are you doing?” “Just finished looking through the files. I didn’t find anything that would be considered out of the norm.” As much as I studied it, nothing seemed suspicious that I would think would be a clue to anything. I’m sure it had meaning but I had no idea what it could be. “I didn’t think there would be. Kinda figured they gave it to us to keep us busy. Not even even sure that is all the contents of the phone.” Alec sighed as he seemed to lift something heavy. “I would love to get my hands on his computer.” Sitting back, I just looked at our messy office. “Has he left you alone?” “Yeah, it’s been extremely quiet. Almost too quiet. I don’t like it.” noveldrama

“Hopefully things will go back to normal soon.” Alec said but we both knew that was a lie. “Yeah and Emmy is going to stop crying at everything.” Standing up, I started cleaning up the paper on the floor. Going in a pattern so if we needed to put it bath together we could. “S hit.” Alec snorted. “I’ll see you in a few. Stay in the office. I’ll come get you and we can go up to our room.” “What about supper?” “I ordered pizza for everyone.” Alec said. “You did enough today.”

“Alright.” I wasn’t going to argue. My shoulders were feeling better but it was more difficult to carry those heavier items Alec didn’t respond but he kept the link open. As I finished picking up the pictures, I was able to cl*p them +15 BONUS time I was done, I heard the door unlock. “Hey.” I said as I finished moving the air chair. “What are you doing?” Alec was covered in sweat and dirt. “Putting the office back together.” Shrugging, I turned off the lights and walked out the door that Alec was holding open for me. “F ucking hot down in the tunnels.” Alec sighed. “Smells like it.” I pinched my nose together and made a face. “Funny.” Alec went to put his arm around my but I ducked out of the way. “No, sir! You need a shower!” I laughed as I ran ahead to put some space between us. “You can’t run from me in our room.” Alec called out in a very seductive tone. “I’ll tell you what…” I was leaning against our bedroom door as he closed the gap. “You take a shower first and then I’ll show you what else my tongue can do besides being sarcastic…” I looked up at him and winked. “I’ll hold you to that.” Alec grumbled as he unlocked the door. I had to laugh as he didn’t even hesitate walking straight to the bathroom and got in the shower. “When does the pizza arrive?” I asked, leaning my head into the bathroom. “About fifteen minutes.” He had just stepped into the water. There wasn’t any steam so he must be taking a cold shower. “We are going to meet the pizza guy at the boarder?” I asked. “No, Jasper is, with another warrior. He will bring it back here.”

“What is our next step? I am completely confused on what we should do. I feel like we evacuated everyone for nothing. So I feel like we can’t waste it but I don’t know what to do.”







###Chapter 226
Chapter 0226 “The million dollar question. We are going to shoot around ideas tonight over pizza.” Alec sounded worn out. “I don’t understand why we can’t find anything they own. Even if it is an alias, they will still have to have the money transferred somewhere. There will be a money trail. Same P.O. box or some bank. Has anyone thought about tapping into their phone system?” “What?” Alec looked out of the shower at me. “Well, we do all of our banking over the phone and fax. There is an app so you can scan or take a picture of any check to deposit. I mean, I doubt dad has set a foot in a bank in decades. It wouldn’t be like we could follow him but his phone would have all the numbers to where he is calling. We could find out what bank he is using. What buildings he is calling. Everything.” “We would have to sneak into his territory for that.” Alec said like he was actually thinking about it. “No. You could just hack whatever provider he is using and find out his records that way. Unless you want noveldrama

to listen into his calls, then yes you would have to go into his territory.” “There are only two major phone companies out here.” Alec said quietly. “Yes, sir.” Alec turned off the water and got out. Wrapping a towel around himself, he walked into the livingroom. So, we could find someone to hack into the phone company and get his information. Then we could search for the phone numbers and find out where they go to.” “In theory, yes. If the number is unlisted, then you would run into other issues but yeah. However, if the same company gave survive to the unlisted numbers, you could just look up that number too and figure out who it goes to.”

“How do we find the right numbers for their territory?” “They probably have a dozen or so, just like we do. However, it goes off location. If it goes to a cell, we can find that number and ping it’s location. However, the physical address will be in their system because that is how they know which power lines are used to h ook into.” I shrugged as I watched him get dressed. Apparently, I got his mind working so much he forgot about my mouth. “Interesting” Alec seemed deep in his own mind. “You could take it further and look for internet as well as data. If they are only paying for data and using the internet to make their phones work, you can trace that too. You would be able to know which devices ” 1/2 phones and don’t even realize it.” “That is….” There was a knock on the door. “… crazy to even think about.” Alec walked over and opened the door. “I got the pizza down stairs.” Jasper was standing at the door with his hands in his pockets. He was just wearing gym shorts and that was it. I started walking to the door. “I’m hungry.” My stomach rumbled as on que. “You had a long day?” Jasper looked at me and raised an eyebrow. “Just stared at a computer screen all day.” I shrugged as Alec closed and locked the door behind us. “I guess my mouth will have to wait.” I said in the mind-link. Alec looked at me and narrowed his eyes. All he got in response was a smile. “That sounds terrible.” Jasper said. His voice was laced with sarcasm. “I would have much rather been blowing s hit up all day.” “You could have been blowing me…” Alec grumbled in the mind-link.







###Chapter 227
Chapter 0227 “Better hurry up, Alpha! All the meat lovers will be gone!” I really needed to learn the warrior’s names. How many times now have I talked to them and had no idea what their names were? There was about twenty different men all sitting around. Their ages ranged from what looked like 18 year olds to 50ish year olds. However, everyone was completely ripped and looked dangerous. “I do love my meat.” I said in the mind-link to Alec. He rolled his eyes at me as we went up to the table with all the pizza. Alec handed me a paper plate before he took one. Looking at my options, I chose a meat lovers and a regular beef pizza. Alec took three supreme pizza slices. Following him, we went and sat down on the couch. Most of the guys were gathered around but left the couch open for us three. “What’s the plan, Alpha?” A warrior said. “I’m sorry, I don’t know everyone’s names. Can you please tell me as you talk to I can learn everyone noveldrama

better?” I felt sh itty for even having to ask. “I’m sorry. I guess we really haven’t had a chance to meet. I am Henry.” The warrior answered that just asked Alec the plan. He was one of the younger ones. “Let him eat first, Henry.” He looked disapprovingly at Henry before looking at me. “Name is Remi.” He was mid-range probably. “It’s okay. Actually, Kristen and I were just talking. She had an interesting thought.” Alec looked at me as I took a bite. “I mean, it was more of a sarcastic remark but sure, let’s go with interesting idea.” I couldn’t help myself. I was met with many snorts and smiles for my cheeky response.

“What was it?” A warrior asked. I looked up to see who it was. “Paul, luna.” He answered quickly without me having to ask. “The issue is…” I swallowed what food was in my mouth. “We don’t know what buildings he owns. Apparently, that is a difficult thing to figure out. So, I suggested we bugged his phone.” “Bugged his phone? That would mean we could have to go into his territory. That is a terrible idea!” Henry sounded appalled. “Let her finish.” Alec looked at Henry in annoyance. “However, bugging his phone would allow us to listen to his conversations but not actually find out locations or anything. We need to hack into the telephone company, look up his address and get onto his +15 BONUS plan. You can get onto that and look up all the numbers you called per line. It will be the same for a telephone company.” “Well, s hit.” A warrior to my left sounded shocked. As soon as we met eyes, he quickly said his name. “Peter.” he seemed older as his hair was fully gray. “If he has data, we can possibly find locations of them physically being there. We would need someone to has some serious hacking skills. There most likely will be tons of firewalls and different things.” I took another bite of my pizza. “Beckham.” A few of the younger guys said at once. “Beckham?” Alec asked looking around. “He is a younger kid. Like maybe 13 or 14 years old. He is suppose to be a genius but uses his skills for other aspects in life.” Henry said. “Has he been in trouble for hacking?” Alec asked. “Not enough to gain your attention but he has been suspended from school for it. He got on and found all

the test answers.” Henry shrugged. “If he was a genius, why does he need the test answers?” Another younger warrior asked. “He got paid to do it. He hasn’t taken it yet so he didn’t know what questions they were. Only got caught because a teacher walked into the room and saw him.” “If we find a location, we still have a good amount of explosives left. We can move within hours. I have a few mostly stringed up that we didn’t use for the tunnels.” The oldest looking Warrior answered. He looked right at Alec when he was speaking.







###Chapter 228
Chapter 0228 “Good.” Alec nodded his head. “I will call Penny and Emmy and have them get with Beckham and start the hacking.” “What’s going on in your mind?” Peter was looking at me with a raised eyebrow. “At what point do we just take a step back and see how things unfold?” I said with a little frustration. “I’m not new to this and battle doesn’t bother me but at what point do we…. just stop.” Alec looked at me with confusion. “What do you mean?” “Rushing into something could make us make mistakes. We already blew up the wrong building. Our next move needs to be calculated, impactful and precise. We know Rip is a threat. What if he is waiting for us to make a mistake? All I’m saying is…. we need to be sure of our next move and make it count. Mistakes is what causes people die.” Immediately, I started to feel ashamed. Maybe that was something I should have said to Alec privately. No one said a word but looked at their pizza and ate in/silence. It was just that I had a bad feeling about doing something quickly and didn’t want to make another mistake. That would make us look incompetent. Feeling rather exposed and unsure, I stood up to leave and retreat back to our room. “Where are you going?” Henry asked, quickly.

“Oh, ummm…..” It caught me off guard. “What does it matter? She is the luna and can do whatever she feels, Henry! You need to learn when to keep your mouth shut!” Paul chastised Henry. He put his head down in shame. “Where are you going?” Alec asked, looking at me. “I still have a few questions on what you think is best for a timeline.” Shock filled me as Alec gave me a half smile. It was like he knew exactly why I felt the way I did and called me out on it without giving me away to everyone. “The restroom.” It was the first thing that came to my mind.

“I’ll go give Emmy a call then.” Jasper said as he stood up and followed me out. As soon as we were out of the room, Jasper stopped me. “You didn’t need to use the restroom.” It was a statement, not a question “I do, too!” I said defensively, “Not according to Alec.” Jasper gave me a knowing smile “Fine. No one said a word after I said that last part. Maybe I should have said that privately to Alec.” I was feeling more and more comfortable opening up to Jasper. He was starting to feel like an adopted brother to me. “Kris, you said exactly what needed to be said. Their lives matter as much as the next person. No one wants to f uck up like we just did. Just saying that made each man in there respect you more. They know they aren’t expendable to you.” Jasper gave me a reassuring look. “What, did Alec send you out here so it didn’t look obvious?” “Partly and because I really do need to call Emmy. Just go back in there and be the amazing luna you are.” Jasper pulled out his phone and walked away from me, leaving me in the hallway. After taking a few breaths, I walked back in there. They had resumed talking about what it meant to break into the telephone company and how to go about it. Alec glanced over at me as I walked back in but kept going on his conversation. It made it less focused on me, which I was glad for. “…it can be done remotely. It’s not like we have to go into the wires and create an issue.” Alec said. “Is that true, Luna?” Henry asked. “We don’t have to sneak onto the telephone company’s business and put something onto a wire?” “Have you been watching Oceans 11 or something?” I asked, trying to make a joke of it. “No, we can do everything without leaving here.” “Hopefully, Beckham can.” Alec said. Which reminded me. “Jasper! Have you got ahold of Emmy?” I mind-linked him quickly.noveldrama







###Chapter 229
Chapter 0229 “On the phone, why?” “Beckham needs to be on his own IP address. That way it isn’t linked to that pack.” “Okay, I’ll tell her.” Jasper said and cut the link. “Luna!” Paul said loudly. “What? Sorry, I was making sure Jasper told Emmy, that Beckham needed a different IP address to do this.” I completely spaced off on their conversation. “It’s okay. I asked about the information we got. We should get phone numbers or a list of locations that have service. How do we decide which place to hit?” Paul asked a logical question. One, I didn’t fully have an answer to. “Which ever one make sense. If it was up to me, I would stake it out and see which one would make the most impact.” “We should be acting now! Not waiting!” A warrior in the back stood up and started pacing. I could feel Alec getting mad. “Okay.” I said simply. “Explain yourself?” I kept my face passive as he turned to look at me.

“They didn’t wait to f uck up your shop! They didn’t wait to kidnap you! They took action. We seem like the b itch since we aren’t doing anything about it!” His face was getting red. “Your name?” I asked, calmly. “Cain.” His hands were on his hips as he was taking deep breaths to calm himself. He seemed to be around late twenties or early thirties. His dirty blonde hair kept annoying him as he waved it out of his eyes constantly. “You realize that they had digging those tunnels for probably the good part to a year. Also, my shop is incredibly public. The shooter and everything… they had been planning this for years. YEARS! This wasn’t something they just decided to do over night and had that building been important, we would have made

an impact. Would you like to put your life and your fellow warrior’s lives at risk and go knock on his door?” I kept my voice steady and firm as I spoke. Alec had sat back and draped an arm over the couch, behind me. With his ankle resting on his knee, he just watched the interaction. “I just can’t sit here and do nothing!” Cain sounded defeated. “Making impulsive decisions based on your emotions will not get you the response or result you are response is the best response. What do you think they are thinking over there? If it was me, I would be by me walking in his front door. Sometimes, no active wondering why they haven’t attacked yet.” “We moved our pack to another pack expecting them to attack.” Another warrior helped me out. “Exactly. They are probably ready for a fight and we will give them one. Just not today. We will strike when they least expect it and in the most painful way possible.” I was incredibly sincere about what I was saying. Everyone was quiet for awhile before Cain finally sat down. He still seemed upset or maybe just emotional in general but either way, we didn’t hear from him again. “What’s the plan for tomorrow?” Henry asked. “We will see what Beckham is able to find tonight. Kristen and I have to go to Alpha Brian’s pack tomorrow anyway and we will see what they have uncovered. Depending on that, we will address it accordingly.” Alec said leaning forward. “So… we have a day off?” A younger kid beside Henry asked. “You need to be ready in case something happens but yes, you can relax.” Alec put his hand on my knee as if to say it was time to go to bed. “Get some sleep everyone.” I said as I stood up. Alec followed me out as everyone said goodnight. “Why hasn’t Jasper come back yet?” I asked. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!! noveldrama







###Chapter 230
Chapter 0230 “No idea.” Al ec put his hand on my lower back as we walked up the stairs. “I’ll mind-link him.” “Okay.” Thankfully, it only took him a few minutes to respond back to me. “Still on the phone with Emmy. She does have Beckham working on it but it will be awhile I guess.” “That’s fine.” I yawned as we got to our room. “Tired?” “Yes…no.” I shrugged. Alec opened the door for us and locked it behind him. “Worried about tomorrow?” Alec walked over and poured us a glass of whiskey as I sat down on the

couch. “My dad possibly dying and my brother getting the role he was born for.” What’s to worry about? “I would think death would be welcoming to someone in your dad’s position.” Alec sighed as he sat down beside me. Handing me my drink, I took a sip and leaned against his arm that he draped over. “I’ll miss him.” “I know but isn’t his happiness worth what he has prepared your entire life for?” I looked over at Alec. He shot down the rest of his whiskey and looked at me. “It is but the only family I will have left is Colt. As difficult as your parents are… they are still alive. There is something different about when you lose both of them.” “You still have Emmy and Jacob. They are like your siblings and as much as you bicker with Jasper, he seems to be like your brother.” “He can be annoying as such.” I snorted. Alec leaned forward and set his glass down. “Come on. Let’s go to bed.” Alec stood up and held out his hand for me. Accepting it, I downed my drive as we walked over to the bed. Taking my shorts, s hit and bra off. I took his shirt he took off and put itnoveldrama

on to wear to bed. Sl*pping under the covers, Alec pulled me against him. “Sleep. You are safe and loved here.” Darkness took over before he was even finished talking. “Are you about ready?” Alec popped his head into the closet. I had showered, curled my hair, put makeup on and was standing in front of all my clothes in a pair of matching bra and underwear set. Alec had put on a nice pair of jeans that hugged his as s nicely with a tighter athletic t-shirt. It was a set up from a basic “I can’t decide what to wear.” My anxiety was a mile high. My hands shook, my legs refused to stand still and I had to fight off the sweats that kept threatening to mess up my makeup. “Put on a sundress or one of those shirt things that have shorts attached to them.” Alec walked in and looked at my closet too. “Here. I like this one on you.” “You mean a romper?” Alec pulled down a deep purple flowy romper. The shoulders were capped and the waist was cinched so the bottoms stopped mid-thigh. It had a short V in the front but it honestly made my legs look amazing. After putting it on, I realized I had lost come muscle mass. “I really got to start working out again.” “How is your shoulder feeling?” Alec asked as I took the romper off the hanger and started putting it on. The bruises were almost faded but hints of yellow and green were visible. “Feeling pretty normal.” Looking at myself in the mirror, I felt like I was looking at a stranger. Six months ago, if you would have told me I was getting ready to go have dinner with my dad for possibly the last time as he chose to die, I would have told you, you were lying. My hair is longer, my toned muscles were gone and my skin was ghostly white. “You look beautiful.” Alec wrapped his hands around me. “I look like I need to work out in the sun for six months to look normal.” Rolling my eyes, I grabbed my purse and walked out of the closet. I knew I walked away from him showing me some affection but he wasn’t mad. He has been worried about me all morning, even though he has been trying to hide it.







###Chapter 231
Chapter 0231 “I’d still f uck you.” Alec gave me a look before opening the door. “You didn’t even try last night.” I reminded him as I walked out. Alec shut the door behind me and locked it. “You didn’t seem like you wanted to.” Alec put his hand on my lower back as we walked down to the garage. “I could have been persuaded.” “I’ll remember that.” Alec rolled his eyes at me. “Are your parents coming along?” I asked as Alec opened the door to an Audi for me. “No. After everything that has been going on, I didn’t want them to come.” Alec shut the door and walked around to his side. Getting in, he started it and backed out before driving off.

“Where was everyone this morning?” “Probably sleeping in since they had a free morning for a change.” My legs were bouncing as I kept shifting in my seat. To say that I was uncomfortable was an understatement. Alec had reached over and firmly placed his hands on my thigh to keep me still. As if reacting on instinct, both my hands wrapped around his forearm and held on tightly. Alec took all my squeezing and then some. “I was hoping to never see these gates again.” I whispered as we pulled us. The guards saw me and nodded before opening them and letting us pass. “Kristen, I know this will be hard but remember, this is his choice. He wants this. As much as you and Colt are going to hurt, remember that his soul is being set free.” Alec’s words were like ice water being splashed in my face. It was a dose so of reality that helped me calm down. Just a little. I was able to take a deep breath. Colt and Penny were standing on the porch. steps. Colt had his hand around her as Penny waved big at us. I took one last deep breath before Alec

opened my door for me. When he got out, I wasn’t even sure. “Kris! It’s so good to see you!” Penny ran down the steps and hugged me. It felt good to see her again. “How are you?” She looked good, no sunken eyes or bruises. “I’ve had a really good time actually this last week. She didn’t have to tell me what she meant, I knew it, “Hey, sis.” Colt walked up and I threw myself in his arms. It felt good to be back in my twin brother’s embrace. As much as I loved Alec, Colt will always have a comfort to him that I can’t find anywhere else. “Hey.” It was all I could get out. “How are the shoulders?” Colt let me go and looked at them. “Feel perfectly fine, just a little bruising.” I lifted them to show them I had full range. “Good.” Colt stepped back and shook Alec’s hand before giving him a half hug. “Thanks for coming, man.” “Kris!” I heard my dad’s voice from the porch. Looking over, dad and An n walked out to greet us. Dad was a few steps ahead of An n. Thankfully, she stopped at the steps as dad came down and gave me a hug. “Dad!” Not quite as aggressive but I wrapped my arms around him. Knowing this might be my last day with him had me feeling things I wish I never had to. “You look good, kiddo. How are you feeling?” Dad let me go and like Colt, looked at my shoulders. “I’m good. Feeling great.” Even if I didn’t feel good, I wasn’t going to tell him that. “Good!” Dad nodded before shaking Alec’s hand firmly. “Thank you for bring her.” Alec wasn’t sure how to respond to that as his mouth opened and closed a few times. “It was my pleasure, sir.” He finally settled on. “Penny has a beautiful picnic set up for us in the garden.” Colt said, interrupting the awkwardness. I half expected An n to make a remark but instead, she just turned and walked ahead of us. Her nose was kept in the air as she aggressively walked on. Colt and Penny were ahead of us. I saw Penny put her hand on Colt’s back as if to calm him down.noveldrama








###Chapter 232
Chapter 0232 My hand sl*pped around Alec’s arm, holding onto him. Not his hand but his forearm. Why I felt the need to hold onto him and not just hold his hand was something I didn’t want to think about. Thankfully, Alec didn’t try to move me or even question it. He allowed me to do what I needed to do. The walk to the garden was the longest walk of my life. Everyday, if not more, I would walk to this garden to escape my life. It never seemed this far away. Alec was feeling protective, and on edge but he kept trying to push calmness to me. Maybe those were my emotions he was trying to take from me but I couldn’t tell right this second. “This looks amazing.” I tried to keep my voice steady as we walked up to the picnic. Penny had put a large around table with an umbrella in the garden. A tablecloth gripped the edges and different fruit, salads, sliders and breads covered the table. “Thank you. I have started cooking and wanted to try a few new recipes. I hope you like them. You will have to tell me what you think.” Penny smiled warmly at me. I watched as Alec and Colt moved Penny and I between them as Dad and An n sat on the other side of them. Colt sat directly beside An n but there was still enough space for a whole person. Dad didn’t sit very close to her either. “Where did you find the recipes?” An n asked as she scrunched up her nose. She had bent over to smell the sliders. noveldrama

Penny looked a little uncomfortable. “It was a new cookbook I got.” My back straightened as I look at the sliders. She found the cookbook at mom’s house? These were my mom’s sliders? “Ice?” Colt got my attention and gave me a look. My mouth was dry as I tried to unscramble my thoughts. “I think it smells amazing!” Alec put his arm on my lower back, saving me from answering. “Let’s eat!” Dad said quickly and started putting sliders on his plate. An n took one but pushed it to the side.

I put some bread, salad and pasta on my plate until the sliders came around. Not sure how hungry ! actually was, I put one on my plate and kept passing it. Colt put three like he knew he loved them. “So, Alec. Where you able to eliminate the tunnels?” Dad asked. I was thankful for the change of subject. Deciding to be brave, I grabbed the slider and took a bite. “We did. It went much smoother than I expected. Obviously, we lost a few trees but no damage to the wall. There is a new ravine. I’ll probably get some dirt brought in and fill in the holes.” +15 BONUS The sliders were like a meatball with swish cheese. It had this BBQ sauce that had a different taste to it. Either way, it was amazing. The bun was soft and had a peppery flavor to it. I absolutely loved it. As much as it made my heart ache from the loss of not knowing what else my mom could have made us, I kept my face straight. A time or two, I saw Alec glance over at me. “I have some dirt we can give. Penny had started on a new pool and we needed to lengthen the old one.” Dad said. “Emmy wants to build a new pool too.” I said, smiling at Penny. “I know! She told me about it last night. She is glowing!” Penny smiled back. “She looked sickly, not glowing.” An n snorted. Dad gave her a look that caused her to roll her eyes and look away. Not sure what he said to her but it seemed to be working. Mrs. Smith Author ” Thank you all for reading!!!








###Chapter 233
Chapter 0233 What are the next steps? Dad asked as if to ignore A nn Kristen had a brilliant idea” Alec said taking another bite of pasta and looking at me I had a bite of salad half way up to my mouth when I paused. Looking around, everyone was looking at me, waiting for an answer. Setting my fork down, I had a sudden discomfort for being put on display. “Oh, um… did Penny not tell “She did but I would like to hear it from you” Dad gave me a look that I hated. It was like I was being tested and I got it my whole life. “If we hack into the telephone company, we got find his file based off his location of service and d******d his call history. Then we can match locations with assigned numbers and find out what locations he calls. From there, we can deep dive. The rest is self explanatory.” “How did you come up with that idea?” Penny asked. “It was really just a snide remark that Alec tuned into. From there, it snowballed.” noveldrama

“That is actually really good.” Colt said with a mouthful of slider. “Thanks. I hope it works. Has Beckham found anything?” I asked. “He’s still working on it but he is making progress. He is moving slower due to the firewalls and not wanting to leave a footprint so it’s taking a little bit.” Penny nodded. “Where is he doing it from?” Alec asked. “Remember that old abandoned coffee shop a few miles from the city?” Colt asked. “Oh.” Nodding, the image of the shop flashed in my head. The windows were broken, paint was peeling and small rodents called it home. looked over and An n barely touched anything. Instead, she was just pushing it around her plate. I was finished eating and so was everyone else. “It is such a lovely morning.” Dad looked up at the sun

that was creeping up in the sky. “It really is,” Penny agreed. We all knew what was coming next. Our heads were slightly bowed as wo didn’t want it to happen but still did at the same time. “I thought you wee going to give me a present.” An n glared at dad. “You are right. I did tell you that.” Dad nodded. “Well, the kids are here. Not they are grateful for anything I did for them but you wanted them here. So, where is it?” An n crossed her arms over her chest. Dad smiled at A nn. “We have to go to it. Let’s all go for a walk.” Dad announced and stood up. Colt acted as if he knew this was happening and so did Penny. I wasn’t sure I wanted to have known or not but regardless, I wasn’t ready. We walked behind dad and A nn. Colt and Penny were beside us, quietly walking. Dad had a bounce to his step that I hadn’t seen in years. An n was practically sk ip ping. I wondered what she thought she was going to get. As we came up to a hill, there was a small arch. It was covered in white flowers that hung down. Pots of more white flowers were lined up, making an aisle. “You did this? For me? Are we renewing our vows?” An n looked at dad and grabbed his arm. Jacob and Clint were standing on either side of the arch, waiting. Did they know? “Something like that.” Dad smiled brightly as we walked up. Colt nodded for us to sit on the left and they sat on the right. Dad pulled An n up to the front. Standing in front of each other, he held her hands. A nn had this s tupidly large smile with a tear in her eye. “This is lovely.” An n started. “Let me talk, please.” Dad announced. She appeared to be taken aback but gathered herself. “I have something prepared.” “Okay.” Straightening her back, she looked him in the eye. “An n, you were an old fling that came into my life when I needed someone the most. I had lost my true

mate and my one true love.” My hand reached out and grabbed Alec. I knew my nails were digging into him but he didn’t move. “I had my kids and this pack that needed me. I needed to live and you gave me that option.” An n blinked a few times as if trying to wrap her head around what he was saying. “I believed you would be a great step-mother to my kids. I thought you would taken them in as your own. Love them, teach them things and make memories.”








###Chapter 234
Chapter 0234 Dad paused as if trying to let his words sink in. An n tried to pull her hands out of his but he tightened his grip. “Brian.. I don’t…” “I was wrong on all accounts. You did not love them. The only thing you taught them is fear and anger. Every chance you got, you wold abuse my daughter, simply because she looks like her mother. Fortunately for you, I needed to stay alive to make sure they lived to adulthood and find their mates. I am a smart man and I had set up their future so when the time came that I passed away, they would be taken. care of. I knew you wouldn’t do it. Now they are both grown and have their mates, I have full confidence in doing what I should have done 18 years ago.” “No!” An n tried to take her hands out of dad’s but she failed. He held onto them. It took very little effort as he didn’t even move his feet. An n was crying, “Please don’t! I love you! I have always loved you! I rejected my mate for you!” “You want?” Dad seemed confused. “That’s right! I rejected my mate right before I came to you and proposed us mating!” An stopped fighting like she accepted this. “Who?” “I’ll never tell!” An n spit. noveldrama

“I, Brian Jeffrey, Alpha of the Blue Fang Pack, reject you, An n Jeffrey, Luna of the Blue Fang Pack.” Dad’s voice was strong as he said those words. An n shrieked in pain. Grabbing her heart, she fell to the ground sobbing. Dad closed his eyes and clenched his jaw as he accepted the pain. Slowly, he opened his eyes and smiled at An n. “I’ll get everything.” An n said through gritted teeth. “You won’t. I have been planning this. Everything get’s passed down to my kids.” “I accept your rejections you spineless as shole!” An n shrieked. Colt got up and went over to dad, helping him stand, dad looked him in the eye. “I, Brian Jeffrey, Alpha

of the Blue Fang Pack, pass on the title of Alpha to my son, Colt Jeffrey.” “I, Colt Jeffrey, accept the role of Alpha of the Blue Fang Pack!” “NO!” An n cried as she watched the exchange. Dad doubled over as I watched the power shift to Colt. “Take her to the cells.” He demanded, looking at +15 BONUS grabbed an arm. They had to drag a kicking and crying An n away from us and to the cells. “Kristen.” Dad called out with a weak voice. It was like my feet moved on their own as they crawled over to my dying dad. “What?” I hadn’t realized there was tears in my eyes until I couldn’t see my dad anymore. Squeezing them shut, I felt that water spill over before I could partly see him again. “Here. These are for you.” Dad’s shaky hand reached in his pocket and pulled out a string of pears. “They were your mothers. I hoped to..” Dad coughed a few times. “…give these to you at your luna ceremony but I won’t make it.” He gave me a wake smile as his shaking hands failed to reach out to me. Grabbing his hand, I pulled it towards me as I took the pearls. “Oh, dad…” I couldn’t stop the tears that refused to slow. Colt kneeled down on the other side. “I love you, old man.” Colt’s eyes were filled with tears too. “I’m so proud of you both.” Dad looked between us, before looking up at Alec. “Take care of my daughter. I would trust no one else.” His speech was starting to slow as his breathing grew light. We watched as his eyes flashed black before we watched his wolf die behind his eyes. “It will be my honor.” Alec said firmly. I couldn’t look up at him. “Kristen… I’m happy.” Dad made a few choking noises. “Dad!” I screamed as his eyes rolled in the back of his head. “I love you.” For the first time, in I’m not sure how long, I full on cried. I didn’t even try to stop it as I cried for my dad. He might have wanted this. Wanted to be free but that didn’t make it less painful. He didn’t even make it five minutes after rejecting An n.







###Chapter 235
Colt reached his arm out and griped my shoulder. I wasn’t sure how long we sat there and cried together but Alec eventually grabbed me and pulled me back. I watched as a couple warriors came over with a wooden stretcher. Carefully, they put dad on it and started carrying him. I guess I was too distracted by the flower to miss the pile of wood that was gathered about a hundred yards away.

When the warriors headed in that direction, I saw my old and current pack walking up the hill. “Dad didn’t think he would make it long so he arranged his own funeral.” Colt said, his voice was thick with emotion.

Alec kept his arm firmly around me as we walked over and sat down in the front row. I didn’t have it in me to look at everyone. Everyone from my past and my present. Penny handed me a tissue before she took her seat on the other side. There wasn’t any murmurs or whispers. Everyone was quiet and respectful.

Only when everyone was seated, did Colt start to speak. He was standing directly in front of our dad. Jacob was standing off to the side. When we made eye contact, I realized he was crying too.

“We are brought here together to honor my father, Alpha Brian.” There was a few cries in the back but mainly people blowing their nose. “I would like to start with a story. When we were little, our mother passed away. Needing to stay alive for us, dad mated with An n. He had hoped An n would come to care for us as her own. Obviously, we all know that was not the case. However, he needed to make sure our future was secured as well as the pack was not left in her hands.” Colt paused as he gathered himself. How he managed to make it through this, I’ll never know. “After we turned 18 and found our mates, dad started to planning his exit strategy. He organized this himself and left us with a smile on his face. Alpha Brian to you, dad to us and friend to others, left on his own terms. I always assumed he would die in battle but he was stubborn and liked to do things his way.”

That earned a few laughs from people around. Resting my head on Alec’s shoulder, he kept rubbing his thumb on my arm. Colt was right, if he was going to die, it was going to be on his term. Dad made sure of

it.

“After a few things fell into place, now was the correct time to move forward with his plan and reject An n, thus killing him. We were able to shift the title of Alpha over to me, making Penny your new luna.” Colt gave Penny a small smile. The love in his eyes was clear. “With Jacob as my beta, I vow to be as great as an Alpha as my dad.” noveldrama

There was cheers around the crowd, louder than I anticipated but Colt had been doing Alpha duties for awhile now, it wasn’t that big of a change. I watched as Jacob lit the torch on fire and handed it over to

Colt







###Chapter 236
“I will love you, old man. I hope to make you proud and accomplish all you hoped for me… for us.” Colt looked at me to see if I wanted to say anything. Slightly shaking my head no, he nodded and rested the torch on dad’s chest. His b*dy instantly erupted in flames.

Jacob brought over a larger Elm tree. After placing it in a hole, he used a shovel and finished planting it.” We will not be moving his ashes but allowing them to become one with the ground from which he died. This was dad’s wish.” Colt walked over and sat down beside Penny. Jacob sat in the second row, next to Sherry and his parents.

Everyone was quiet as we watched the ashes fly in the wind before sinking into the earth. A low rumble was heard in the distance, telling us a storm was coming. How perfect it would be to allow his b*dy to seep into the ground, really making him one with the earth as which we came from.

One by one, people got up and went back to their houses or safe location. Colt and I just sat there. Watching what little bit was left of our dad before the flames went out. Jacob got up and started digging a whole to put the rest of the bones that didn’t burn in the fire. After he was completely buried, did Colt stand up. noveldrama

“Come on, sis.” Finally tearing my eyes away from the freshly dug grave, did I look at Colt. “I have a few things for you in

in my

office.” I just felt numb. It helped my dad wanted this but it still hurt.

Part of me wanted Alec to just carry me but my pride got in the way. Instead, I took his hand and stood up to follow Colt. My steps were much slower than Colt’s so I fell behind as we walked silently down the

hill

and to the packhouse. Alec never once tried to get me to walk quicker or even take control. He just stood

beside me and was my rock.

I wasn’t sure if it was out of habit or what but as we walked up the steps, my heart started pounding. More than once I had to remind myself that A nn wasn’t in here and I was finally safe here. I was safe to come

back and visit my brother. Visit my old pack, friends and any future kids they might have.

Colt left the office door open as him and Penny had arrived there minutes before we did. He was doing

something on the computer when we walked in. Penny was in one arm chair so I took the other. Alec

stood behind me as we waited to hear what my brother had to say.

Colt sighed and ran his fingers through his hair and down his face before looking at me. “Dad left you this

letter. He wrote it this morning.” Colt slid over a vanilla envelope that contained more than just paper.

“What else is in here?” I asked taking it.

“The key and a few other random things.” The string of pearls were still wrapped around my fingers.

Colt’s eyes landed on them. “Mom wore those on her luna ceremony. It took months for him to find those. He refused to put them in the envelope. Wanted to give them to you himself.”

“Can I see her house?” I asked, my voice was quiet but controlled.

“Of course you can.” Penny said. “I actually have some stuff I wanted to offer you. Since I have been there, keeping away from An n. I had went through the house and cleaned it. I’m guessing you already made the connection from the food that the cookbook was at your mother’s house. I made copies for you

but if you want the original… I would understand.”

It took me a minute to wrap my head around what she was saying. Part of me was annoyed she was offering me anything. It was all rightfully mine but dad did leave it to Colt in the will, including all the contents of it. She was probably thinking she was being nice and doing the right thing by offering stuff to

me. It was also that she picked out what she wanted before I even saw it.







###Chapter 237
“Ice, we can go through the house and decide together what you want to keep and what we will keep.

Penny just pulled out things like your baby blanket and stuff like that. Stuff you might want to use for your

own kid that mom picked out for you.” Colt must have read my face.

Taking a deep breath, I forced my emotions down so I could keep a straight face. “Okay.”

“Like my dad, I will be working directly with you.” Colt said, looking at Alec.

“Understood. I am handling things on my end. I’m prepared to do what I need to do to see that my pack is

protected.” I could see that Colt read between the lines as he glanced at me.

“Let me know if you need anything.” Colt said as he stood up.

Following his lead, I looked around one last time at dad’s office. Colt would probably change a few things

but this would be the last time I saw it like this. Alec placed his hand on my lower back, as if wanting to

give me comfort but he was unsure how. Taking the vanilla envelope from me, Alec stood beside me.

“Do you need anything before we head over to the house?” Penny asked, somewhat timidly.

“No….thank you.” I said as I grabbed the door handle and shut it quietly. Alec didn’t put his hand around

me back as we walked so I reached out and held onto his arm as we walked down the stairs. People were noveldrama

moving around, doing their tasks like this was a normal day. I knew me ntally that this was normal but I

still felt a way about it.

“We need to drive there. If you want to follow us, that would be good.” Colt said to Alec. He glanced down

and saw me holding onto Alec’s arm like it was my lifeline. Colt frowned but didn’t say anything.

“Sure.” Alec nodded. He steered me to our car and opened the door for me.

Sliding in the driver’s seat, he put the envelope on the dash before starting the car. He didn’t ask me

anything or even try to get me to talk. Instead, he started the car and followed Colt. Instead, he put his

hand on my thigh as I watched the packhouse fade away.

Was made our way through the little town that has been growing until we got to the outskirts. I remember

very clearly as a child how overgrown the brush was in this area but now it was cleared out. A small

driveway was partially hidden when Colt turned down it. Alec creeped along as we looked at the amazing

scenery around us. Thick, lush trees that hadn’t been touched by man filled the hole around until it

opened up and a beautiful two-story house sat in front of us.

The paint was chipping but the structure looked good.

Alec stopped the car as short distance away so I could see the whole thing and take it in. It looked like it

weather had got to it.

A white screen sat in front of a wooden door. I noticed the brushes and different tools off to the side as I

got out of the vehicle and started walking towards it.

The bushes had been trimmed and new flowers were planted in the flower beds. No doubt Penny wanted

to get out of the house for a little in the middle of the day. There was even a decent size tree with a little

baby swing hanging from a branch. The swing was stained from sitting rain water and years worth of

neglect but knowing my mother put it up there for Colt and I to use one day was warming.

Colt and Penny didn’t talk but just watched me walk around as if I was taking it all in. The trash bags were

filled with scrapped off paint, rags with spider webs on them and a very distinct smell of bleach around

them. There was cu shions with mold growing on them next to the trash bags. Looking on the porch, they

must have replaced the moldy ones with new ones. What caught my eye, Penny chose a fabric that was

almost identical to the one that mom had chosen.







###Chapter 238
If I had any tears left to give, I probably would have. However, I was just going through the emotions at

this point. Walking up the steps, Colt opened the front door for me. Penny had already walked in and was

standing in the living room. There was a closet to my left. The wall extended and the T.V was mounted to

the wall. The livingroom opened up to my right. It was a good sized livingroom with two dark grey

couches facing eachother and two matching black recliners directly in front of the T.V. A glass coffee

table sat between the couches. An off grey rug extended between the two couches but came up short for

the recliners. The wood floor appeared to be original with the tiny slats.

Everything had wear spots like it was used but still in good shape. My first impression was homy. It was

the type of house you could walk into and put your feet up on the couch without worrying anyone would

be upset. Pictures were on the wall. I recognized our mother’s parents from other pictures dad showed

us. Since mom was the only child, I assumed the dated baby pictures were of her. The mantel had

pictures in a gold frame of who I assumed was mom growing up. One from when she was around nine

months and then when she was many five or six. The next was her high school prom and finally a picture

of her and dad with a swollen belly. They looked so in love.

“I kept everything as I found it. I wanted you to see it before we made any changes to it.” Penny said,

pulling my attention away from the pictures.

“If there is anything you want to take with you, just let me know.” Colt said as he came up beside me. He

took the picture I was just looking at and held it in his hands. “I’m not getting rid of anything but I’ll put

them in a safe place.”

“You’re right. This is just how I would have pictured it.” I whispered as I looked around. I kept noticing more things the longer I looked. The white ceiling fan that had a gold pinstripe design to it. The curtains

were a solid sheer white that covered the wooden blinds. Even the faded white paint on the walls that desperately needed touched up.

“Over here is the kitchen with a small bathroom in the hallway.” Penny said as she left the kitchen. The doorway was larger than a traditional/doorway but still just a doorway. The kitchen was an L-shaped layout with cabinets lining the left wall, just after another doorway that lead into the hall. A large island sat in the middle with three stools and a small table pushed against the right wall.

I could see and smell the wood refinisher that Penny used to clean the light stained oak cabinets. The golden handles were shiny. Even the floral wallpaper that covered the kitchen was faded but cleaned. The wooden floors extended into the kitchen and from what I could see, down the hall. More pictures of mom and dad or our grandparents hung on the wall. There was one with a large number of people in it that I

wasn’t sure who they all were.

“That is mom’s family.” Colt said coming up to me. “Dad told me who everyone was: Not sure I’ll noveldrama

4

her parents and siblings.”






###Chapter 239
“There are like twelve…”

“Yeah, grandma had eleven siblings. The women moved on with their mates. Penny has been trying to

track them down to see if we have any other family out there.”

“Did dad not know?” I looked at Colt.

“He wasn’t sure. It wasn’t a priority for him at the time and when things started falling into place, he had

to seal this place up so it would be safe.”

It was all I could do to nod. Things must have been really bad for him to felt the need to preserve this

place. The front door opened and Jacob walked in. As soon as his eyes locked on mine, I ran up to him

and hugged him tightly. He returned my hug, wrapping his arms tightly around me. It had been so long

since I seen him and it just dawned on me how much I missed him. I missed our friend group. I missed

getting pizza at the parlor, or going to the club.

“Hey, Ice.” Jacob laughed as he let me go.

“It’s been a long time since I seen you. I tried to give him a smile.

“I know. You have been… busy.” Jacob reached around him and pulled Sherry against him.

“Sherry. It’s good to see you.” I immediately felt bad for hugging Jacob. I knew she had a rough time

accepting him and I’m sure seeing him hug another girl wasn’t easy. Especially one that she only had met

like twice.

“I’m good. I really like being here and Jacob and I have really come a long way in this short time.” Sherry

looked up at Jacob. “I’m sorry for your loss.” She said after a moment and looked back at me.

After a moment of silence, Penny spoke up. “Would you like to continue to tour?”

Alec was just standing in the corner with his hands in his pockets, just letting me take it all in. Jacob

walked up to Alec and shook his hand as I followed Penny down the hall.

“That is a bathroom.” Penny turned the light on. It was directly behind the kitchen wall. It was a basic noveldrama

bathroom with the same wooden floor. The vanity was light blue with a white counter top and a blue sink.

The toilet was light blue and so was the tub. She had it decorated in a water theme with she-shells and

sea-horses on the shower curtain.

“Here is the master bedroom with on-suit and this is the stairs.” There was a door next to the bathroom

When penny opened it, it revealed a massive bedroom. There was a four-poster bed with white lace hanging down. The bed was made with a white down comforter. There was probably a dozen pillows of

front and center and was all hand stitched.

Picking it up, I smelled it. It didn’t have a smell to it. “Do you want to keep that?” Colt asked.

Looking at it, I traced the letters. “No, it should stay here. I’m not a Jeffrey anymore.” Setting it back down, I saw double doors. It was open enough that it was a closet and I’m sure the bathroom went under

the stairs.

Colt opened the door to the stairs. Only Penny and Alec followed me. I noticed Jacob and Sherry sat

down on the couch, as if to give us space. The L-shaped stairs opened up into a living area. There was a couch and few rocking chairs with pink and blue baby toys. Matching playmates sat along the wall with matching teething toys or rattlers. The only difference, one was blue and one was pink. There was huge

windows that over looked a backyard and into the forest.

The wooden floors kept going but was covered by a large colorful rug. It had the rainbow on it, the numbers and different toddler stuff on it. It seems our mother was making this our play room. Her excitement caused her to get things that we didn’t need yet. It was like looking at a could-have-been life.

“There are bedrooms down here.” Colt said as he walked out of this room and into a hallway. We

followed him to the first bedroom. It was covered in a light pink with a dark stained wooden crib against the far wall. A changing table and dresser each claimed a fall with decals of different flowers on the

walls. The crib set was pink and purple flowers with a matching blanket hanging off it. Like the rest of the house, a large rug at in the middle but continued the floral theme mom apparently picked out for me.






###Chapter 240
“Those boxes are clothes and blankets that she had picked out. I boxed them up for you to take if you want. You don’t have to but if you wanted to use them on your own child, you could. I left this blanket here just because that is how she had it but obviously, all the bedding and crib is yours. Everything in this

room is yours.” Penny said, quietly. noveldrama

I was so numb I wasn’t sure what to say. Kids was the furthest thing from my mind that I didn’t even think

what I might want. However, I knew I didn’t not want the option.

“How about we take everything and we can put it in our storage and when we have kids, you can decide what you want?” Alec came up beside me and put his hand on my lower back.

“Okay.” I was thankful he stepped up and answered for me. I wasn’t sure what to think, say or even feel.

“My room was pretty much the same just blue.” Colt said as he walked to another room. I followed him

but instead of flowers, he had a wolf or animal theme. Decals of a large wolf sat behind a wooden toy

chest. His room was mainly blues, grays and blacks but the furniture was the same.

“There is a bathroom across the hall and a guest room at the end. That is the room I have been staying

in.” Penny said.

I didn’t realize how late it had gotten when I heard Colt’s stomach growl. Penny looked at him and

smirked as he put his arm around her. “Are you going to Florida to see what the key reveals?” Colt asked.

“Yeah, when things get figured out here we will.”

“Hopefully sooner than later.” Colt walked out of his old bedroom and down the hall. I followed him but

stopped one last time in my room.

“Do you want me to carry theses down?” Alec asked.

“Yes, please.” Alec and Colt both grabbed a box and headed down stairs. There wasn’t anything on the

dresser so I assumed Penny put all that in the boxes. Grabbing the blanket, I followed them down.

“Jacob, go get the other box.” Colt ordered as he walked out the front door.

“Do you want to stay for supper?” Penny asked as Jacob got off the couch and headed up stairs.

“Oh… ummm…” I wasn’t sure if I wanted to leave or not. Part of me was ready to run away. The other part

wanted to never leave this place. However, I didn’t want to face everyone yet.

“Thank you but I think I just want to go home and watch a movie.”

Penny gave me a knowing look. “I understand. The door is always open to you. You don’t need an invite to

come over. I am going to live here permanently and not in the packhouse. Your mother wanted to raise

you both here so I decided to do the same our kids. I want any kids Colt and I have to have the childhood

that your mother wanted for you.”

“Thank you.” Was all I could get out. I wish I could raise my kids here but maybe I could get Alec to build

me a house for us to raise our kids and isn’t in the packhouse. I wasn’t a fan of the layout but I loved how

it made me feel welcomed.

The guys walked back in. Alec looked at me, trying to read me. “Beckham is still trying to figure it out. You

are welcome to stay for supper or however long you want to or I can call when he figured it out.” Colt

stood right inside the doorway.

“Just call me when you hear something.” I said as I looked around one last time.

“Sure you don’t want to stay for supper?” Colt asked as he walked up to me.

“I’m sure. I want to get something ordered in and just lay on the couch watching a movie.” Colt nodded

and gave me a hug.

“I love you, sis.” He whispered.

“Love you, too.” I whispered back. I felt his smile but he hid it when he let me go.

Walking out, Alec followed me to our car. Opening the door for me, I stopped and gave the house one last

look. I knew I would be back but it will probably look different when I would. Finally, I got in the front seat

and Alec shut the door. After he sl*pped in to his seat, he started the engine.







###Chapter 241
“Ready?” He asked, giving me one last chance to stay.

“I am.” Reaching over, I took his arm and brought my legs up to my chest. His hand grabbed my right thigh as I laid my head down on his shoulder. Holding onto his arm, Alec started driving us home.

“What do you want to order for supper?”

“Something sp icy.”

“Chinese?” Alec asked after a second.

“That sounds good.” The trees flew by as we drove back to our pack. The radio was off and it just seemed

peaceful.

Alec slowed the car down as we made our way to the boarder. There wasn’t a guard in sight. The gate

was laying on the ground, smashed. Everything in me was screaming.

Something bad had happened. Alec’s whole demeanor changed as he floored it. I could feel sierra pacing

behind my eyes as we drove up to the heinous scene in front of us. Three men with guns guided us to

park and get out.

All the warriors were on the knees with their hands behind their heads. Rope kept them tied together.

Luna Erin was positioned the same but Alpha Marc’s face was bl oody. He was kneeling before Alpha Rip.

Darin was smiling at me as I stepped out.

“Where have you been? You been missing all the fun!” Darin walked over and grabbed my arm. Yanking

me forward, I heard a gun co ck. I was able to see just enough as someone put a glock against Alec’s noveldrama

temple.

“Try anything and she dies.” A warrior from Alpha Rip’s pack said in a very co cky tone.

“What are you doing here?” I asked, firmly.

“We can to invade but it seems you have abandoned ship.” Alpha Rip looked around, annoyed.

“It’s me that you want.” I said, avoiding Alec’s eyes. His hands were being tied and he was being forced to

knee beside his warriors.

“It really is.” Darin grabbed my face and forced his l*ps against mine. I still had control of my b*dy so I did what I have been wanting to do. Bringing my knee up, I smashed his balls. “F UCK” He screamed as he doubled over. A warrior came over and slapped me acrossed the face, busting my l*p open.

Within the same second, a gunshot rang out and blood splattered across my face. As a b*dy fell against me, I realized the warrior that hit me was now dead, as I wore his blood.

“How many times do I have to tell you f uckers that you do not lay a hand on her!” Alpha Rip looked incredibly pis sed off. “Get up. You are embarrassing yourself.” He kicked Darin in the leg.

“Just take me and leave them all alone.” I watched as something was sprayed in Alec’s face. As much as he tried not in inhale, he was forced to. The anger in his eyes were obvious but they weren’t black anymore. They had given him wolfsbane and took away his wolf. Looking around, they had done the same to all the warriors.

“My dear, it seems Alpha Marc doesn’t know how to attack but I sure do.” Alpha Rip pointed the gun at Henry and fired.

“NO!” I jumped in front of his gun. “Just take me. I am the one you want. Take me. What kind of Alpha shoots an unarmed man after you taken away their wolves? A coward one.” I spit. I still had my wolf and I knew she flashed before my eyes.

“You know what, you are right. I do enjoy the battle and this was just too easy.” Alpha Rip pointed the gun at Alpha Marc.








###Chapter 242
The gun went off quickly before I could react. It hit him in the stomach, causing him to fall forward,

gasping for air.

“Let’s load up! Take her with us!” Dark grabbed my arm as he pulled me along. I was able to give Alec one last look before I was shoved in the trunk and the door was slammed shut. The engine started up and we

were peeling out within seconds. noveldrama

It only took a few minutes but I felt the shift of power. I felt Alpha Marc die and Alec become alpha now.

Making me, the luna. My wolf instantly grew, ready to fight. However, with their warriors and mine not

having their wolves, I had to wait till the right time.

Alec POV

“KRISTEN!” It me a second to the rope off since they took away my wolf. They were already out the gate by the time I was able to stand up and take a few steps.

“Alec.” I heard dad spit. I was f ucking pis sed. She willingly allowed them to take her but it wasn’t like we

had a choice. If she would have fought, we all would have died. She saved us.

“THE F UCK HAPPENED?” I roared as I turned and looked at my dad. Blood was starting to run down his

cheek.

“MARC!” Mom was screaming as she held onto dad but he was only looking at me.

“I’m sorry, son.” He said before his eyes rolled back. The pain instantly stabbed my heart as he died but

the power shifted immediately. I knew I wasn’t feeling the full effects but I knew I was now the Alpha.

“Move them and then we are leaving.” I ordered. My men were working on freeing themself at this point. The few that got free picked up my dad and Henry and carried them to our morgue.

Twice now she had been kidnapped and I couldn’t stop it. It all happened so quickly that I was at a loss. Alpha…” A warrior came up to me, without even thinking, I turned around and punched him square in the

mouth.

“WHAT THE F UCK HAPPENED? WERE YOU ALL TAKING A F CKING NAP WHEN THEY BROKE DOWN

THE GATE? THERE ISN’T AN OUNCE OF BLOOD ON ANYONE!” I was seeing red as I walked over to my vehicle. “GET A F UCKING VEHICLE AND MOVE!” I yelled. Everyone instantly ran to the garage but I wasn’t about to f ucking wait. I was done waiting. My father allowed this to f ucking happen with his s hit of information he was promised.

My foot never left the gas peddle as I peeled out. As I went over the hills, the tires never even touched the

Within the same second, a gunshot rang out and blood splattered across my face. As a b*dy fell against

me, I realized the warrior that hit me was now dead, as I wore his blood.

“How many times do I have to tell you f uckers that you do not lay a hand on her!” Alpha Rip looked

incredibly pis sed off. “Get up. You are embarrassing yourself.” He kicked Darin in the leg.

“Just take me and leave them all alone.” I watched as something was sprayed in Alec’s face. As much as

at Alpha Marc.








###Chapter 0243

"Wolfsbane, Alpha." The warrior next to him said.

*He tied us up and brought Alpha Marc in front of him. He kept asking where everyone was in our pack and why it was empty. He kept asking where Luna Kristen was. Alpha Marc and everyone here didn't tell him anything. However, Alpha Alec and Luna Kristen showed up. They immediately sprayed Alpha Alec with the spray and forced him down. Luna Kristen jumped in front of the gun and demanded to be taken to spare our lives. Even called Alpha Rip a coward for wanting to kill us when we were wolfless. Alpha Darin forced himself on Luna Kristen but she kneed him in the balls. A warrior slapped her and Alpha Rip instantly killed his warrior for hitting her. He also killed on of our warriors. In the end, he took Luna Kristen and shot Alpha Marc. Alpha Marc is dead."

I didn't realize the audience we gained. There were a few gasps and cries from people. "Alpha Rip has my sister." Colt said dangerously calm. Penny ran back inside.

"Where the fuck is Jasper?" I asked, realizing he wasn't here.

*Alpha Rip put Beta Jasper in another trunk. He has both Beta Jasper and Luna Kristen." I couldn't contain my anger, I was able to punch three guys out before two people grabbed me and pulled me off my men.

*HERE!" Penny came running out with a black bag. She came right up to me and stopped. I was still being held back but she didn't seem to care. Grabbing a bottle out of the bag, she tipped it up to my lips and forced me to drink. The liquid touched my tongue and vanished.

Pain erupted down my spine as I fell to the ground. With one knee on the ground and one hand, I felt my wolf make his appearance. He was fucking pissed off and nothing was going to stand in his way. I knew my eyes were black.

"Warriors, prepare for battle." Colt said. I looked up and his face was stoic but he lifted an eyebrow at me upon seeing my eyes. He went to turn and walk away but another car came barreling down the road.

I was standing up and ready for a fight when Emmy got out of the drivers seat. A young boy got out from the passenger seat. "Colt!" She ran forward. I could see how much her belly has grown.

"What is it, Emmy?" Colt had incredible restraint.

Emmy stopped and looked around at the scene in front of her. Her words got caught in her throat as she looked at me. Tears were in her eyes but all she probably knew is my dad was dead and I was now her alpha.

*Alpha Colt! I broke through the firewalls! I'm in!" The little kid must be Beckham.

*Warriors, prepare!" Colt looked at me before turning and walking inside. Emmy, Beckham, Jacob and I all followed him to his office.

Kristen POVnoveldrama

*Come on! Time to see what I have in store for you!" Someone grabbed my arm and ripped me from the trunk. It was unusually dark but once I saw we were in a parking garage, it made more sense. Someone else was being pulled out of a trunk. It took a second to realize it was Jasper but he was unconscious. A warrior tossed him over his shoulder as Darin painfully griped my arm and pulled me along beside him.

As hard as I tried to look around, there wasn't any distinguishing features that would tell me where we were. From my calculations, we were only in the car for about an hour or two at most. We went over some railroad tracks but I lost track of our location when they turned so fast that I was tossed to the other wise of the trunk. My head hit something metal and I felt some blood start to drip down.

*Welcome to our research lab." Alpha Rip seemed proud of this. As soon as he opened the door, I was blinded by the lights. Everything was white. The floor, walls, ceiling and even the lights were a bright white color. People that were in there where wearing a hazmat suit. Their faces were completely covered, expect for their eyes.






###Chapter 244
The first part of some chemicals they were mixing. Multiple beakers were filled with different color

liquids. Some where using bunsen burner to heat some of these up.

“What is all this?” I asked, in slight horror and in fascination.

“Different recipes. This one is the wolfsbane spray we use to quickly suppress the wolf. We also have

different poisons and our latest creation…” Alpha Rip put on a glove and picked up what looked like a black bath bomb. “This little bomb will release a deadly toxin into your drinking water. Just drop this in a

water tank and the entire city will be dead as soon as their l*ps touch it.”

“What’s in it?” I asked.

“It’s a family secret.” Alpha Rip looked at me that made me know I needed to stop asking questions. Darin pulled me out of that room and down a hallway. “There are many things that we are looking into. noveldrama

This one, I know Alec will be most fond of learning about.” Alpha Rip paused in front of a door before

opening it for me to look into.

There was multiple men hunched over welding stations with welders masks on. I didn’t understand at first until I got closer and realized it was a little bee. “Make the connection now? This little guy will fly to its target and blow up. It releases a deadly sleeping powder that will knock the person out cold for hours

or forever.”

I turned my head to look at Alpha Rip when I realized how many they had made. The entire wall was covered in a shelf. Thousands of these little bees, sat, waiting for their mission. They looked so realistic that if you put a regular bee beside it, you might miss the difference.

“This next room might intrigue you.” Darin laughed as he pulled me out of that room and to the next.

Alpha Rip opened the door and Darin pushed me inside.

There was what looked like a bird sitting on the table. A black screen was directly in front of me and nothing was playing. On the left wall was the entire layout to our pack. They did what I did and used the pictures to map out what it looks like. They had three tunnels circled. Each location named, like pool or packhouse. However, it was the bird that disturbed me. With shaky hands, I grabbed it gently and lifted it in the air. Immediately, something started moving on the black screen in front of me. The higher I raised the bird, the realization hit me. It was a drone but shaped and disguised as a bird.

Even if we were looking for a drone, no one would question a bird in the air. Turning it over, I saw the tiniest camera lens. Suddenly, it moved to my face. “I can control it with this.” Darin came around the table and showed me the remote. It was a standard X-box controller that he had reprogramed to the bird.

He demonstrated how he zoomed in and easily controlled it. “What is the range of this?” I asked







###Chapter 245
Judging by the look on their faces, I was not going to like this. The hallway was dark but the footsteps ! heard coming down the hall were quicker than I wanted to hear. I expected to hear screaming or yelling but I didn’t hear any of that.

Darin opened the door as Alpha Rip put his finger over his l*ps, signaling for me to be quiet. The room was

pitch black except for one chair that sat in the middle of the room.

“Alpha Rip, you wanted to see me?”

“Yes, Thomas. Please come in. I believe you know our guest.” There was a thud before the lights turned on. Jasper had been tossed on the ground but his face was pointed upward. “Actually, you may not know Ms. Kristen here. Let me introduce her, after all, she is your Luna now.” Alpha Rip grabbed my hair and yanked me forward into the light.

Judd stood in front of me. To his credit, he kept his face passive the entire time. “I don’t know these

people.” He said in a confused voice.

Alpha Rip nodded to the warriors who grabbed Judd and drug him to the chair. “I did hope this would go

smoothly.”

“What are you doing?” Judd yelled.

“Thomas…” Alpha Rip started.

“Dad… don’t forget his real name.” Darin said. He was standing behind me. I didn’t even realize he was there so when he spoke, I jumped a little. Darin looked down at me and laughed. His hands grabbed my

hips and pulled me against him. “Don’t worry, baby. This will be over soon and I will comfort you.” He

whispered quietly in my ear.

My l*p started quivering as he placed a soft k*ss to my neckbut my fist balled up. Anger was winning. I felt his member stiffen behind me but thankfully his attention was refocused on the scene in front of him.

“That’s right. Judd…” Alpha Rip clapped his hands together as if to make a show of this. Once Judd was

tied down, a warrior spayed the mist in front of his face, making his wolf vanish.

Judd’s face didn’t pale but he got pis sed off. “What is going on here?”

Alpha Rip snapped his fingers and the lights flickered on. The one thing in this room other than us, was a

baseball pitching matching and it was directly in front of Judd. Judd’s face fell as he realized what was noveldrama

going to happen and started struggling against the rope.

Alpha Rip walked up to the machine and turned it on. “This is how this is going to work I am going to ask

At one point, I looked over and it read, 105mph.

The warriors walked up and ripped his shirt off and his cut his pants off his legs, leaving him in only his boxers. “Were you put under as a spy from Alpha Marc?”

“Just kill me because you aren’t getting s hit from me!” Judd spit. His eyes never left the machine as Alpha Rip bend over and picked up a ball. Placing it in the machine, the ball flew out and hit Judd in the stomach. Instantly, spit went flying as Judd doubled over in agonizing pain. By the time he sat up, his stomach had already formed a light blue spot where the ball hit. I could even see marks from the stitches on the ball.

“I actually already knew that answer so it wasn’t a big deal. You see, Kristen… Judd was placed as a spy for your father-in-law. However, I had downloaded an app to his phone when he didn’t realize that made all text messages come to my phone. I saw every exchange between them. You want to know how I have managed to stay ahead of Marc every turn, that’s why. I knew you guys were going to hit the garage so I moved the entire business locations.” Alpha Rip smiled at me.






###Chapter 246
So Judd didn’t betray us but Alpha Rip found a way to spy on the spy. “I thought you had help with Angela to kidnap me?”

“Ah, your brain is something special.” Alpha Rip came over to me and put his hand on my head, like my father used to. “We did indeed. You see, Darin was actually Angela’s mate.”

Gasping, I took a step away from Darin in complete shock. “Why are you so shocked? Angela was a good lay but she loved Alec and I wanted you. It really worked out in our favor. She told us about the tunnel that was already in place. Since our tunnels weren’t 100% finished and we hadn’t fully collected all data, we went with her recommendation of using that one.”

“We couldn’t have our other tunnels found already. That would ruin our plans.” Alpha Rip laughed and walked back to the machine.

“Did you and Angela reject each other?” I asked.

“No. We both didn’t want to risk our wolves. As long as she stays away from me then I don’t give a hit what she does. However, I heard she is in your cells so it’s not like she can go f uck whoever she wanted. It really has worked out for the best. I get to keep my wolf, I don’t have to feel the pain of her f ucking anyone and I still get to get you.” Darin was looking directly at me.

“Now that you have learned the truth, do you want to put a ball in as punishment for his lack of awareness?” Alpha Rip held up a ball for me.

“No.” I said and backed away against the wall.

“Very well.” Alpha Rip put the ball in himself. I watched in horror as it hit Judd in the center of his chest. His face turned purple as he screamed out in agony.noveldrama

“Any other questions you have?” Alpha Rip asked, pulling my attention away from Judd.

“The rogues. Why did you send them to kidnap me?”

“My s tupid son has much to learn about getting s hit done.” Alpha Rip shook his head at Darin.

“Why me? It can’t be just because you like how I look.” I kept looking between the two men. At this

question, they both turned and looked at me and smiled.

“We have a certain situation that needs address and you would be the perfect person to help me with it.”

Alpha Rip tossed a ball to one of his warriors. “Finish up here and clean up. I don’t want to see any

stains.”

Darin grabbed my arm and pulled me out, no one picked up Jasper but left him on the floor. Alpha Rip shut the door, completely drowning out Judd’s screams of pain. We walked around a couple hallways and turned a few corners when we walked into a room with a massive screen. It was the entire length of the wall, floor to ceiling. There was pictures of different buildings, different people and even blueprints of other inventions. Pretty much everyone I loved or knew had their picture on the wall with some writing

that I couldn’t read.

“This room is called M.A.R.C room or Midnight Aerial Rotoscaping Camera. Ironic… I know. This high tech

camera allows me to get high resolution video of whatever I desire. In this case, my target has been

someone that is a little closer to my heart.”

A picture of Penny filled the entire screen. “What?”

“You see, I have learned a few things over the years. I don’t have a mate currently. Not because she died

or anything but because she never marked me. I marked her so the bond would be formed enough that I

could survive but she never marked me so I still have my free will. She is safe, don’t worry but that isn’t

what’s important right now. What’s important is what happened in the first year of us finding eachother.”

“St upid b itch.” Darin grumbled and took a seat. He looked like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum.






###Chapter 247
“Anyway..” Alpha Rip took a deep breath and ignored his son. “Do you know the name Alpha Ivan?”

“Isn’t that your dad?” I asked trying to remember.

“Close but no. That is the most common misconception that people believe. Alpha Ivan is actually my

mate’s father. Cassie was the only child born to Alpha Ivan. When he met his… untimely death, Cassie

took over the Alpha role. However, since I was her mate, she eventually agreed to pass over the title of

Alpha to me.”

I had a sick feeling in my stomach about what he meant about agreed. Knowing him, he abused her

probably emotionally, physically and me ntally. “Oh no.” I whispered.

“You got it!” Alpha Rip snapped his fingers. “However, Cassie had a boyfriend that she was in love with or

some s hit like that. When I met her, she was already five weeks pregnant. Scared for her unborn child, she

tried to pass the child off as mine. However, when the baby was born and to my surprise, the baby looked

identical to her real father.”

Alpha clicked another button and a man shared the screen with Penny. She looked like a female version

of him. It was scary how close they resembled each other. However, I was right when I saw that photo of

Judd and him at the bar.

“Do you know anything about werewolf law, Kristen?” Alpha Rip’s voice changed. He was no longer telling

a fun story.

“The first born of alpha blood is the sole heir to the title.” I said in a flat voice. That makes Penny the heir

to Midnight River Pack.

“Exactly. I ordered for that baby to be killed. It is my greatest regret that I did not do it myself when I saw

the little f ucker but that is another story. However, Cassie managed to get word out to her boyfriend and

together they got the baby out. It took me years to find the kid and be able to track her down.”

“I’m confused. Why did you build tunnels to Alpha Marc’s pack if you were after Penny?”

“Well, that is the million dollar question.” Alpha Rip stood up and started pacing around. “You see, Penny’s

dad is working with the very same man that is being tenderized by a baseball machine. They have been

working together and for Alpha Marc for decades. Slimy little f ucker. When my s tupid son wanted to use

rogues, he asked Judd to hire some to make an impact. Judd, still playing both sides, had Zac that is his

name by the way Zac organized an attack to kidnap you. We were going to trade for Penny but Alpha

Rup looked at Dann in complete anger. “THAT IS WHY WE DON’T F UCKING USE ROGUES!

“Let me get this straight. The turmets were built as a future plan to take down Alpha Marc when the time

because you have been trying to get your hands on Zac for f ucking years. So, you decided to kidnap me to issue a trade for Penny to kill her so Darin would take over as Alpha? Thus drawing out Zac for you to kill and since she is now mated to Colt, you would get all three packs.”

“It’s it wonderful with years of planning come together nicely.”

“Plans change.” Darin stood up. “After seeing you, I wanted you for a mate. If I kill Alec, I will now be named Alpha of that pack without having to fully attack now, or we could still do that.”

“Long story short, kill Penny, Alec and Colt and gain all this area for yourself.” I clarified.

“Correct.” Alpha Rip smiled. “However, we do need your help with the programing of this.” Hitting a button, an aerial shot of Blue Fang back came into view with a target covering it all. The worst part, it was all live footage.







###Chapter 248
Warning! Possible trigging events ahead!

“What?” I said breathlessly.

“Well, you guys moved everyone to one pack so it will just be easiest to level the entire pack. I have acquired a very large explosive. Unfortunately, we have not been break through their firewalls. In order to detonate it, I need this the nine digit password. That is where you come into play.”

“What makes you think I am going to help you?” I stared in horror as I watched people come and go around the entire pack. They looked like little white dots but they were people.

“I figured you would need some incentive.” Alpha Rip snapped his fingers and the screen changed. The video being shown was an image of Judd. His face was completely flattened by the baseballs. He was missing his teeth and there was massive gas hes acrossed his b*dy. If I didn’t see what was happening, I would have no idea who that even was.

The warriors untied him and allowed his b*dy to fall on the floor. Dragging in off to the side, two more warriors came into view with someone who was struggling against them. After punching him a few times to get him to settle down, they got him seated and tied down. It wasn’t until they walked away did I realize it was Jasper.

“No…” I whispered as I took a step back.

“You can stop this.” Darin took a step forward. noveldrama

“How?” My heart sank as I watched a ball hit him in the shoulder..

“Chose me. Bare my pup, not Alec’s. I have come to agree that we will not mark each other so it doesn’t matter if you reject him. Plus, I rather your wolf not die so have my pup.”

My mouth dropped open. I either allowed him to have S** with me and save Jasper or sat here and watched Jasper be completely flattened and he would probably still force me to have S** with him. Quickly, I started formulating a plan. There was no f ucking way I was going to allow either to happen but I was scared s hitless and pis sed off.

“JUST STOP HURTING HIM!” I yelled as I watched a ball hit Jasper in the eye. Blood splattered everywhere.

“Good choice!” Alpha Rip pushed a button. “Stop.” He said into the microphone and clear relief spread across Jasper as he hunched over. His breathing was relaxing.

“Glad you feel that way. Dad has some stuff to attend to so I think we should make sure you will stay true

“What about Jasper?” I asked as I struggled to stay on my feet.

“I guess not having your wolf is making you clumsy.” Darin laughed. It was then I realized he was under the impression I was sprayed when I wasn’t. I felt a little better about the situation I was put in but how I was going to get out of this mess, I had no idea.

“Where are you taking me?” I kept faking on falling so I could get a look at what was around.

“I anticipated your choice and have set up a little spot for us. That way, you can show me how honest you are being with me. If you do not satisfy me, I will inform my father and he will continue on with Jasper.”

I kept telling myself I needed to stay strong. I needed him to be at his most vulnerable in order for me to

overpower him. He needed to think I agreed to his plan. Alec’s face flashed in my mind, telling me all I needed to do was stay alive. This was not the end of my story.

“Here we are!” I was so lost in my thoughts that when Darin slammed me against the wall, my breath was knocked from me. His l*ps covered mine as his had ripped my romper. Exposing my bra, his hand painfully griped me. I could feel his di ck pressed firmly against me







###Chapter 249
“S-shouldn’t w-we go inside?” I asking in a shaky voice as he moved down my neck. It took everything in

me to not protest against his touching.

“You are right. I want you laying under me.” Darin unlocked the door and pushed me inside. All I saw was

a mattress and chains on the wall before he tossed me down.

Before I could even react, Darin fl*pped me over and was on top of me. My Romper was completely

ripped off, instantly causing me to panic. My heart started racing as Darin’s filthy hands ran down my

b*dy. A little whimper escaped my l*ps before I felt a fierceness build up in me.

“NO!” I yelled, causing him to stop. He had just forced my legs apart with his head inches from me. noveldrama

“What?” His face smiled as he came up to me. “Are you rejecting this?” His hand slapped me so fast

across the mouth that I was stunned. Blood filled my mouth as I turned back around to look at him.

“I didn’t say that! I- I prefer to be on top.” The lie quickly came to me.

“Okay.” Darin stood up and pulled his s hit and pants off before taking his underwear off. His d ick bounced

as it was finally free. I couldn’t help but compare. Alec was thicker and much bigger than his little penis.

“Alright, let’s see what that mouth can do.” Darin laid down as I moved over to the side.

My hands shook as I reached up and grabbed the chains. “I want to use these.”

Darin’s hand painfully griped my wrist. He squeezed hard enough until there was a snap. “Don’t f ucking

think about it.”

Cradling my hand against me, I kept trying to think of a plan. My wolf was ready for a fight. I knew my

heeling would help with the pain but I didn’t know what to do.

“Suck it.” Darin grabbed the back of my head and shoved it down until his d ick was pressed against my

cheek. Darin’s claws sank into my hip and left long and deep scratches down my thigh to my knee. “Get

your as s over here.”

Not wanting him to penetrate me, my hand quickly wrapped around his d ick and I shoved his d ick in my

mouth. His head snapped back as his pressure lightened up on my head. He moved me up and down as

tears filled my ears. When he pushed himself deep in my throat, my fangs descended and I bit down hard.

Blood filled my mouth and I felt his b*dy twist to get me off of him but I held on. His fist hit me in the ribs

a few times before he grabbed my head and pulled me off his di ck. Making sure my fangs were deep in

his d ick, they left huge ga shes the entire length.

“What about Jasper?” I asked as I struggled to stay on my feet.

“I guess not having your wolf is making you clumsy.” Darin laughed. It was then I realized he was under the impression I was sprayed when I wasn’t. I felt a little better about the situation I was put in but how I

was going to get out of this mess, I had no idea.

“Where are you taking me?” I kept faking on falling so I could get a look at what was around.

“I anticipated your choice and have set up a little spot for us. That way, you can show me how honest you

are being with me. If you do not satisfy me, I will inform my father and he will continue on with Jasper.”

I kept telling myself I needed to stay strong. I needed him to be at his most vulnerable in order for me to

overpower him. He needed to think I agreed to his plan. Alec’s face flashed in my mind, telling me all !

needed to do was stay alive. This was not the end of my story.

“Here we are!” I was so lost in my thoughts that when Darin slammed me against the wall, my breath was

knocked from me. His l*ps covered mine as his had ripped my romper. Exposing my bra, his hand painfully

griped me. I could feel his di ck pressed firmly against me.






###Chapter 250
“She’s gone!”

“Darin is dead!”

“FIND HER! I WANT HER ALIVE!” Alpha Rip’s voice boomed across the walls as the door handle started shaking. “CHECK EVERYROOM. SHE CAN’T BE FAR!” I heard shouting as everyone sc attered out.

As the footsteps went off into the distance, I was able to look around at the room I was in. There wasn’t any way I could stay here. I needed to keep going. As much as I wanted to get out, I couldn’t leave without Jasper. If they haven’t figured out the code yet, they might not be able to. However, the only way for me to completely take it off line was to use the code. The code I didn’t even know.

This room was completely empty. Three offices chairs and one folding table but nothing worth anything. Not even a fire extinguisher to use as a weapon.

Pressing my ear to the door, there wasn’t any sounds or footsteps. Slowly, unlocking the door, I peaked out. There wasn’t any nerves, only anger. My wolf wanted to take over. Quietly slipping out, I started tiptoeing down the hall. I was very much aware that I was only in my bra and underwear with no shoes. As I came up to the corner, something red caught my attention. I wasn’t even sure what I was doing but I reached out and pulled the fire alarm.

Instantly, the alarm went off. Red lights started shrieking as it turned around and around. Men started shouted and running out of rooms in the distance. I kept trying to creep my way back the way Darin brought me but men kept coming and going. Every time I would see an opening, someone would turn around the corner. More than once, they ran by me. My heart was pounding but they were more focused on something else to pay attention to their surroundings.

“Where is she?” I heard Alpha Rip’s voice boom down a hallway.

S hit! Grabbing a door, my hand shook as I tried to open it but it was locked. Moving to the next door, it

was locked as well. “S hit!” I whispered out loud.

“That bit ch is done f ucking with my s hit!” His footsteps sounded like they were right around the corner.

“Sir! There is movement on our northern perimeter.” The footsteps stopped.

“What?” Alpha Rip asked, dangerously calm.

“There is movement on the northern side. The front line cameras picked up something.”

“Do I have to f ucking do everything around here?” He roared. “Find her or I will kill you.” He said before I heard his footsteps fade away.

+15 BONUS My wolf extended her claws, knowing a warrior was going to come around the corner. As if right now cue, he turned and had to double take as he saw me. However, I was quicker and sliced his throat. His scream was caught as blood sprayed me. Dropping to his knees, I just left him there. There wouldn’t be any way to clean up the blood.

Jasper was just right down the hall in front of me now. Carefully, I turned the corner to see if anyone was there. Not sure if the Moon Goddess finally started to bless me, but the hallway was empty. As quickly as I could without making any sounds, I creeped down the hallway as I stayed bent over. noveldrama

Grabbing the door handle, it was thankfully unlocked. Immediately, going inside, I only had a second of relief before I realized there was a warrior standing there with a baseball in his hand.

Jasper looked at me before looking at the warrior. He could only see out of one eye and it looked like he took a few more balls to the chest but he was alive. The warrior dropped the ball and came after me.

###Chapter 251
Even with my wolf, I haven’t worked out in weeks. My muscles screamed in protest as I kept ducking out of the way. Jasper’s instructions fell on deaf ears as I kept my focus to not get hit. Feeling his hands grab me, my b*dy was suddenly flying through the air. My back cracked against the wall before it slid down. noveldrama

“F uck.” I groaned but I didn’t have time to recover. Lwatched as the warrior grabbed his radio to tell Alpha Rip where I was. Jumping up. my wolf forced my legs to spring forward onto his back. Snapping his neck in one motion before he pressed the call button.

-As he fell to the ground, I stag gered to the floor as well. My breathing

was heavy as I crawled the to the door and locked it. Just in case someone decided to come and check how things were going in here.

“Kristen..” Jasper’s voice finally invaded my ears. With my back against the wall, I was trying to catch my breath.

As soon as he said my name, my eyes met his only visible one. “We… got to get out of.. here.” There was a sharp pain on my side. I think he fractured a rip.

“Where are we?

“No idea.” Using the handle, my b*dy protested as I stood up. My adrenaline was going but I was very much aware over my lack of physical activity.

After gaining my balance, I walked over to Jasper to get him freed. It took me a second to unhook the chains but I did it. Jasper fell forward, clutching his chest. He was on his hands and knees with his face in the ground as he groaned. “S hiiit…”

“Come on. We need to get you to a hospital.” I said as I put my hand.

nau to clench

my teeth together so I wouldn’t cry out over the pain in my side. Jasper needed me more than a broken rip.

“How do we get out of here?” Jasper asked through gritted teeth.

“Quickly.” I helped him walked over to the door.

“I mean, which way.” My hand was on the door k nob.

“No idea but we can’t stay here.” Looking at Jasper, we were both standing in our underwear with our b loody bodies using eachother for support. “Ready?”

“As much as I’ll ever be.” Jasper nodded as I opened the door.

Without even looking, we turned left and ran as fast as we could. It was hard between the pain and carrying most of Jasper’s weight, I kept stepping on sharp objects that cut my food. I didn’t stop, I kept going.

“THERE SHE IS!” I heard behind me.

“Don’t look, keep going!” Jasper yelled. There was a sign for stairs up ahead. Our running didn’t stop as we ran into the door, pushing it open. Thankfully, the door weighed enough that our momentum was stopped so we didn’t fall down the steps that were closer than what I expected.

“Down!” I yelled as Jasper and I started down the stairs. We made it down a flight of stairs before the door opened with a bang. Slamming so hard against the wall, concrete dust fell down on us.

“They went down!” Pulling out his walkie talkie, we could hear the warrior radio to everyone. “She is on the stairs, moving down to the third level!”

I didn’t stop. We kept going down. Each time we went down, I reached

W3

Jasper lost his footing and we fell down a few steps. I heard something snap and Jasper cry out in pain. Jasper’s ankle was turned a different direction that caused him to fall down again. My knee fit the floor extremely hard.

“F uck!” Jasper grabbed his ankle.

“Sorry, Jasper.” I said. Without waiting, my hands wrapped around his ankle and snapped it back into place

“HOLY F UCK, KRISTEN!” Jasper growled as I grabbed his arm and pulled him up once again. The guards were getting close as I pulled Jasper the rest of the way to the door. It said EXIT in big red letters.







###Chapter 252
“MOVE, JASPER!” I yelled as we both pushed the door open. The dark of the night greeted us. Wind whipped at my hair and stung my cuts. The back part of the building emptied into an alley. There was some street parking, trash cans but nothing that would help us hide. We only made it twenty yards when the door opened again.

“Dear, little Kristen.” Alpha Rip’s voice sent chills down my spin. We instantly stopped trying to run. Turning to look at him, I saw the guns. “I must admit, I didn’t expect that from you.” Alpha Rip was standing just outside the door with multiple men. They all had guns pointed at us, waiting for the reply. “You killed my son.” His face morphed as he said the words.

“You killed Darin?” Jasper asked, looking at me.

“Ripped his heart out with my own hands. I guess you should make sure that everyone is sprayed before you send them to get rapped by your son.”

“I will be sure to not show you any mercy as I take your life.” Alpha Rip looked down at his hands. There was a 38 Special he was noveldrama

“If you kill Jasper or me, I will not help you.” I said, using the only bargaining tool I had.

“We will see about this.” Alpha Rip nodded to someone behind us. Hands instantly wrapped around my neck as well as Jasper’s.

As he pulled us back into the building, my braid tried to work out a plan. I could transform into my wolf but that wouldn’t be enough to kill all these men. She would be a massive target, giving them more

surface area to hit. Jasper was completely defenseless as he was being drug ahead of me. With his ankle not healing fast, he was

Distracted looked at Jasper and I tripped over the first step going up the stairs. “S tupid b itch!” The warrior growled before punching me in the already broken rib. As much as I expected it, it still took my

breath away.

My wolf was slowly trying to take over. Alpha Rip knew I had her so I didn’t try to hide her anger as we looked up at the warrior. Sierra took over. She didn’t shift but she extended her claws and lashed out as the warrior bent over to pick me up. Slashing his throat open, more blood sprayed down my b*dy.

“Kristen!” I heard Jasper yell. Looking over just in time to see Alpha Rip stomp over to me and punch me in the temple.

The world went fuzzy. Not fully passing out but black did dance in my vision as I was hauled over Alpha Rip’s shoulders and carried up the stairs. As much as I tried to focus, it was hard. Blood dripped down my forehead, however, I wasn’t sure if it was mine or not.

With more force than probably needed, my b*dy was tossed down on the floor. Flat scratchy carpet caught my fall. The only thought I could focus on was how that was going to leave a rug burn.

“IT ISN’T THAT F UCKING HARD!” Alpha Rip was yelling as he grabbed me by the hair and pulled me up.

“FOCUS!” Slapping me across the face, he tried my hardest to focus.

“F uck…you…” I said between my heavy breathing.

“That’s a good girl.” Walking behind me, he pushed my chair in. “Now, I want the F UCKING CODE!”

In front of me was a variety of numbers and buttons with abbreviations that I didn’t even understand. There was nine boxes that were blank, waiting for a number. “I’m not a hacker.” I said as I

Wrong answer.” Alpha Rip said. I heard him c ock back his gun. My head snapped over just in time to see him point it at Jasper and pull the trigger.

“F UCK!!!” Jasper yelled and he grabbed his ankle. It was the same ankle he had already broken. It might not be saveable now.

“I. Want. The. F ucking. Code.” Alpha Rip’s eyes were black as he looked at me. “Next will be his knee and I will keep going up.”







###Chapter 253
“Don’t do it.” Jasper looked at me through is one good eye. There was fear and acceptance in his b*dy language. My b*dy flinched as Alpha Rip pistol whipped Jasper. He wasn’t knocked out but he was dazed. A warrior cut some duct tape and wrapped it around his mouth.

“Now, get me the f ucking code.” Alpha Rip looked at me.

Turning my attention back to the screen, it had the logo for the United States of America on it. “Stole it from the humans?” I asked sarcastically as I pressed enter on the key board. I might be a genius but I was not a hacker. I had no idea how to cover my tracks or even do this.

Alpha Rip c ocked the hammer back. “Is that a problem?” He asked in a very calm voice.

“Not for me.” I said, very aware of how many eyes were on me. Okay, I took a deep breath and tried to focus. I had taken multiple classes on computer programing to boost my college applications, so I had an idea of how this even worked.

There was a kid in there and clicked the wrong part and managed to break into the highschool’s system. I just needed to do the same thing … just on a national level. My fingers tapped on the keyboard for a moment before they started clicking away. However had tried to do this, had managed to make it through a few firewalls but were stuck

at one.

Clicking on the URL, I tried to put it in another server. “You can’t do that, it won’t work that way! I already tried.”

Looking behind me, a warrior was standing over me, looking at what I was doing. Annoyance and fear poked me. If he understood this, he would know that I would be trying to f uck this whole situation up.

Alpha Rip…. Please shoot him.” I said before turning around.

“Excuse me?” Alpha Rip asked, with a little amusement.

“I don’t need someone looking over my shoulder telling me what I am doing wrong when he couldn’t even do it correctly.”

I was just joking but when the gun went off, my head snapped back so fast that it popped more times that I ever felt before. The warrior glared as me as he fell to his knees and eventually to his side. Breathing his last breath, his eyes never left me.

“Continue.” Alpa Rip said.

“Um, okay.” I was a little shaken after that but I tried to keep focusing for Jasper’s sake. Changing a glance, he was perfectly still but his chest was still rising and falling slightly. His eyes were closed but blood still ran down his face.

It took me another five minutes to figure out how to break through their firewall but I managed to do it. A combinations of numbers and letters filled the screen. Moving up with such speed that you barely could read each one.

I wasn’t trying to find the code but make enough disturbance that I would be contacted by someone. “This is taking too long.” Alpha Rip said. His voice was getting agitated.

“I’m not going to the store fore milk. I told you I wasn’t a hacker. You are going to have to give me a minute.” I said through gritted teeth.

“Work faster or Jasper won’t have a knee along with his ankle.” Alpha Rip whisper in my ear. –

“I’m trying.” I said as I leaned away from him. My fingers flew across the keyboard. noveldrama

“Luna. Can you hear me?” My b*dy jumped in surprise as one of our

“YES!” I said as I tried to gain my composure.

“What was that?” Alpha Rip asked.

“I’m cold. I am literally in a bra and underwear.” I lied.

BAM! The gun went off and Jasper cried out again. My mouth dropped as I looked at more blood coming from Jasper’s knee.

Mrs. Smith

Thank you all for reading!






###Chapter 254
“The f uck?”

“You aren’t working fast enough. Apparently you lack motivation.

Next one will be his heart.” Alpha Rip c ocked the gun again and got on Jasper’s level.

“I’m working!” I said angrily.

“Listen. We are surrounding the building.” I was too happy and worried to react too much.

“I will keep them busy as long as I can but you have to quietly penetrate the building. They are already aware that you were coming.” I said as I tried to open this other link. A single number popped up. 8. Typing an 8 into the first box, Alpha Rip was happy.

“Alpha Rip, we are being surrounded. They are not friendlies.” A warrior slammed the door open, making a bright light blind us for a second.

“Take care of it.” Alpha Rip said without looking at him. Two warriors walked out with him. Daring a glance, there was still four warriors i this room.

As I was typing out another algorithm, I was finally able to get the U.S.A military to respond. He had placed it in the codes so unless your knew what you were looking at, you wouldn’t see it.

-see your plea, follow instructions-

Relief and happiness filled me. I was starting to get worried they didn’t see it or I didn’t do it right. Clicking the link that popped up, it lead me to another screen that looked exactly like the same one. However, this one had some data that I knew was false.

They responded with another message. However, this message was my coordinates that I needed to put into the system to program the false attack. The military wanted me to fake it like it was real to buy us time.

“The U.S.A military is on their way. We need to get out A.S.A.P.” I said in the mind-link to the warrior.

“Colt said we are okay. He is on his way here but we need to stall.”

“There is a bomb here. If this goes off…” I replied.

“We aren’t leaving you.” He said instantly.

More numbers were popping up as I followed the obvious. instructions. 4. 2. I felt Alpha Rip come over to me and watch me work. At this point, it was easy to pretend to struggle. Typing random letters and numbers that made zero sense but Alpha Rip was hanging on my every push of the keyboard.

O was next before 8 came back up. I just needed four more numbers. Since Alpha Rip was watching me, I had to get more creative on sending my message. This time, I asked for an ETA.

Noises were being heard in the building now. We had officially. penetrated. Guns and growls were vibrating the walls. The warriors were getting antsy and Alpha Rip was souly focused on me. Placing his hand on my shoulder, he squeezed hard.

“That’s it. Hurry up.” He growled.

7. Came up next. Putting each one into the box, I glanced over at Jasper again. He was looking at me with his only good eye. There wasn’t anyway to read his expression from the blood and with how swollen his face was but I knew he thought I was achieving Alpha Rip’s goal. noveldrama

3….9… “One more…” Alpha Rip was excited. As soon as the last

the way and hit launch with a closed fist.

The room lit up green. Sounds of ignition grew. My heart started pounding as doubt filled me. That was, until it died and a red X filled the screen with a skull and the US.A logo under it.

“You….little….. bit ch.” Alpha Rip dropped his head. I had fallen to the floor. Leaning back on my hands, he slowly moved his head over me to. There was more furry in his face than I have ever seen before.

Standing up, he tossed his head back and laughed. “What happened?” A warrior asked.

“Tell them.” He said as he waved his gun around.

“I contacted the military and they gave me a code to permanently disarm the bomb. It is useless. You can kill us but I will not help you kill my family.” I said with a smile on my face. If I was going to die, I wasn’t going to allow him to win. “They are on their way, might as well leave now.”

“We will be leaving but you will not. Starting with him.” Alpha Rip turned and pointed the gun at Jasper.

My wolf finally snapped as she transformed instantly. It was like I was watching everything in slow motion as the gun went off at the same time he pulled the trigger. As much as I wanted to see if Jasper was alive, Sierra was focused on Alpha Rip.

Tossing me to the side, he transformed into the biggest pure black. wolf I have ever seen. His eyes were so black, that you couldn’t even see them. Blending into his fur, he started circling me. Knowing I had to stay between Jasper and him, I held my ground. The warriors were all shifted too but stayed back. Most likely from his command.

Alpha Rip snapped at me. Sierra got her paw up and slapped his wolf. Barely nicking his nose. He was an Alpha but she was something

3:4

I happily sat back. The power that came from her was frightening and beautiful. Shaking out her fur, she let out a massive warning growl.








###Chapter 255
Alpha Rip didn’t take lightly to the threat and punched. Sierra met him in the air. Kicking him in the ribs, he got a slap across her face. Sierra managed to avoid his teeth as they fell to the ground. Not sure if Sierra was aware but the building was not built for werewolf fighting. The floor shook under the weight that was going placed on it.

Alpha Rip attacked again but Sierra was ready for it. Dodging his attack, he was able to dance around him. Wearing him out or making him that much more angry was going to be key to winning. However, keeping him from reaching Jasper was a chore. She didn’t have room to move. The room was small and Jasper stopped moving.

Alpha Rip made a move to get Jasper that Sierra blocked but it left her right side open. Alpha Rip instantly capitalized on it and sank his teeth into her hip. Her claws came back and swiped up. Leaving three large ga shes across his stomach. Still, he didn’t let go. Biting down harder, I felt them hit bone.

Using her weight, she fell over on top of him. He let go as our weight pushed against his lungs, and on the floor. A final cr ack made us sink in the floor. The carpet held strong. Making eye contact with Jasper, he shook his head no as Sierra used her claw and cut the carpet.

Instantly making them both fall through the floor. As her head passed, the door burst open and our warriors came in shooting their

guns.

Sierra landed on Alpha Rip, crushing her fall. Instantly jumping up, she was expecting him to come after her again. However, there was a single wooden shrapnel sticking out of his neck. Shaking, he transformed back into Alpha human form.

n’s

His eyes were black with anger as he tried to take the wood out.

Sierra took her paw and stepped on his hand. Breaking every bone as noveldrama

pooling quickly from under him: Not wanting to leave anything to chance, Sierra dug in his chest until she pulled out his heart.

The door to the room we were in burst open to see me holding Alpha Rip’s heard in my mouth. It was the military. They had arrived and looked alarmed but not scared.

“Identify yourself!” He said and pointed a gun at me.

“She is one of us!” I recognized Peter as he pushed his way through the humans. Setting his gun down, he pulled off his vest and then his shirt. Tossing it at my feet, he put his vest back on. “Turn around.” He instructed. They instantly listened and I was able to shift back into my human form.

Putting on his shirt, it barely reached my thighs. “Okay.” I said.

“We need to get you out of here.” Peter came over to me and grabbed my arm.

“Jasper!” I yelled and ripped my arm from him.

“Is being taken outside. Hurry.” Peter grabbed me again but this time I didn’t protest. Going down the hall, we were escorted down the stairs and out of the building.

“Get them to the extraction site. I’m going to check on my men.”

Peter said as we came up to two military men holding Jasper. Going down the street, we continued on a slow jog for almost a mile before they slowed down. I recognized Jacob running towards us.

“S hit.” He said as he looked at Jasper.

“Doctor! Jasper needs immediate medical attention!” Jacob said in a very authoritive way. The doctor instantly stopped doing what he was going and rushed over with some nurses.

quick examination, he looked at the nurse. “Call for a med-

vac.” The nurse nodded ran to a vehicle. I watched as she ripped open the door and got on the radio.

“What is it?” I asked looking back at the doctor.

“Broken bones but it’s the purpling. I’m worried he has some internal bleeding. Bullets are still in his ankle and knee. We need to get him into emergency surgery.” Jasper looked down at his b*dy and back up at me.

“You will be fine.” I said trying to stay strong.

The nurse came back with a gurney. Jacob and the doctor laid Jasper down as they rushed him under a tent. I was left standing there alone. Jasper had to be okay, there wasn’t another choice. The military men walked away, not saying a word.

It wasn’t until someone put a blanket around me that I snapped out of my trans and looked around. Peter had come back with another line of prisoners. “Do you need to sit or get a drink?” He asked.

“N-no.” I was trying to gather my thoughts and think rationally. “What is the report?” I asked as he started to turn away.

“Report?” Peter looked at me confused.

“Yes, what is the report?” I looked at him and waited..

“Luna… maybe you should…” Peter looked at me like I was crazy.

“Give me the f ucking report.” I said as I felt the anger build up in me.

Peter sighed but nodded. “Alpha Rip is obviously dead. Dar-”

“I know how Darin died, continue.” I interrupted. Peter gave me a double glance before his eyes shifted to my hand. He must have spotted all the red staining and connected the dots but thankfully didn’t ask.







###Chapter 256
“Everyone who surrendered are cuffed and being brought here for processing and will be placed in a cell. Alpha Colt or Alpha Alec will decide when they get here.”

The last part annoyed me but I let it go. “I assume Judd was killed.”

“Yes, Luna. He was found dead and is being transferred with everyone else that died.”

“No, pull his b*dy and place by himself. He was not a traitor.”

“Luna?” Peter looked at me confused.

“For the last time Peter, do as I ask or you will not like what happens next.” I was getting a headache and did not appreciate being

questioned.

“Yes, Luna.”

“Also, I want a man named Zac brought up to me.”

Peter looked taken aback by this. “Zac?”

“That is correct. If he is here, which I doubt but if he is, I want him brought to me.” I had a hunch.

“I don’t-”

“Asked around Peter, use your brain, figure it out!” I knew my wolf was coming to the surface by this point.

“Yes, Luna.” Peter bowed before walking over to the prisoners.

Three helicopters were racing as they rounded the tree-line. As they got closer, the wind picked up, blowing my hair around my face. The tent sides were whipping anyone who got close but it wasn’t until the

tubes down his throat and out of his arms. His chest had this

massive tube sticking out with blood dripping down to the dirt below. All three of the medical team was covered from the waist down with the sticky red stuff. There was enough blood that made me wonder if there was any left in Jasper’s b*dy.

As the three helicopters touched down, the medical team ran towards more medical personnel as they got out. Handing him off, the

helicopter with Jasper took off. I kept watching as more medical people got out but it was the two men that jumped out and starting running towards me that caused my front to start to crumble.

My legs weren’t moving. As much as I wanted to run to them, I was frozen. Colt hung back as Alec raced on, without breaking eye contact. The only time I finally moved was when Alec reached me and scooped me up. Wrapping myself around him, he hugged me tightly. My legs and arms wrapped around him, holding on with everything I had left in me. noveldrama

“I’m so sorry.” Alec declared in my ear. He pulled back enough to k*ss me hard before squeezing me tightly again.

“Don’t be. I told them to take me. I’m okay.” I felt a little hysterical feelings start to come up but it was too easy to push them down. That was no who I was and it was not who I wanted to be. Those

feelings would not win. I am stronger than that.

“Did he hurt you?” Alec set me down and pulled the blanket away. His eyes darkened when he realized I was wearing Peter’s shirt.

“I’m fine. My wolf has already been healing me. Nothing I haven’t dealt with before.”

“Kristen.” I heard Colt say. Looking over, he looked like he aged thirty

years.

gave

a hug. I could feel the

relief flow through him as he held me close.

“Why the f uck did you go with them?” Colt let me go and turned angry out of love.

“Because that is what a Luna does for her men. If the roles were

reversed, you would have went without hesitation to save Penny.” Pl Placing my hand on his face, his eyes closed as he nodded.

StStill, don’t do that again.” Colt said.

AlAlec grabbed my arm and forced me to look at him. “I’d rather die hethen watch that again. Do you hear me?”

LoLook at my boys thinking they can control me!” I smiled before giving ihim a little k*ss on the l*ps. “Come on, I have so much to tell you.”

GrGrabbing Alec’s hand, I went to walk to somewhere private but I heard mymy name get called out. “LUNA!”







###Chapter 257
We all turned and watched Peter walk up to us with someone in handcuffs. “What is this?” Alec asked, a little annoyed.

“Is this who you wanted?” Peter pushed him to his knees. Grabbing a fist full of hair, Peter grabbed a fist full of hair and ripped his head back.

“Mother f ucker!” Colt was pi ssed.

“Wait!” I said as I put my arm out to stop Colt. “Peter, let him go.” Peter looked at Alec for confirmation. I was f ucking done with not being listened to by Peter. Letting go of Alec, it only took me three steps to reach Peter and punch him right in the nose. Peter didn’t even move as he probably wasn’t even sure what I was going to do.

“Whoa! What is going on?” Alec stepped forward.

“Listen here, Peter. I am your f ucking Luna and you will do exactly as I say. Disrespect me one more time and I will not hesitate to put you in your place.” I knew my aura was out. The camp had gotten quiet as they watched the exchange. Peter was on his knees. Holding his nose, he looked up at me.

“Yes, Luna.”

“Great, get back to work.” Pulling back my aura, Peter got up and left without looking at Alec.

“Ice, what is going on?” Colt was looking between us.

“Zac, stand up and follow me.” Zac looked taken aback but listened. He stood up like I said and started walking behind me. Still cuffed, Colt walked beside him and Alec walked beside me.

No one spoke until we got to a separate tent that the set up as a

his arms crossed, he looked at me, confused.

“Zac, do you know who I am?” I asked, firmly but politely.

“I do.”

“Do you know they are?” I asked glancing at Alec and Colt.

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Colt, this is Penny’s father, Zac.” I said without looking at Colt. Zac looked taken aback but didn’t say anything.

“What?” Colt kept his composure but got a closer look at Zac. His beard had grown out and his hair looked like he hadn’t brushed it in months. With it being down to his shoulders, his identity was hidden.

“Zac is not the traitor you think he was, nor was Judd.” I said as I took

a seat.

“Judd never betrayed anyone!” Zac looked angry. noveldrama

“I know. Judd was placed undercover by Marc. However, these two formed an agreement based on a similar objective. You see, Alpha Rip has a mate that is very much alive. Before she found Rip, she had a boyfriend.” I didn’t take my eyes off Zac, making sure what I was told was the truth.

Zac avoided eye contact with me. “She-she is still alive?”

“She is.”

“Who is she?” Colt asked.

“Cassie was her name. Daughter of Alpha Ivan, the only child of Ivan and Penny’s mother.” I said. Both Alec and Colt’s eyes widened in shock.

“WHAT?” Colt yelled before he composed himself.

Rip found Cassie, she was already pregnant. She tried to pass the baby off as Rip’s but she looked too much like her dad. Rip found

out the truth so they got the baby out of there. Zac has been working these last 19 years under cover at Rip’s pack in order to protect Penny from attack.”

“I’m so confused.” Alec was trying to piece it together.

“Alpha Rip wanted Darin to take over the pack when he died. However, werewolf law requires the first born is the Alpha. Penny is older than Darin. Therefore, Penny is the heir to the title. Not Darin. Darin only becomes alpha if Penny died. However, Rip knew that Judd was a spry because he downloaded an app on his phone that made all communication Judd had sent to his phone. Rip read every single text message Judd sent to Marc. They is why he moved away from the garage. He was pre-warned. Rip’s goal was to kill everyone and take over all three packs.”

“He built the tunnels to attack our pack and set up a missile to level everything.”






###Chapter 258
“Yeah, we gave him a way out when we moved our pack to Colt’s

pack. He was going to just kill everyone instead of just you two and

me.”

“Alpha Rip and Darin are dead.” Alec said trying to wrap his head. around this.

“That makes…” Colt continued.

“Cassie is now Alpha of Midnight River pack.” I finished for them both. “Penny is the heir to the title. She is currently in the cells.”

“Did he mark her?” Alec asked.

“I’m afraid so. She didn’t mark him but the bond was already there. I’m afraid with the conditions she has been in, she may not survive this.”

“Take me to her. I’ll mark her and keep her wolf there. I never stopped loving her.” Zac looked desperately up at Colt. “Please! Let me put my family back together!”

Colt was speechless. He wasn’t sure what to say but kept looking at Alec and me before looking back at Zac. “For Penny’s sake…” I looked at Colt. He met my eyes and I didn’t need to say anything else.

After a moment, he said, “Okay.”

Zac was on his feet quicker than I expected. Alec grabbed me and held me close to him as Colt grabbed a hold of Zac. Together, we walked back to the helicopter. Alec and I sat on one side and Colt and Zac sat on the other. I still had the blanket around me but as I sat down, it shifted a little.

“Are you okay?” Zac asked, bringing my attention to him. The

making Colt and Alec to do the same.

“Nothing important.” I said as I tired to cover it up. However, Colt was faster than I was.

“What the f uck happened?” His eyes were black. “Those are claw marks.”

“I ripped out Darin’s heart, I’m fine.” Grabbing the blanket, I moved to cover myself up. Colt was not happy with that statement and neither was Alec but he just pulled me closer to him and rested his chin on my head.

The rest of the ride was silent. No one spoke a word. Zac was bouncing in his seat. Colt was lost in his own world and Alec was worried. He kept checking his phone. For some reason, I wasn’t. I knew Jasper would pull through. He would be fine. He had to be. There wasn’t another option. Jasper had a baby on the way. He would be fine.

The helicopter jolted as it started to descend. Looking out of the window, there was some guards but mostly just pack members. No one looked scared but extremely nervous. What surprised me the most was how all the women were wearing rags and covered in dirt. Only the men were clean. Sherry’s words flashed in my head. Women were good for one thing.

Colt opened the door and walked out. He held his head high as he looked around. Spotting a guard, he walked up to him. “Get Cassie and bring her to me.” I got out first before Alec and Zac got out. The helicopter started quieting down, which helped.

“I don’t answer to you.” He said, squaring up.

“How about me? I ripped Darin’s heart out with my bare hands. Should we forced you to listen or are you going go into the cells and

my up w UVIL

The warrior’s eyes narrowed as I spoke. I knew this would challenge him. All the women cowered in fear. “Know your place!” He raised a hand but it was Colt that delivered a punch so hard that he fell over backwards.

“Can you please get Cassie from her cell?” I asked one of the woman. standing around. Colt grabbed the keys and handed them to me.

“Y-yes, ma’am.” She nodded and stayed bowed over as she turned from me.

###Chapter 259
I couldn’t help but look at the state of the poor woman that was leading me to Cassie. The rags she was wearing were literally only covering the important parts. Scars and bruises covered her exposed skinl. What should have been lushish brown hair was dull and

breaking. Dark circles lined her eyes and a freshly split l*ps finished off her look.

The cells were only a couple hundred yards away. I could see still Alec and Colt as she raised a door from the earth. The stairs were steep but manageable. I knew we were in the right place as the smell of sweat and blood filled my nose. It was so thick that my eyes started to water. We continued down a narrow tunnel until she finally stopped. Unlocking the door, she stepped back and bowed her head.

It was my turn to look. Sitting on the floor, with a metal dog collar around her neck, it was chained to the wall. Her hair was covered in dried blood and dirt, no a single article of clothings on was but a smile was across her face.

“Cassie?” I asked, softly.

“He’s dead.” She whispered quietly. Her voice was strained but there was a happiness to it.

“He is.” Taking the keys, I walked up to Cassie. “I am going to unlock you.”

“Wish I could have done it myself.” Her eyes opened and looked at

me.

“You realize what this means?” Her skin had started to grown around the collar, making me have to pull it from her literal flesh.,

“I do but my wolf doesn’t have much left.” Taking the blanket off me, I

“Zac is outside.” I said as I helped her stand. He must have been

keeping her wolf from her all these years. None of her injuries were healing good. One even looked infected.

“Zac?” Her eyes widened as she glanced at me.

“Yes. He has been trying to protect Penny all these years.” We walked slowly down the hall and up the stairs.

“Zac…” Cassie whispered as she was finally able to breath some fresh air after 19 years.

Alec held Zac back as we slowly made our way up to them. It took us awhile to get there since she was inching it. I suspected she hasn’t walked around the entire time she was in there. Maybe from one side to the other but nothing that would come close to this.

However, she collapsed just fifty yards from Zac. Colt managed to get the cuffs off Zac before he ran forward and pulled Cassie into his lap. “CAS SIE!”

“Zac! I can’t believe it’s you.”

“Let me mark you. Let me save you. If not for me but for Penny.” Zac had tears in his eyes as he carefully caressed her face.

Cassie closed her eyes but nodded. Her time was out and if Zac didn’t do it now, she would die. “Hurry up.”I said to Zac.

He didn’t need being told twice, pulling her tiny frame up, he bit down. into her collar bone. Cassie didn’t cry out or even move. Just a single tear ran down her face until he pulled out and licked it clean. Cassie’s head rolled to the side.

“What happened?” Zac asked.

“Follow me!” The same woman said as she ran off. Colt followed Zac and Cassie.

“Get everyone in this pack to gather in front of the packhouse.” Alec told the warrior. He didn’t want to listen but did it regardless. “Woman and children.” Alec clarified since we both could see if only

requesting the men.

“Lead us there.” I demanded. He didn’t even acknowledge my statement but turned around and started walking. Alec held my hand as we walked. Thankfully, it wasn’t far and people were already gathering around. There was far more woman and children than I expected but I wasn’t surprised about the number of men. Most of them were taken down already.







###Chapter 260
“As you all know, Alpha Rip and Darin are both dead. What you may not know, Alpha Ivan had a daughter before he died, Cassie. Cassie was Alpha Rip’s mate and is still very much alive. Fighting for her life in the hospital but is alive. Cassie has a daughter as well that is the heir to the throne. If Cassie does not make it, her daughter will be Alpha. There is many changes that are going to be happening immediately.” Alec said with as much authority as he could find.

“All women and children will need to make their way to Alpha Brian’s pack. The Blue Fang Pack is where Cassie’s child is currently the Luna. Luna Penny is a sweet and gentle soul that will see that bathed, clothed and get medical treatment.”

“All men will follow me to my pack where you will be treated accordingly.” Alec got on his phone and took a few steps back.

“Is this really happening?” A little girl came up to me. “Mommy won’t bleed anymore?” She looked to be around six or seven.

“No, sweety. Mommy will never bleed again.” My heart literally broke

as she said this.

“Vans will be here in twenty minutes.” Alec came back and

announced.

“I’m going to go with them.” I said in the mind-link. “I need to tell Penny the truth.”

“Good. You need to get cleaned up. Are you sure you are okay?”

“I am. I’ll take care of the women and children, you handle the men.”

“I am. There will be warriors that are coming that will assist Colt and 1.” Alec kept standing as everyone else sat down on the ground. The

Thankfully, multiple vans pulled into the driveway right as one of the warriors stood up. “I suggest you sit the f uck back down before I help you.” Alec must have noticed it too but he didn’t give them an inch.

Fortunately, many warriors all got out of the vehicles. Some of them were still wearing their battle uniform and others weren’t. “All women and children, please get into the vehicles.” I said as I helped a few stand.

“St upid b itch.” I heard a warrior whisper. My b*dy froze as I turned and got down on his level.

“Want to say that louder?” I asked, without breaking eye contact. I could see Colt walking up in the distance.

“I said… S tupid b itch!” He gave me so much attitude that I almost lost my balance.

“That’s what I thought. You see my hand? See all the red? This blood is from Darin. I ripped his heart out.” I made a show of extending my claws. Without pushing too deep, I cut a thin line right across his throat. noveldrama

“Disrespect me again, I’ll make sure that goes deeper. Time are

changing and you will either adjust your attitude or you can sleep with your dead Alpha. You can let my mate know what you decide and he will be happy with helping you achieve that, or you can ask my brother.” The warrior didn’t lose his attitude but did look a little more concerned.

“Luna Kristen. We need to go.”

That voice made me smile. “Clint.” Standing up, I turned and looked at

###Chapter 261
“Me too.”

“I can finally open my tattoo shop back up, go eat at the pizza parlor and even open our club back up!” The realization that my life was going to go back to normal was a huge relief. This was really the end. No more looking over my shoulder. No more sitting around the pack house. I can workout again. Finally take the school test that I have now missed twice. I can finally talk to Alec about having a baby…. or in a few years.

“We are here.” Clint said, pulling my out of my thoughts. As we pulled up to the packhouse, there was so many women standing around from both packs. Penny and Emmy were standing there, waving like idiots at me.

The van wasn’t even stopped when Penny ran forward and opened my door. “KRIS!” pulling me into a hug, she held me tightly.

“I can’t breathe!” I joked but she did let me go.

“I am so glad you are okay!” Emmy came up to me. Surprisingly, no tears in her eyes but her belly was getting big.

“I am!” Emmy hugged me too.

“Welcome! I am Luna Penny. These women here are going to help you shower, get some clothes and food! Please follow them. If you need anything, please let them know and we will get it for you!” Penny was a natural leader.

“Can we talk privately?” I asked Penny and Emmy.

“Of course.” Penny smiled at me but took Emmy’s hand and helped her up the stairs.

redecorated. The only thing the same was the floor and even there was a massive rug. New pictures hung on the wall, new statues boarded the door and even a fresh coat of paint. This wasn’t the packhouse full of horrors.

“Like it?” Penny asked.

I was left speechless. Emmy came up to me and put her hands on my shoulders. “She wanted to erase all the bad memories and replace them with good ones.”

“T-thank you.” I had to collect myself.

“Can you come visit here now?” Penny asked.

“Yes, I would love to come visit here now.” Emmy smiled and took my hand as we made our way to Colt and Penny’s office.

“It was more important to redo to foyer. This office will be next.” Penny said as she took her seat. Emmy sat in an arm chair, leaving me the other.

“Penny…” I started. Sitting up straight, I didn’t know how to say it.” Actually, Emmy, have you heard from Jasper?”

“I did actually. He was out of surgery right before you arrive. He was awake and doing great. They are transferring him here and should be here within the hour.”

“Good.”

“I can’t thank you enough for saving him.” Emmy reached out and grabbed my hand.

“Of course. I’ll never leave a man behind.”

“The doctor said that if he had taken one more ball to his stomach, he noveldrama

would have died. You really did save his life,”

put my hand on her stomach. She wasn’t huge but you could tell she was pregnant and not just bloated now.

“What is it you need to tell me?” Penny asked after a moment.

“I know who your parents are.” I said after taking a deep breath and looking at her in the eyes.

The shock and surprise was clear. “What?”

“We haven’t found anything.” Emmy said, equally shocked:

“I can spare you the story if you don’t want it and just tell you where they are at.” I was giving her an out.

“They have not betrayed you but protected you, your entire life. They are good people that were forced to do bad things.”

The room was quiet for awhile as Penny struggled to find out what she wanted. End the end, she looked at me and nodded. “Yes, I want to know but keep the details out. Just an overview.”

Mrs. Smith Author

I can’t thank you all enough for all the love and support you have shown me. I was able to get my rating of 9.9 stars out of 10 I am beyond blessed to have been able to share this story with you all. Depending on how tomorrow goes (my nephew turned 5 and we are having a party for him) I might update tomorrow. Regardless, I will be posting two chapters a day till the book is finished by the end of the month. Thank you all again!







###Chapter 262
Penny didn’t have the same stomach as I did. “Okay. Alpha Ivan was the Alpha of Midnight River pack. He had one daughter, named Cassie. Cassie had a boyfriend, Zac, that got her pregnant. She was just a few weeks along when she met Alpha Rip, her mate. Knowing his personality, she tried to pass off the pregnancy as his. However, the baby came out looking just like her dad. Alpha Rip said he was going to kill the baby so Cassie and Zac got the baby out and left her outside of Blue Fang Pack. Cassie was…. either way, together Cassie and Rip had Darin. Rip has spend the last 19 years plotting to kill everyone so Darin would get the Alpha position and not Cassie’s daughter. However, Rip and Darin are dead. Cassie was marked by Zac a little bit ago and is in the hospital. She is currently the Alpha of Midnight River pack.”

The room was silent for a long time while both girls digested this information. “Why was he trying to kidnap you?” Emmy said after a little bit.

“Well, it get fuzzy but they had one plan and it kept changing and Darin really did have a fantasy about us and hired the rogues. However, he asked Zac to get the rogues so Zac got s hitty he knew we would beat.”

As

“You almost died…” Emmy looked at me like I was losing my min and Alec. F u ck, Ace died!”

“True but he had to sell it. The way I see it, Zac would have blown his cover if he would have been successful. I think by shooting Alec in the arm, it was his way to making it look real without breaking his cover.”

“Cassie can’t be an Alpha when she has spent the last 19 years in a cell.” Emmy said.

title to Penny. It would be the right thing. She isn’t physically or m entally able to do it.” We never discussed it but I had a hunch.

“What does that mean?” Penny asked.

“It mean, you will be the alpha of Midnight River pack and Colt is the alpha of Blue Fang. However, I would suggest merging the packs and just expanding Blue Fang.”

“That is massive.” Emmy’s eyes got wide.

“I think it is something you and Colt will need to decide what is best for you guys. Alec and I will always be here for support.”

“So… Cassie and Zac are my….my parents?” Penny asked, hesitantly.

“They are. I think it is best that you give it a day or two before your meet them. Talk to Colt about how to go about it but I’d give it a day or two.” I didn’t want her to see the state of her mother’s neck.

Penny opened her mouth but closed it and nodded. She must have. read between the lines and decided it wasn’t worth going against my word. I would never steer her in the wrong direction so I was thankful she agreed to that. Still, not knowing who your parents are all these years and then all that get dumped on you?

“What are Colt and Alec doing?” Emmy asked.

“Seeing to the warriors of Midnight River pack and making some adjustments to them. We can obviously discuss how to move.

forward with them but I believe it will be in everyone best interest to completely flatten that pack and build new homes. Those women are

traumatized.” noveldrama

“Sherry has opened up a little to me about what had happened to her.” Penny looked sick. “I would agree with that statement.”

“I want to shower and change my clothes and then I want to go down. to the kitchen and eat everything in sight.”

“Nothing was ever done to your room.” Penny said looking at me.

“What?”

“Colt refused to allow it. I cleaned it and what not but Colt wanted it to be there. He knew there would be a time when you would want to come back and he wanted you to feel like this will always be a home. to you: So, we compromised. I wanted that too, obviously, but I knew you wouldn’t ever think of this as your home again. You checked out the moment you marked Alec. We decided to remodel the entire place. However, that room is untouched. It is your’s to remodel or

leave as is. I don’t think you will ever feel like this is home to you but hopefully it will be a place you will want to visit. A place you can get memories with any niece or nephew you have.”







###Chapter 263
I was quiet for a moment. As much as I appreciated and respected what my brother wanted and hoped. I agreed with Penny. This will. never be my home but I did find myself willing to come back here for any of their kids. “Nursery.”

“What?” Penny seemed confused.

“Make my old room a nursery for your future kids. You are right. I’l never see this as my home. I will probably never stay here again but ! want to see it filled with all the happy memories I never had. I know you will live at the house but while you do work here, make that room the nursery or even just a play room. I’ll come back and visit, especially when those kids get popping out but I don’t want the room. Put mom’s old furniture in there. She wanted it to be loved on and you wanted to redecorate the house.”

“Then that is what I’ll do.” Penny smiled at me.

“Come on. I’ll take you to my room that I’ve been staying in for you to shower. I have clothes you can wear as well.” Emmy stood up and nudged me.

“Perfect. Thank you.” Smiling at Emmy, I stood up but stopped and looked at Penny. “Are you okay? Do you want to come and sit with us while I shower?”

“No. I’m not sure I am okay but I will be. I just need to process this. I am going to go check on the women and food.” Penny sighed before standing up herself.

“Okay, we will see you down there.” Emmy said. We went one way and Penny went the other. It wasn’t until we were in her room that either

one of us spoke again. “Do you think she will be okay?”

“Eventually. She probably dreamed of finding her parents and then to find out what happened to them…” I gave Emmy a look as I got in the shower.

“Jasper is landing…” Emmy looked at her phone.

“Go! I know how to shower myself.” Smiling at her, she didn’t need being told twice. Running out of the door, she was gone before I even turned around.

Truthfully, I was a little thankful. I wanted to quiet time to myself. Just to process what happened. Everything has happened so quickly that I haven’t processed it myself. I haven’t even found a normal since. Alec and I mated. Everything snowballed so fast that I don’t even remember what day it was. However, I didn’t feel trapped. There wasn’t any lingering emotions of anxiety or any type of PTSD. I felt at piece. That might have to do with the fact that I quite literally ripped his heart of out of his chest. It could be the fact that I knew they were dead. I watched them die and they wouldn’t be around to hurt me. noveldrama

anymore.

After my shower, I was able to use Emmy’s blow dryer and

straightener. Thankfully, I also found some bras that would fit me and underwear with the tag still on them. Grabbing just basic shorts and t- shirt, I felt more myself. For the first time, in a long time, I was excited to go out and talk to people.

The entire atmosphere was different. Kids were laughing as they ran around. Mothers were chasing them, scolding them or just laughing at them. Everyone had a drink in their hand and just seemed to be chilling.

“Hey, Luna Kris! Do you need anything to drink? We are passing out coffee, chi tea or waters. We have lemonade for the kids. I can get. you something different if you prefer.” One of my old pack members, Suzie, was walking around with a couple empty glasses.

“No, thank you. How is everything going? Do you need any help?”

“Obviously we are busy but it’s been great. Everyone is helping

everyone so its been pretty relaxed. I do think Luna Penny might need help in the kitchen.” Suzie whispered the last part to me.







###Chapter 264
Chapter 0264 “Okay. I’ll go check it out.” I said, smiling at her. She nodded and kept on going around asking if anyone needed drinks. I had to dodge a few kids before I made it to the kitchen. “…nightmare!” I caught the last part of it. “What’s wrong?” I asked as I shut the door behind me. “I don’t think we have enough food for everyone!” Penny looked like she was in tears. “Okay. What do you have?” “We have deli meat, some pastas, salads, fruits but I don’t feel like it is enough.” I could hear the concern on her voice. “Well, remember those women were starved. They aren’t going to eat a lot. Second, there are boxes of mac n cheese on the counter over there. Make that for the kids.” I started looking through the fridge. You have plenty of cheese and tortillas, maybe some people will want a quesadilla. There are some leftover shredded chicken and steak in here. Plus, I’ll call Alec and see where they are at. If he is getting ready to head over, I’ll have him bring some stuff from our house. Okay?” “Thank you!” Penny looked relieved. The kitchen staff got to work as I took her phone and walked out to the porch. It rang three times before he answered. “Alpha Alec.” “Hey, it’s me.” “Kristen? What number are you calling me from?” “Penny’s. I have no idea where my phone is.” “It’s a gift, really.” “So, what’s going on?” He went back to being serious.

“How soon are you guys coming over?” “Why? Are you okay?” “Oh, I’m fine. Happy, really but Penny is freaking out she doesn’t have enough food.” “Ah, well we were about to head over in a few minutes. I was actually getting ready to shower.”

“Great. Can you bring over all the deli meat we have and anything that can be served easily?” I asked, happy that he wouldn’t be much longer. “Sure. Have you heard anything on Jasper?” “Yeah. Surgery went good. They brought him over here and Emmy is with him now. I think he will be just fine.” “Good.” I heard the shower turn on. “Hurry over.” I sighed as I sat on the porch swing. “I will, love. I will.” There will always be this warm fuzzy feeling when he called me love. “Bye.” I said “Bye.” Alec hung up and I just rocked back and forth. “Did you get ahold of him?” Penny said, scaring the life out of me. “S HIT!” I jumped as she sat down. “HA! Sorry!” Penny started laughing at me. “You scared the s hit out of me. Yes, he will be here in about thirty minutes.” Giving her a little push, she settled down next to me. “I really am glad you are okay.” “I’m pretty stubborn that way.” I didn’t want to have a heart felt conversation at this moment. “I should thank you, though.” Penny started laughing a little. “What? Why?” I was confused. “You got us out of the school testing again. I have been dreading that.” I couldn’t contain my laughter. “Seriously?” “Colt has been stressing about that da mn test and everything else.” “Why is he stressed over a test? He doesn’t actually need to take it. None of us do.” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you for reading!! 07

men gasped in horror as another guy stepped forward and he stepped back. “We accept full responsibility for failing to protect our Alpha and Lunas. Luna Erin was found dead, from the loss of her mate.” I these guys wore a bruise on their face. At first, I thought it was from the battle but now I think differently. Colt and his warriors stood off to the side. “We accept full responsibility for our actions and will accept any punishment you deem fit. We are deeply sorry. Your bravery not only killed Darin and Rip but save multiple people from a terrible fate.” A third warrior said. Falling back in line, everyone was quiet. Not even the children were making a sound. Alec looked up at me. “I can decide their punishment if you prefer.” He said in the mind-link. Taking a deep breath, I walked down the steps and into Alec’s arms. “Everyone will be punished…” I started. A few of them blinked, waiting for what that punishment was. After a pause, I kept going. “… but not tonight. Right now I was to celebrate our victory. I want everyone to come together as one. So many lives were lost yet so many people got new ones. Tonight we will eat and hold our loved ones. Tomorrow we will find a new normal. There will be a lot of changes coming. Actions speak louder than words and we are watching.” “Dismissed.” Alec shouted before turned and looking at me. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there to get you.” “It’s okay. I got myself out of there. Reaching up, I grabbed his shirt and pulled on it. Alec got the hint and bent down to k*ss me. His hands grabbed my face and gentle touched my split l*p. “You are the strongest person I know.” Alec sighed. “I’m sorry about your mother.” I whispered. “I felt the bond snap when we were on our way to get you.” Alec closed his eyes for a second. “How did you know where to find me?” Beckham broke through the firewall just after you were taken. It worked perfectly and there was two numbers that came up the most. Time was not on our side so we separated into two teams.” Wrapping my arms around his neck, his wrapped around my waist. “I don’t regret my decision.” “I know you don’t.” Alec frowned at me. “You are both irritating and brave.”noveldrama







###Chapter 265
“He wants to hang his diploma on the wall. To show kids that school is important. Colt wants to enroll in College classes this fall in business.” Penny whispered it like it was a big secret.

“Oh really?” That shocked me.

“Yup. Wants to be a good role model.”

“That’s good.” I was actually kind of impressed. I had no desire to continue on with any education. Part of thought I might but I am more excited to get back to my shop. Get back to relaxing. We sat in silence for awhile until I stood up.

As if right on cue, multiple vehicles came down the driveway. My heart started jumping for joy. Women started running out of the packhouse to greet their mates. Screaming with their own joy as they jumped on them. Half of the men were clean after a shower and the other half were dirty still.

“MEN!” Alec yelled in a very loud, pis sed off tone. Anyone was that holding their mates, put them down and formed a line. All the women. backed up, confused on what was happening. I was even confused, so I got up and walked to the top of the stairs. Alec walked around to the front with his arms crossed.

One guy stepped forward. In a very military fashion, started speaking. “Luna Kristen. Due to our inattentiveness, we were able to be captured. Resulting in Alpha Marc and Henry being killed. It resulted in you having to allow yourself to be kidnapped once again to save us from the same fate.” Many of the woChapter 0269

People were coming and going in different directions. Piles of furniture, clothes, blankets and pretty much everything was being tossed out. I saw can of gas off to the side with a torch and knew exactly what they had in mind. I wasn’t against this. What surprised me was Jasper sitting on the step.

“What are you doing?” I yelled as I got out of my car. Alec was even

confused.

“I wasn’t about to spend another day in that place. A man needs fresh air.” Jasper tried to stand up Emmy kept him firmly in place.

“Don’t get up. You should be in bed.”

“I have my wolf and am healing good. I’m just going to sit here and watch everyone else work.” Jasper laughed but bent over in pain.

“I’m going to be dragging your as s back to the hosptial if you don’t start relaxing!” Emmy was scolding him as passing women were trying to hide their laughter. Alec and I went up the stairs and into the depressing house.

The entire place was spotless but yet looks like it was something out of a horror movie. Stained glass windows of wolves were actually quite pretty in a horrifying way. Part of me didn’t want them to get destroyed but I didn’t want any remembrance of this place. However it would be the ultimate f uck you to keep them and put them in a women’s shelter or something like that.

“What are you doing?” Alec asked. I didn’t realize I had stopped walking.

“Those stained glass windows. They are beautiful in a way. I was trying to decide if I wanted to keep them and use them to design

“That isn’t your worst idea.” Alec grabbed my hand and pulled me

down the hall. The office door was open and we could hear Penny talking to Colt.

“…complete mess! For a man that wanted woman to keep things clean, he was a pig!”

“I see things are going smoothly here.” I didn’t even try to hide my smile as we walked in.

“This is all yours!” Penny had hair sticking out in every direction.

“The big bad Penny has a situation you can’t handle?” I teased. noveldrama

She put her hands on her hips and glared at me. Something she has never done. “You already had it organized by the time you gave it to me. This is just….” She waved her hand around like a crazy person.

“How about I will work on this, I believe I heard the kitchen needed helped deciding what to keep and what food to throw away.” I was giving her an out.

“You know what!” She was a little hysterical at this point. “I’ll just do that!” She stomped out and it was all I could do to look at Colt.

“She is a little overwhelmed right now.” He looked like he was exhausted just from listening to her.

“However, we do need your help.”

“I got it. You just move over.” I said as I pushed his chair out of my

way.

“Thank, sis.” Colt stood up and walked over to Alec.

“Why don’t you guys figure out who is going where and move on t the warriors. This might take me awhile. Send Emmy in here whe she if she is done yelling at Jasper.”

“All the women are yelling.” Colt sighed.

“I haven’t yelled yet!” I acted offended.

“Yet being the key word.” Alec muttered. I was looking down and

made a show up slowly moving my eyes up. Colt laughed as he

darted out of the room and Alec just smirked but came over to give me a k*ss.

“Get your as s out of here.” I faked grumbled as I started shifting through the paper files.

I found everything. The paper trail of his attack on our packs. How he planed on flattening it and what he wanted to do with the land. There was an entire files on the different businesses he owned and what they did. Most of these will fall back in the hands of the banks and will be up to them to sell or discontinue the business. What I wouldn’t give to have all this information last week.







###Chapter 266
“It’s really a gift.” I laughed.

“Kris? Alec? We can’t eat without you guys.” Penny popped her head out from the packhouse door.

“Coming.” I yelled as Alec let me go and was walked hand in hand. Everyone was seated at a table and a beautiful array of food was lined against the far wall. As we took our seat, Alec stayed standing.

“A few quick announcements before we begin. Firstly, from my pack. is welcome to return to your houses. Everyone from Midnight River pack will stay here for tonight and tomorrow there will be direction on what moving forward will look like. There is much sensitive information that needs to get sorted before any announcement is made. I would like to thank everyone from the Blue Fang pack for their hospitality and kindness that has been shown these last few days.” The entire room erupted in clapping. Penny was blushing and Colt just raised his hand but was smiling.

Alec sat down and Penny stood up. “Each table was given a number. That is the order in which you came go up and get food.”

Seeing that we were table one, we all got up and made our way through the line. When we were half way done, the next table went. Everyone was acting respectful to everyone and talking quietly. I knew everyone was talking at our table but I was just looking at everyone. Our parents were gone and now it was literally up to us to keep them safe and alive.

“Ice?” There was a push against my arm, pulling my attention back to the group.

“What?” I looked over at Colt, Penny, Emmy, Jacob, Sherry and Alec all looking at me.

“Where did you go?” Colt asked.

“The threat is gone. I can open my shop again. We can open the club again. People can go shopping and go back to being happy. We are in charge of everyone now. I’m safe. Everyone is safe.” I’ve repeated that in my head multiple times today but this was the first time I said it out loud.

Alec put his arm around me and pulled me close to him. Kissing my temple, he scooted us together so I was against him. “That’s right. I believe your shop is ready to go. Do you want to have a grand opening?” Penny asked excitedly.

“I suppose so. I need to find my books of who needs to get back on the schedule. Assuming they haven’t got them fixed already.”

“Awesome. Please let me organize it!” Penny asked, her face lit up and there was no denying it.

“Ppple eee as see?”

“Sure. Don’t go crazy!” I said quickly.

“Of course not!” Penny had a devilish look to her eyes. Colt shook his

head but smiled at her.

“Are you going to Florida?” Colt asked.

“Yeah, maybe next week. We need to figure out who is going where and what is happening. Though, that is really your problem, not ours.”

“Actually, it is your problem too.” Colt said and sat back in his chai

“Oh? We are doing this here?” Penny dropped her fork and looked a

Colt.

“What are you talking about?” Alec asked.

“I had Calvin draw this up for me like an hour ago. It’s rough but thi

to me. It was of the entire area. However, instead of three packs, it was divided directly in half. The whole thing was a large circle with. the town in the middle. Colt and Penny would own half of it and Alec and I would have the other half.

“What?” I was shocked. noveldrama

“The area is much too big for just us. Dividing it would be beneficial and after all the turmoil, we think it is best to eliminate the Midnight River Pack name.” Colt said with zero emotion.

“You were key in taking down Rip and Darin. If it wasn’t for you, we may not be here right now.” Penny said softly.

“I did what any luna would do. You would be surprised what you can do when there is a gun to your mate’s head and your warriors.” I said in autopilot.







###Chapter 267
Chapter 0267 “Still, this is our proposal. We will give each person a choice on who they want to serve under. They can decide if they want Colt or Alec ast an alpha and we will each build our own territory up.” Colt said as he grabbed his drink and took a sip. I was at a loss for words. “Are you sure?” Alec leaned forward and took the paper to examine it future. “I do.” Colt said simply. “Come by tomorrow and we can finalize plans.” Colt stood up and Penny followed. “It’s early but we are going to turn in and have a quiet evening in our rooms.” Penny said. “I would like to get back to Jasper anyway.” Emmy stood up. “Let me know if you need anything.” I said to her. “Of course!” We watched Emmy make her way out of the kitchen and out the door.

“Attention everyone! Luna Penny and I are going to enjoy a quiet evening. Please follow the regular guidelines in place for quiet hours. when that comes around. Everyone has received their assigned rooms. If there are any questions or concerns, there are staff members around the pack house to help. They can mind-link us if need. We will always be available to help where needed. There will be a shuttle service to those who wish to head back to Black Moon Pack.” Everyone nodded before going back to their conversations. “I would like to head home too.” I said to Alec. “Here, you can take my car. Bring it back tomorrow.” Colt tossed Ale some keys. You can stay YOU “No. I want to go to my home.” I said. “Maybe one day I will stay the night but that isn’t tonight.” Jacob frowned but nodded. “Thank you.” Sherry, who hasn’t spoke all evening, finally said something. “For what?” I was genuinely confused. “For killing them.” There wasn’t any emotion in her face as she said. the words. Jacob wrapped his armnoveldrama

around her as she buried her face in his chest. He gave us a look that said it was her way of healing. “I hope you find some peace.” I said to her as Alec and I followed Colt and Penny out of the kitchen. Multiple people stopped us today express their gratitude but I was ready to get home. We didn’t speak as Alec unlocked the car and opened my door. Sliding in, he went around to the driver’s side and got in. As soon as he was out of the driveway, he put his arm on my thigh. Not sure why, but I pulled my legs up against my chest and held onto his arm. Resting my head and closing my eyes. “Love, we’re home.” Alec had to shake me to get me to wake up. it felt like we just left. “Okay.” Letting go of him, I got out of the vehicle. I expected him to hold my hand as we walked inside, however, he came over and grabbed my thighs. Somewhat caught off guard, my arms went around his neck as my ankles locked behind him. “That’s better.” He grumbled as he carried me inside. His tongue was remembering just how I liked it. Going down my neck, he left little nibbles. I was so lost in how good it felt that I didn’t even realize we had made it to our room until he slammed the door shut and locker it. No one was even here but it might have been out of habit or just in “I’m sorry, this won’t be gentle or slow. I’ll make it up to you.” Alect tossed me down on the bed. He was standing over me, just looking at me. “Good.” I said. Sitting up, I pulled on his draw string and let his shorts. fall. Mrs. Smith Author Thope everyone had a great weekend!







###Chapter 268
Chapter 0268 To say I was sore would be an understatement. Alec lived up to his word when he said he wasn’t going to be gentle. Not that I minded. Reconnecting physically was something that I needed. He was mine. and I was his. The only man I would let touch me. We had just finished getting ready and were about head out. There was so much to discuss but yet, so little. After Colt dropped that bomb on us, the possibilities were huge. We needed to go through the Midnight River packhouse and get rid of any sensitive information. Colt wanted to meet us there and allow all the women to get whatever they wanted from their houses. They could either request to stay there or abandon it completely. All of us would understand either way. If they had a mate, it was required they would live in the packhouse or until they can show how to properly treat a mate. At the end of the day, it was up to the woman to stay with them or reject them. All would be required to undergo some therapy to make sure they weren’t being coerced. I had a feeling most, if not all, the women would request new housing. In addition, all women and men would be allow to choose which pack they wish to join or even have the opportunity to ask to join another pack. There are some packs across the U.S.A that had the same reputation as Alpha Rip. Part of me feared they would leave and find them, taking their mates and children with them. At the end of the day, I knew it wasn’t something I could fully intervene with and it wa up to the women to decide. Everyone has been notified of these options and when we arrive a the Midnight River Pack, we should have a good idea who is goin where, or at least by the end of the day. “What did you do to the warriors?” I asked as we walked to the ca

AICU NUJ yviny our car. him unui ma yuny i uru “They each fought me and did a few different drills.” Alec sighed. “What about the Midnight warriors?”

“They were punished with the whip and will be brought out with cuffs. to either plead their case or be killed. Their choice.” Alec didn’t seemed fazed by this. “Where are they now?” I asked in the mind-link since we just pulled out of the garage and headed to meet Colt. “Our warriors came and got them this morning and walked them over. They are already at the pack and chained to poles.” “This will be a long day.” I sighed. “I hate this part of the job.” “Me too, love. Me too.” “So, you settled on that pet name for me?” “Seems like a life time ago we were having that conversation.” Alec chuckled. “I know. I’m hoping I can talk Colt into opening the club tonight.” “I think he would be on board with it.” I felt a little excitement coming from Alec. “Is the construction of the event center finished?” I asked. “Actually, it is. Finished last week. I have already secured them for a housing division.” “When did you do that?” I asked, completely surprised. “The other day. I got an email from them and we needed more housing anyway so it worked out.” “It’s nice when things workout.” I said as we slowed down. “I don’t think I have ever been here.” The boarder was completely brick and about eight feet tall. Wrought iron metal doors were standing open for us with pretty high techy looking cameras sitting on each corner. The trees were thick the entire way until we reached an opening. Everything was dark in color. Dark grey packhouse sat in the middle with a black roof. There wasn’t any plants or greenery. It was either concrete or metal. My heart immediately broke for those kids.noveldrama







###Chapter 269
Chapter 0269 People were coming and going in different directions. Piles of furniture, clothes, blankets and pretty much everything was being tossed out. I saw can of gas off to the side with a torch and knew exactly what they had in mind. I wasn’t against this. What surprised me was Jasper sitting on the step. “What are you doing?” I yelled as I got out of my car. Alec was even confused. “I wasn’t about to spend another day in that place. A man needs fresh air.” Jasper tried to stand up Emmy kept him firmly in place. “Don’t get up. You should be in bed.” “I have my wolf and am healing good. I’m just going to sit here and watch everyone else work.” Jasper laughed but bent over in pain. “I’m going to be dragging your as s back to the hosptial if you don’t start relaxing!” Emmy was scolding him as passing women were trying to hide their laughter. Alec and I went up the stairs and into the depressing house. The entire place was spotless but yet looks like it was something out of a horror movie. Stained glass windows of wolves were actually quite pretty in a horrifying way. Part of me didn’t want them to get destroyed but I didn’t want any remembrance of this place. However it would be the ultimate f uck you to keep them and put them in a women’s shelter or something like that.

“What are you doing?” Alec asked. I didn’t realize I had stopped walking. “Those stained glass windows. They are beautiful in a way. I was trying to decide if I wanted to keep them and use them to design “That isn’t your worst idea.” Alec grabbed my hand and pulled me down the hall. The office door was open and we could hear Penny talking to Colt. “…complete mess! For a man that wanted woman to keep things clean, he was a pig!” “I see things are going smoothly here.” I didn’t even try to hide my smile as we walked in. noveldrama

“This is all yours!” Penny had hair sticking out in every direction. “The big bad Penny has a situation you can’t handle?” I teased. She put her hands on her hips and glared at me. Something she has never done. “You already had it organized by the time you gave it to me. This is just….” She waved her hand around like a crazy person. “How about I will work on this, I believe I heard the kitchen needed helped deciding what to keep and what food to throw away.” I was giving her an out. “You know what!” She was a little hysterical at this point. “I’ll just do that!” She stomped out and it was all I could do to look at Colt. “She is a little overwhelmed right now.” He looked like he was exhausted just from listening to her. “However, we do need your help.” “I got it. You just move over.” I said as I pushed his chair out of my way. “Thank, sis.” Colt stood up and walked over to Alec. “Why don’t you guys figure out who is going where and move on t the warriors. This might take me awhile. Send Emmy in here whe she if she is done yelling at Jasper.” “All the women are yelling.” Colt sighed. “I haven’t yelled yet!” I acted offended. “Yet being the key word.” Alec muttered. I was looking down and made a show up slowly moving my eyes up. Colt laughed as he darted out of the room and Alec just smirked but came over to give me a k*ss. “Get your as s out of here.” I faked grumbled as I started shifting through the paper files. I found everything. The paper trail of his attack on our packs. How he planed on flattening it and what he wanted to do with the land. There was an entire files on the different businesses he owned and what they did. Most of these will fall back in the hands of the banks and will be up to them to sell or discontinue the business. What I wouldn’t give to have all this information last week.







###Chapter 270
Chapter 0270 More than once I heard a few things out of the window that burned at my curiosity but the anger I felt from Alec told me I didn’t want to actually see. Emmy had found me a few boxes that she was working on putting the paper work into. I was finishing up saving different things to the flash drive before deleting everything else. In the end, it was getting late as the sun was starting to set. “How’s it going?” Alec asked as he and Colt walked in the door. “Good. Carry these to the car for me?” Emmy answered for us. They listened instantly and grabbed a box before walking out of the room. “How’s the baby?” I asked. “Good. Growing like a weed.” Emmy sat down and let out a long sigh. “Boy or girl?” I asked as I turned the computer off. “We wanted to be surprised.” Emmy rubbed her belly. “Where is Jasper?” “Probably doing something something that will end him up in the hospital.” Emmy grumbled.

“Speaking of hospital….” Penny walked into the room. “Oh?” I looked at her, knowing where this was going. “I want to meet them.” Right on cue, both Alec and Colt walked through. “Meet who?” Ale asked as he sat down beside Emmy. “Cassie and Zac.” Colt looked at me. “Penny, they were in really bad shape…” I tried t “I know but we need them to reject the title so we can move forward with the plans and… I just want to meet them.” “Honey, you understand they didn’t abandon you?” Colt wasn’t against it but was hesitant like I was. “I know that. We talked about this last night.” She glared at him. noveldrama

“Penny…” I started. “If You Were in m position, would you allow anyone to hold your back? Penny rounded on me. “Fine. You want to meet them? Then go to the hosptial but you need to understand the trauma Cassie went through. Not to mention Zac. They look rough and everything they did for the last 19 years was to make sure you were safe and loved. Whatever you think or feel, remember that.” I gave Colt a look that said, she was your problem. “Come on.” Colt sighed. I wanted to follow them as I was the only person Cassie really would know. “Are you okay?” I asked, Penny. “I mean, you seemed a little stressed out earlier.” “I’m stressed and can’t focus because I know they are here. I can’t get them out of my head so if it means I need to meet them in order to focus than I will.” It made sense but I was more afraid of how she would handle this. Penny was such a gentle soul that meeting her parents after all these years might be too much. As we approached the hosptial, there was one guard standing in front. Like the rest of the area, it looked gloomy. The white had faded an needed a good pressure wash. What was once green vines hac overgrown one side but now it was all dead and crumbling. Even the “Alpha, Luna.” The guard said as we each passed. He held the door open for us but quickly closed it after. Only emergency lights were on, making the hallway dark. I have expected someone to pop out of one of the rooms with a knife. Maybe I watched too many Michael Myers movies. I was out of it so when Alec stopped right in front of me, I walked right to him. “Oh, sorry!” I mumbled as I took a step back. “Penny, let me go first and tell them what is happening, okay?” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! 






###Chapter 271
Chapter 0271 “O-okay.” She looked like she was second guessing her decision. Colt pulled her into a hug and she immediately buried her face in his chest. He looked at me and nodded as I opened the door and walked in. Alec sl*pped in beside me but shut the door quickly after him. Standing off to the side, he folded his arms like a da mn b*dyguard. Cassie had bandages everywhere. Her neck was completely covered and her face had yellow spots. Blankets were pulled up to her chest so I couldn’t see what the rest of her looked like. An I.V was sticking out of her hand. Zac must have taken a shower. His hair was brushed and pulled into a bun at the base of his neck. They obviously had given him a razor too because his beard was trimmed. There was some bruising but overall, he looked good. He was sitting with a chair next to Cassie and held her hand gentle. Both of them looked over at me as I came in. “How are you feeling?” I asked. “They gave me something to give me back my wolf. I am still very weak so she is struggling right now. I want to thank you for saving me.” Cassie sounded weak but she tried to smile.

“You understand that since Rip was killed, the alpha title was transferred to you.” JJ “I realized that. I’m assuming you want us to give it up.” Cassie didn’ show any emotion as she spoke. “It would be the right thing to do. You both are not in any position t run a pack, let alone make decisions about innocent lives. You hav been in a cell, abused and starved for 19 years. The world has and abused in a different way. Men tally, you both need time to healt and adjust to life.” “Child, we aren’t going to argue. We don’t want it but we don’t want to give it up to anyone.” Cassie tried to laugh. “Actually, Penny is here.” I said. Both of them snapped their eyes to

me. “What?” “Penelope, your daughter wants to meet you. I believe it would be in your best interest to pass the title to her. She is just outside the door.” “She wants to meet us?” Cassie looked scared. “She does. She doesn’t have a single expectation from you. Penny is taken care of and doesn’t need anything. She just wants to meet her parents. I have told her the basic of both of your stories. She knows she wasn’t abandoned because you didn’t love her but to protect her. Penny doesn’t need a mother or father. I shouldn’t need to tell you that she just wants to meet you and eventually develop a relationships.” Cassie looked at Zac for a second before looking back at me. “Please bring her in.” Nodding, I looked over at Alec. He went to open the door. A shaking Penny and Colt walked in. Both Cassie and Zac gasped as they looked at her. “This is Penny and her mate Colt. Colt is my twin an Alpha of Blue Fang Pack. If you haven’t guessed, this is Alec and Alpha of Black Moon Pack, my mate.” “She looks just like you.” Cassie had tears in her eyes. “Penny, this is Cassie and Zac.” I said, continuing the introductions “You are even more beautiful that I imagined.” Cassie said. She was slightly sitting up but moved her hand so she could press the button. Zac got the hint and moved her bed upward a little so Cassie was in more of a sitting position. A shock of pain passed through her face. but eventually passed. “Do you need anything?” Penny asked. “No. Thank you. Please, come closer.” Penny listened and walked closer but stayed out of hands reach. Colt went with her. “Can- can you tell us about your childhood?” Zac asked as he cleared his throat. “Oh, um… I had a good childhood, I guess. Although, I lived in the orphanage, I never needed anything. They always made sure we had plenty of clothing and I had many friends. When I got older, I

started getting into trouble. School was boring and well, Kris found me. She hired me to be her assistant and pushed me academically. She really turned my life around and gave me a purpose.” GET IT NOWnoveldrama






###Chapter 272
Chapter 0272 “Penny is incredibly smart and it just took someone to recognize it. She did all the hard work herself.” I chimed in. Alec walked up behind me and put his hands on my shoulders. He was really proud of me. “Are you going to college?” Zac asked. “I haven’t decided. Before Colt and I became mates, I was planning on. it. However, with the responsibilities of being a luna, I might not. Colt has told me to enroll online and see how it goes but I’m not sure that is what I want anymore. I want to help young kids. Kids that just needed attention like I did. What Kris did for me. This is what I want my luna run to be about.”

“I know it doesn’t mean much to you but you should know that we are extremely proud of you. I’m so sorry I wasn’t strong enough to be there for you but you have turned yourself into this beautiful woman. I prayed to the Moon Goddess every day for your safety and happiness.” Cassie had a few tears run down her face. “I… I would like you to give me the alpha title but I would like you to move into the packhouse as a guest. Colt has agreed to build you a house for you both to live in. You can design it however you want. W will cover all expenses until you can establish an income. Zac, you are allowed to join the warriors under a probation period if you wish Other than a few rules, you will be able to come and go as you pleas and we can get to know eachother.” Penny kept her back straight an voice steady. I was really proud of her. “Thank you. Of course we are willing to give you the title. We just want a chance to get to know you and any kids you may have in th future. I might not have been able to be a mom to you but I hope yo will allow me to be a grandma.” Cassie said as Zac stood up. He walked over to Colt, who moved Penny way. not go unnoticed by Zac. “I won’t lie and say that I am warrior material. After all these years, I have an authority problem and skills that are not exactly meant for a pack.” Zac paused as he looked at Penny. “However, I want to work on building that relationship and being a better man. I’ll gladly join the warriors

as long as you. understand that it’s going to be a process for me. I make no promises and might mouth off but if it means having a relationship with my daughter, I’ll do it.” He held out his hand for Colt. Colt looked at it for a second before taking it. “Thank you. I won’t be easy on you and I’ll push you and pi ss you off. I don’t take disrespect of any kind and will handle it. However, I do appreciate what you have done in order to protect Penny. Which is the only reason I am allowing this.” Zac nodded as he understood what he meant. After letting go of Colt’s hand, he walked up to us. “Kristen, I want to thank you for all you did for my li… for Penny.” Looking at Alec, he continued. “l apologize for being the one that shot you in the arm. I wasn’t trying to kill you but make it look believable to sell it. I understand the whole situation caused the life of an innocent man.” Zach actually looked apologetic over this. He took a step back and looked at Colt. “I an truly sorry about that young man’s life. I had hoped that you both. would be able to kill the rogues and that would be the end of it.” “We can handle that on the practice field another day.” I said after th room was quiet for a moment. Zac nodded as he knew what that meant. “Would you like to transfer the titles now?” Cassie asked.noveldrama






###Chapter 273
Chapter 0273 “Yes, let’s get it done.” Penny agreed. “I, Cassie Atwater, Daughter of Alpha Ivan and Alpha of Midnight River Pack, denounce my title as Alpha. Passing it on to my only living daughter, Penelope Atwater.” Cassie raised her chest up in pain from the title leaving her b*dy. “I, Penelope Jeffrey, Luna of Blue Fang Pack, accept the title of Alpha of Midnight River Pack. After a moment of silence, Zac laughed. “What’s funny?” I asked him. Penny was breathing heavy as was Cassie. “All this trouble was because Rip wanted Darin to take the title when he died. Now, Penny is an Alpha and so is her mate. There won’t be a stronger couple in the world than they are. He made them the strongest.” noveldrama

“Well, if they combine packs, which assume they are, won’t she lose the Alpha title and it will merge with Colt?” Cassie asked. “I’m not sure how that will work. Since she is an alpha female by birth I bet she will keep it.” I rested my head against Alec’s chest. “We are going to combine packs and drop the Midnight River nam There is too much death and destruction around it. I don’t want t remember it and all it cost me. However, if you would have been ab to keep me, I am betting my childhood would have been complete different and full of pain. You probably did the best thing by me ai gave me away. At least I had a shot at a good childhood.” That was probably the most grown up, mature thing I have heard fro anyone in a long time. The fact that Penny recognized what wou have been would be helpful in her healing process. Since she has 1 enforce them. “When will you be able to get out of the hosptial?” Colt asked. “They believed later this week or next week. Her neck still needs some healing.” Zac sat back down. “Okay, I will have a room ready for you both. When you are feeling up to it, we can discuss a housing

situation.” Penny sounded like she was ready to go. “Thank you. Whatever you wish.” Cassie smiled at Penny. “Please come visit anytime you feel you wish to speak to us. I am gong to respect whatever you do or do not wish to know but I would love to hear about your childhood more. What you like or dislike. Favorite foods or colors.” “I am going to have you transferred to the hospital at Blue Fang Pack tomorrow. I’ll come see that you are situated and comfortable.” That was Penny’s compromise and I was proud of her for it. “That would be lovely. It’s nice to have an actual bed.” Cassie patted the mattress. She seemed to not have realized what she said before she looked around the room at our expressions. “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’ mean to say something I shouldn’t have…” “You didn’t…..” Penny looked at me for help. “Cassie, I think we need to get back to the pack and finish going through some paperwork. We will be flattening the packhouse thi evening and leveling some of the buildings tomorrow. Thank you fo meeting us.” “Thank you for bring Penny to meet us. We are forever grateful. Knowing we can live our lives together in peace is all I could ever a: for.” Cassie smiled at Penny before looking at Zac. “I never stopp loving you.”






###Chapter 274
Chapter 0274 “How are you feeling?” I asked Penny when we got outside of the hosptial. The cool air was gently blowing my hair in my face. “Not sure. Like you said, I don’t need them but part of me wants their approval. It’s weird. I always wondered if they would be proud of me.” “I think they were very proud of you. I think they are more relieved that you had a good childhood. Cassie couldn’t give you that. She could have kept you and you could have been killed or been beaten your whole life.” “Its weird. Like, me ntally, I know you are right. It’s hard to wrap my head around this. Knowing what they saved me from is probably the easiest way to understand why they did it. Cassie looked so broken and weak.” Penny was going through so many emotions right now that it was hard to figure out which one she was feeling.

“Like you said, maybe over time you guys can develop a relationship. This is a whole new world to Cassie. She might pick up on a few hobbies that you can learn too. If you wanted to, that is. This is all or your terms. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.” Penny nodded but didn’t respond. The packhouse was coming up an everyone was standing around it. Emmy was standing on the stairs dishing out instructions when we walked up. “Good, you guys are back. Here is a list for both of you. On the list i members that with to go with each pack. I have also made notation about housing or any wishes they have. Everyone has their vehicle packed with their belongings.” Alec took our list and looked over it. Glancing at Colt’s list, he had about an equal amount of people. Emmy indeed had everyone list that we needed to know. How many children, ages, dietary needs, a “I wasn’t sure about Sherry so I went ahead and assigned rooms at the packhouse for your pack.” Emmy said to Penny and Colt. ” Obviously, you can change it but that is one less thing you need to worry about right now.” “Thank you.” Colt said after Penny failed to answer. Her hands were shaking and I started to think shenoveldrama

was breaking down. After all she had went through, her emotions were finally getting the best of her. “Is everything ready to go?” I asked quickly, wanting to get the topic off Penny to give her some time. “Yes, I did one last walk through. The office is cleaned out and boxes. are in our cars, food is out of the kitchen and everyone has all their belongings with them. We are ready when you are.” Emmy looked around like she was looking for something. After meeting eyes with Jasper, he nodded at her and she looked back at me. “Yup, we are good to go!” “Perfect.” I said. Colt took a few steps forward to address everyone. “Thank you all for moving on a timely fashion. I am Alpha Colt to those who are unaware. This is my mate, Alpha Penny. I am the Alpha of the Blue Fang Pack and Penny is the Alpha of the Midnight River Pack. She i the only blood heir to the title. Alpha Alec is the alpha of the Black Moon Pack. My twin sister and Alpha Alec’s mate, Luna Kris. You a have met Beta Jasper of the Black Moon Pack and his mate Betal Emmy. My Beta Jacob is not here currently but you may remembe his mate, Beta Sherry. We are all available to help those who need i Beta Emmy has already given us a list of people with who wishes t transfer to which pack. We will be merging the Midnight River Pac with our packs and the territory will be divided. The Midnight River name will be eliminated completely.” The crowd Everything I endured was for this moment. To free all these women and children. It’s hard to see the bigger picture when you only have part of the information but looking back at it all, I was naive to believe it was just about Darin wanting me as a mate.






###Chapter 275
Chapter 0275 “With that, we will start the deconstruction of this pack with the packhouse. Please back up and we will let this b itch burn.” Colt said with more humor to his voice. We got off the steps and backed away a good distance. Colt took the gas and went inside for a little bit before coming back out. Spilling some on the porch, he did a little line of gas down to the grass and over where we were standing. Penny handed him the match. Just as he was about to light it, he looked over at me. “Want to do the honors?” “I do.” Taking the match, I felt a rush as it scraped down the side of the box. The flame instantly came to life. All the trauma I endured. All the men tal games and scared feelings came up. I was letting. everything go. Kneeling down, I whispered so low that I doubt anyone could hear me. “With this, I am letting go of all the negative emotions and feelings. I am healed and any trauma and do not hold any anger in my heart.” The flame touched the gas and instantly shot forward. I barely got to stand up before the flame touched the house. A large boom and gas ball exploded as the house erupted into flames. My hair was throwr back but Alec was there to catch me. My b*dy didn’t blow back as fa but enough that I was thankful that he was there.

No one really spoke but just watched the b itch burn. It was a turnin point for everyone I think. The slight breeze made the smoke drift behind the house, giving us the best view. Windows broke as the wood was no longer able to hold the weight. The bricks fell to the ground, making a thud each time. I wasn’t sure how long we stood there but the moon was high in th melting the way the bricks would fall. Eventually, only the chimney stood and the rest was a pile of bricks and charred wood. “If you need a ride, there are van available for you to take. If not, please follow each Alpha as we head back to our packs. You will get your assigned rooms and turn in for the night.” Colt said. “Those going to the Black Moon Pack, we will have a meeting at 9am to discuss a few different things.

Please be on time in the conference room. I’ll make sure there are signs marking it clearly.” Alec said. Everyone nodded. Alec and I walked over to our vehicle and waited. We watched as everyone else got in their cars and got situated. No one was getting into the vans so I assumed they all had their own way to get there. Only once everyone was in a vehicle, did we get into ours and slowly start driving out. Where Colt turned one way, we turned the other. Everyone followed behind us as we slowly made our way out, making sure everyone was following us. Most of our pack had already arrived back in our pack so when we got there, there was many people standing at the front of the packhouse to welcome them. My heart was filled as I watched our pack go to each vehicle and help them unload their items for them. Emmy was standing at the front door, telling our members where to take our new ones. Alec and I stood off to the side to make sure we were not needed. Our warriors were carrying luggage to rooms, and even some older teens were passing out waters and snack bars. It took an hour to make sure everyone was situated and finally, everyone else went to be. I caught a glimpse of a few women putting out the signs to the conference room. Alec had sent out a mass minc link, telling our pack to be there as well. “How do you think Zac and Carrie will adapt I asked started getting ready for bed “I think Cassie will adapt well, Zac will probably need an adjustment or two.” GET IT NOWnoveldrama







###Chapter 276
I decided I didn’t need any clothes to sleep in so I just stripped n*ked and got under the covers. Alec had his back turned to me as he was putting his wallet. Wanting to mess with him, I pulled the covers up around my neck and hide my b*dy.

“He’s Colt problem so that’s good for you.” Alec took his pants and shirt off, leaving only his boxers.

“That is true.” Alec sighed as he sl*pped under the covers. His hand immediately went to my hip as he scooted closer to me. “Hmm, no clothes tonight?”

I wiggled closer to him so I was pressed tightly against him. His hand moved to my as s and squeezed it tightly. “Nope. I didn’t think they

were needed.”

A deep growl vibrated his chest as he rolled me to my back. Rolling with me, he got on top and pressed his l*ps against mine. “Not too sore from last night?” Alec whispered in my ear.

“Nope. I think you need to try again.” My claws scrapped down his back as he moved down my b*dy.

“Is that so?” His l*ps sucked hard on my sensitive spot under my breast. Making my back arch. threading my fingers through his hair, I pushed his head lower. “I see you are impatient tonight.”

“F uck me, Alpha.”

Alec’s eyes met mine as they flashed black. He didn’t even have to push my legs open as I spread them wider for him. My head snappe back as his tongue licked my c lit before sucking hard and shovin three fingers in. I felt my juices run out of me as he worked me. I wasn’t prepared for him to pull his fingers out and gently insert int

was fully in my a ss.

“How does that feel?” Alec grumbled as his tongue entered me.

“Oh !” My hips moved on their own as I rode his face. He added. another finger in my as s, widening my as s. “ALPHA!” My org asm hit so hard that I was vaguely aware of him remove his tongue but his fingers stayed in me. He moved them so fast that I felt everything relax and allow him to fully f uck me in the as s.

“That’s it, c um for me.” Alec said in a husky voice. Without warning and without waiting for me to come down, I felt something enter me before it started vibrating. When and were he got this toy, I had no idea but he was moving it in and out of me so fast that I could barely

stand it.

Only when he removed everything from in me that I was able to look just in time for him to shove his d ick deep in my p ussy. His eyes rolled back in his head as he pumped in me. Taking one leg, he pulled it over him as he straddled the other leg, my b*dy was twisted but he never stopped pumping in me. noveldrama

Only when I was ready to c um again did I feel him fully insert himself, shooting his seed in me. I felt each pulse of his seaman shoot out of him but he kept going in and out. I was so close but not quite there. Alec pulled his d ick out and quickly inserted it into my a ss as he put the vibrater into my p ussy.

“Oh f uck.” Alec groaned as his claws sank into my hips. I was

completely filled. It only took three more pumps before my or gasm hit again.

How Alec managed to turn me again was beyond me but.next thing knew, I was on my hands and knees. The vibrator was still in my pu ssy and his he was still f ucking my a ss, only he was completely ir







###Chapter 277
Alec stayed true to his word and out did himself from the night before. Everything was sore as I got dressed. The shower was good but there is only so much you can do when you have something shoved up your as s and p ussy at the same time.

“Why are you walking so gently?” Alec was smirking at me. His chest. was bare and only had shorts low on his hips. The way his arms were rested against the top of the door frame and he was leaning forward at me, had my panties wet.

“I’m not. Last night was good.” I tried to sound neutral. Alec growled before he let go of the door and was on top of me in an instant. I was only in my bra and panties so when he advanced on me, I was putty in his hands. One of his hands wrapped around my neck and the other ripped my panties off and shoved a finger in me. My legs opened to his touch as he pushed me against the wall.

His l*ps never left mine as he freed himself and shoved his d ick into. was so sore but d amn if he didn’t feel so good. His movements were soft as he f ucked me hard against the wall.

“OH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!” I moaned in his mouth. He kept going. I lost track but my head was swimming. My face was tingling and I couldn’t feel my legs, yet, he kept going.

“Have you had enough?” His voice was thick with restraint and

amusement.

“I…” Words were not forming for me to speak. With each thrust, I was more and more lost. Finally, only have my third , did Alec finally cu m in me. His movements caused my legs to give out as he lowered me to the floor. I didn’t have the strength to stay standing.

Alec was laughing as he walked out. Now, that was a good f ucking.

You have a few minutes to be

down there.”

“How are you standing?” I glared at him.

“I’m a man, love. making your legs go weak and numb is what I live for.”

“You did a good job.” I said breathlessly as I patted his hand before I

fell over.

“Now that everything is calm down, can we talk about having a baby?” Alec dropped that bomb on me as he tossed some clothes on my

head.

“Seriously? It’s not like you are being safe and using a condom.” Pulling the clothes off my head, I looked at what he gave me. It was a sundress. The cotton spaghetti strap dress was white with noveldrama

sunflowers on it. It flowed down to my mid-thigh. “A dress?”

“It will be easier to keep making your legs go numb all day.” Alec yelled at me as he walked out of the closet.

“All day?” I was both excited and appalled.

“I want a baby.”

“What if I have twins?” Sl*pping the dress over my head, I was able to put some sandals on before I tried to stand up. My legs were still a little shaky. Unfortunately, Alec was finding it funny to watch me

stand.

“I want like ten kids with you.” He was leaning against the bedroom door as I took small steps.

“I’m not sure about ten.” Looking at myself in the mirror, I fixed my hair and what little makeup I had on.

when you nipples start working then you can have what

want but if i am going to be changing my b*dy for them, there jettei be at least one that is my musí que

“Wal, but of the ten, fi sure there will be one








###Chapter 278
“You’re crazy.” I laughed as we came down the stairs. People were coming and going but everyone was laughing.

“Go sit down and I’ll grab you some breakfast.” Alec said to me.

“Thank you.” He slapped my as s as walked away. As much as I tried glaring at him, I couldn’t keep the smile off my face.

Emmy and Jasper were already sitting at the head table and the room was about 3/4’s full. As I walked up to them, Emmy got a smile on her face. “Look at that beautiful dress!”

“Alec picked it out.” I said as I took my seat. “How’s my little niece or nephew?”

“Good. Getting big.” She did look like she popped over night.

“You are a beautiful pregnant person!” Jasper said has he put his hand on her belly.

“You are just happy those hormones have leveled out.” I laughed.

“That is a plus.” Jasper nodded and Emmy shook her head.

“I was not that bad.” We both looked at her like she was crazy.

“If Godzilla was emotional, that was you.” Jasper said.

“Oh? So I am big and fat like Godzilla? You think I look like that?”

Emmy rounded on him right as Alec came over.

“What is going on?” He whispered as Jasper tried to backpedal.

“Jasper said she was emotional like Godzilla with hormones.”

“S hit, how many brain cells did he lose?” Alec looked over at them.

Too many, I guess.

mu ffin.

We listened to them argue for a few more minutes before people stopped coming in. This room was the biggest we had and it was completely packed full of people.

“Thank you all for coming!” Alec stood up and started talking. “Firstly, I would like to welcome all the new members we have acquired. Before this meeting is up, we will have you all denounce your ties to Midnight River Pack and join ours.” Alec paused, waiting for anyone to speak up or object. “If you wish to participate in any extracurricular activities, you are welcome to join in. There is a youth warrior camp coming up for teens who with to participate. It’s not required but if you want to be a warrior when you become of age, I suggest you do it. It is not limited to just males, however, there is a beginner’s class that might be more suited for women who wants to learn self defense or just learn to fight. We also have cooking and other activities you can do. Otherwise, we will have jobs available for those who need it. Please speak with Beta Emmy for more information on all of that. You are also welcome to email her. It is posted with mine

and Kristen’s emails in the information log at the front door. Lunch is

served between 11:30am and 12:30pm. If you are nice to the kitchen staff, you might be able to get something earlier or later, otherwise the kitchen is open 24 hours to those who need it. The only requirement is you clean up after yourself. We have not had a problem with that in the past and I would not like to start it. Dinner is served between 5:30pm and 7pm. Room service is reserved to those who are on bedrest from either injury or other means. You cannoveldrama

request a to-go order, otherwise it is completely based off availability. The staff are not your se rvants to order around and should be treated with respect.”

“Alpha?” There was a woman’s voice in the back that raised her hand.







###Chapter 279
Mary nodded and sat down. Alec walted for another question but everyone was quiet. “Next topic is general rules. At the packhouse, all the walls are completely sound proof. There is a recreational room. and a gym in the back of the packhouse that is open to everyone. Teens usually have a pizza night and hang out, play games on saturdays. They might have a bond fire. As long as they don’t get rowdy or cause issues, I let it happen. It keeps them off anything bad. Obviously, Kristen and I are available to everyone 24/7. If it isn’t an emergency, try to limit stuff to business hours but you will not be punished if it is outside of that. There are many things that are -happening around here that need our attention. Because of this, we

will not be in the office on a regular schedule. Email will be an efficient way to get ahold of us.” noveldrama

“I have a list of events and activities that I made a flyer.” Emmy stood up and showed Alec. “They are available in a pile in the back.”

There was a few whispers and concern looks like they thought Alec was going to punish Emmy for interrupting. “Thank you.” Alec said as he gave the flyer a quick overlook. “Beta Emmy has printed out flyers that are in the back for taking. There is a list of all activities that are coming up. Kristen still hasn’t had a luna ceremony and we had to cancel a few things that are going to be made up. Please see the flyer

and there is her contact information as workers will be needed.”

S hit, I totally forgot about my luna ceremony. “Thank you.” I said to Emmy. “Add prom and add a BBQ to it as a welcoming party for all of our new members.” Emmy nodded and wrote it down.

“Starting today, things are going to be hectic around here. We will have a funeral service to those who lost their lives. We will bury my parents, Alpha Marc and Luna Erin as well as the warriors who died

anything. Just please come pay your respects. After the funeral, anyone is free to continue to get settled. Any questions?” Alec looked around.

“Actually, Alpha Alec, since we are all here.” Emmy stood up. “Luna Kris wishes to have a BBQ party as a welcome to all of our new members. Give everyone a chance to meet and mingle. Find a club or activity you want to participate in. However, due to what I have planned and different events, the BBQ would best be scheduled for tonight.”

“Okay, BBQ tonight.” Alec agreed. He was a little confused but I doubt it bothered him what was going on. Emmy must have said something in the mind-link because he quickly changed his mood. “Does. everyone know what to say to denounce your ties?” Everyone nodded. No one stated they didn’t. “Good, please denounce your ties and I will accept everyone as a whole.”

Across the room, those who needed to denounce their ties did. Many clutched their chest as the pain was clear. Some kids started crying. as they felt their mother’s pain but some were still running around, smiling.

When everyone relaxed, Alec spoke up. “I, Alpha Alec of the Black Moon Pack, accept everyone here as a pack member.” He kept it short and sweet. Many murmurs spread of them accepting him back. I felt each one like a knife through my heart as my head exploded

again with more and more people.






###Chapter 280
Putting my head down, I closed my eyes as I processed this. Passing out wasn’t an option but this time wasn’t near as many people as it was when I did it with Alpha Marc. At one point, Alec put his hand on my shoulder, trying to take some of the pain away but eventually, it faded and I was just left with a pounding headache.

“Thank you all for coming. If you could please proceed to the funeral, we can pay our respects.” Alec finished as I looked up at him. He was still holding my shoulder but looking at everyone.

As soon as he was done talking, they got up and silently walked out of the room. Most of everyone grabbed a flyer. We got up and followed everyone else out of the room and down the walkway. Where Black Moon had their funerals was more in hidden place along the tree line. We had to navigate a few hundred yards until we came up to it. All the bodies were laid out on a bed of wood and straw.

No one spoke as they found a seat and we made our way to the front. Jasper tried to hold the torch but wasn’t able to so his dad, Betal Andrew did it for him. For some reason, that felt more appropriate.

“Thank you all for coming. I understand there is a lot going on today. Please stay for a short while but you are free to leave after the burning begins.” Alec said. He walked around to talk to Andrew for a moment. Alec took a moment next to his dad and mom. He said his

final goodbyes before moving on to each person who died. There was so much turmoil in Alec as he spoke to his dad. He was angry he died. but part of him accepted it without question. His mother wasn’t as painful. I think it was because of her wolf. Alec knew it was soon after if one mate dies, the other follows. Saying he expected it feels wrong but they are happy together in their after life, noveldrama

“Each of these sacrifices lead to our victory. Alpha Marc… Luna Erin…

of their class. Fought with their hearts and was the best man they could be. I was proud of stand next to them on the battle field. Their ultimate sacrifice saved so many lives that it is not possible to count. It brought peace to our area of the world. Saved women and children from abuse in all forms and created a brighter future to our next generation. Luna Erin… mom. She was the sweetest soul. She had a way of turning dad’s abrasiveness into something sweet. She truly cared about each member and fought to make each life count. Finally, Alpha Marc. I owe him everything. He taught me to fight, that being a leader isn’t someone that just yells at people below them. A leader is someone who encourages, supports and stands beside his fighters. At the end of the day, due to situations out of his control, mistakes were made but that didn’t mean he lost his love for each person. He died trying to save his warriors. I was… am proud to call him my father and my alpha. May the Moon Goddess allow me to be half the alpha he was.”

Alec stepped aside and looked at Andrew. He shook his head no so Alec nodded for him to light the fire. Andrew did just as he was told. Starting with Alpha Marc, then Luna Erin until each person was

engulfed in flames. Alec sat down beside me and put his hand on my thigh. Wrapping my arm around his, I just rested my head against his shoulder.

After about ten minutes, people started to get up and leave. One by one, everyone made their way out and it was only us four left. Andrew finally left after Alpha Marc was unrecognizable.

Finally, Alec got up and moved each b*dy to their hole and covered them up. Most of it was done so it didn’t take too much man power to accomplish it. Jasper wanted to help but he was in no position to do anything. His face was looking better, less bruised and even was sitting up straighter.







###Chapter 281
Chapter 0281 After he was finished, Alec sat down beside me, breathing heavy.” What now?” I asked. “Now, we need to go to Florida and finish uncovering what your mother left you.” Alec said. “That will have to be next week. This week is full.” Emmy said. “That’s fine. One more week isn’t going to change anything.” I sighed. “Take a ride with me?” Alec looked down at me. “A ride? As a bike ride?” I was confused. “Yes, a bike ride. I need to check the conference center is ready to go. Emmy had some events there and although the contractors said it was done, I haven’t looked at it.” “Do we have time for you?” I looked at Emmy.

“You do. I already penciled that in. You just need to be back at 4:30 at your shop.” Emmy smiled. “What a bo…” “No. I have it all handled. Even if you stayed here, there isn’t anything for you to do. The demo team is already working at the houses and I have most of the house designs people asked for so I just need to send a few emails and draw up a design. I have organized a little ribbon cutting at 4:30 but that will only take a little amount of time and we can be back at the BBQ at 6pm.” “To think I was worried about losing Penny. You are wonderful.” I leaned over and gave her a small k*ss on the cheek. “Yeah, remember that in a few months when I need off for three 1/3 “It’s okay. I’ll return the favor one day.” I laughed with her as she tried three times to stand up before she got her momentum going. “Better make it sooner than later, I want our kids to be the same age. and right now you are going slow.” “I’ll work on that.” I said as Emmy and Jasper walked away. “I should change first.” I said to Alec as he followed them.

“Nope, just sit on your dress. You will be fine.” Alec pulled me against him and k*ssed me. “I love you.” He whispered against my l*ps. “I love you, too.” I said back without hesitation. We walked back to our bikes. Alec must have told someone to bring them out because they were ready and waiting for us. Alec handed me my helmet and gloves before he put his on. When I saw he was ready, I got my bike started. It felt amazing to feel the power between my legs again. It was like I lost a part of myself and finally got it back. True excitement filled my heart as we raced down the driveway and into the open rode. Alec stayed right in front of me but kept looking at me in his mirror. Just like he did before we were mates. The butterflies came back as I even allowed my dress to fly up when there wasn’t any cars coming. The tension in Alec was leaving and being replaced by something. primal. I knew I was going to be in for it but that just made it more fun. His eyes would narrow at me but never once did he actually say anything. The whole ride was amazing. Pulling up to the convention center, I was surprised. It looked amazing. The parking lot of beautiful with trees planted for shade. The building was circular with a dome top. Everything looked classy and sturdy. 2/3 What?” My heart sank a little. “I had Andrew come out here and inspect it already.” “Then why are we here?” I was a little hurt by this. “Our getaway house is done.” Alec held out his hand for me. I had completely forgot about the treehouse. Walking in front of Alec, the path was even more narrow with the overgrown trees. I half expected it to be cut down but the builders did an amazing job at not damaging the forest. Walking up to it, my breath was taken away. It looked perfect. Dark stained wood covered the whole

thing. Solar lights lined the walkway, balcony and even the forest. Since it was still daylight, they weren’t on but that was okay. I wanted to see what it looked like now.noveldrama






###Chapter 282
Chapter 0282 My excitement got the best of me when I ran up the walkway and didnt wait for Alec. Running from room to room, I was constantly being surprised. Alec stayed on the balcony, watching and waiting for me. “This is amazing!” I said as I threw my arms around his neck. He caught me easily, k*ssing me. “I’m glad you like it.” “I need to use the restroom though.” Alec rolled his eyes. “Did you find it already?” noveldrama

“I did!” Smiling at him, I walked to the bathroom. I had a hunch there was what I was looking for in there. Locking the door, I tried to keep my emotions level. Digging through the drawers, I found what I wanted. I had no signs or symptoms of being pregnant but with not being protective and Alec wanting a baby so much, I figured I might as well take one and see. There was this nagging thing in the back of my mind, telling me not to drink tonight. I wasn’t due to have my period for another two days but why the hell not. Opening the package, I sat down and peed on the stick before putting it upside down and capping it. My legs were shaking as I finished. peeing and washed my hands. The two minutes weren’t up but my patience was. Grabbing it quickly, I fl*pped it over before I could talk myself out of it. There was one really dark line and a second lighter line. After checking the box, it mean positive. 1 Positive. I was positive for being pregnant. “WHAT?” I whispered as a smile crept over my face. My hand shook as I covered my mouth with one hand and held the test in the other. So many things went through my head. I wanted to surprise Alec but I don’t think I could keep this a secret. Everything in me burned to run. out to him and tell him. I wasn’t even scared. Knowing he was going to be thrilled is the best thing I could have asked for. Sl*pping it in my pocket, I walked out to Alec. He was leaning over the rails, looking at the city below

us. “I was just about to come find you.” He said as he pulled me in front of him. His head rested against mine. with his arms around me as we looked at the city. __”How are you feeling?” I asked him. “Happy…sad…overwhelmed. I don’t know. Burying your parents isn’t something I was prepared for but I was more scared of losing you.” I turned around to face him. “You will never lose me. I’ll fight anyone to get back to you.” “When did you become a softy?” Alec teased. “I’m NOT a softy. Just don’t mess around with what is mine.” Alec grabbed my thighs and picked me up so I was sitting on the rail. His hands sl*pped under my dress and around my as s. The pregnancy test fell out of my pocket and hit the floor. “What was that?” Alec asked as he looked down. ““F UCK!” I groaned. Alec bent down to pick it up. “This wasn’t how I was going to tell you.” I felt Alec’s b*dy freeze. One of his hands was still on my as but the other was looking at the two pink lines. “This is a pregnancy test.” “It is. I just took it in the bathroom.” 2/3







###Chapter 283
Chapter 0283 “Correct. We are pregnant.” I said as I waited for him to absorb the information. “You are carrying my child?” He looked at me, begging me to tell him. this wasn’t a joke. “Seriously?” “I’m serious. I’m pregnant and you are going to be a dad.” Alec looked. at me for a minute before he smashed his l*ps against mine. His heart exploded in happiness to the point it brought tears to my eyes. The way his arms held me tightly yet passionately was something I wasn’t ready for. “What….how did…. why didn’t…” Alec was stumbling over his words as he looked down at the test. “I honestly thought it was going to be negative. I don’t have any symptoms or signs. I’m honestly not even late yet, my period isn’t due for two more days. I just had this nagging feeling that I shouldn’t drink tonight. Couple that with our lack of being protective, I just figured why not.” noveldrama

“I can’t believe this.” Alec got down on his knee and put his face to my stomach. “Hey little one. This is your daddy. You are already so loved.” Threading my hands through his hair, I just watched him process the news. After awhile of him just resting his head on my lap, he stood up. “I’m glad you are happy.” “Are you okay with this?” He asked me as he wrapped his arms. around me again. I kept my legs open so he could sl*p between them. H o oking my ankles together, he picked me up and walked me into the livingroom. Depositing me on the couch, Alec laid beside me. “What do you mean?” I started k*ssing his neck and ear. “Are you ready for a baby? You have been so hesitant on wanting one.” His hand ran down my thigh to my as s. “The danger is over. I was worried about being pregnant and something happen and I would lose the baby. I didn’t want to my pregnancy at risk like that.” I tried to keep the graphics out of my words. “I’ll treat you like the princess you are.” Alec grumbled as I found my mark and sucked on it. His claws dug into my as s before he pushed my legs apart. “I’m no princess.” I said and took his hand, bringing it up to my l*ps. Keeping eye contact, I liked myself

off his fingers. His eyes darkened and shoved his fingers back in me.. “F uck me, Alec.” I moaned as he nibbled on my neck. Alec moved to straddle me. Lifting my dress, he pulled it off of me and tossed it on the floor. However, he didn’t start pounding away like, I wanted. Instead, he held my hands down as he worshiped my b*dy. Kissing every inch of skin from my neck, to my breast and down to my thighs. “So beautiful.” He muttered before his tongue licked my c lit. His movements were antagonizing slow. It was driving me mad as his fingers teased me. “Please! Alpha! I want you inside of me.” I groaned as I felt the pressure build. “That’s it.” Alec kept massaging so precise and slow. My legs were tightening around him. My face was going numb and I just wanted his d ick inside me. I was right on the edge. Making eye contact, I couldn’t hold back my Right on cue, Alec gave in and pinched my c lit, allowing my or gasm to explode over. I wasn’t even at the peak when I felt his di ck enter me. He wasn’t pumping hard but he kept his annoying slow pace. His l*ps cashed against mine. Wrapping my legs around him, he kept his slow pace. “Nope!” I moaned as I wiggled from under him. Alec was confused but allowed me to move him so he was sitting on the couch. Taking my panties off, I crawled on top of him. Moving my hips back and forth, his hands were tightly on my hips. Leaning back, I moved in an upward motion. Alec’s eyes rolled in the back of his head as he let out his own groan. 3/3








###Chapter 284
Chapter 0284 “Woman, you are making this hard.” He said through gritted teeth. Grabbing his shoulders, I started bouncing up and down. His hands. helped me keep pace. My fangs descended and Alec pulled me tightly against him. As my org asm hit, my fangs went in until they hit bone. His arms tightened around me until I pulled out and licked it clean. Alec didn’t wait as his fangs sank into me. Thankfully his arms were still around me as they kept me in place. My head fell back as his org asm hit and my b*dy exploded. When he finally pulled his teeth out, he didn’t allow me to move. Instead, he leaned back and pulled me against him. Every now and then, his d ick would twitch in me but I just kept my head against his chest, feeling each heart beat. “We need to head out.” I said after I glanced at the clock and it read 3: 15pm.

“Yeah, don’t want to be late for your ribbon cutting.” Alec pulled my head back and k*ssed me softly. Putting both hands on either side of his face, I looked deeply into his eyes. “Alec, I love you so much.” “You have no idea how much I love you.” Alec grabbed the back of my head and pulled me toward him. This was the type of k*ss that screamed loved, protection and acceptance. He was truly my other half to my soul. Alec let me go and I was able to get off of him. Grabbing my dress and underwear, I went back to the bathroom to get cleaned up. Alec went to another bathroom. So, by the time I was done, he was ready too. “We aren’t telling anyone about this, right?” Alec asked as he put my helmet on me. “Not yet. I can only be a few weeks along. I want to wait till later. There isn’t any sickness or anything yet.” Alec helped me get on my bike before moving to his own bike. Part of me was confused as he has never helped me with my bike before. Maybe put my helmet on but that made me think he was going to be a little extra while I was pregnant. noveldrama

“Okay.” “Are you wanting to tell people?” I asked as he got on his own bike. “I can’t wait to tell everyone you are pregnant with my pup.” Alec had this tw inkle in his eye at informed me I was going to have a long pregnancy. He was going to be very doting and attentive. Part of me loved it, the other part knew I was still capable of doing it myself. “I’m still going to start working out and gaining my muscle back.” I said in the mind-link as we started our bikes and got on the road. “With certain moderations you sure can.” “Modersations?” “You don’t need to squat 150lbs.” “You realize that a healthy workout routine is good for my b*dy and what is good for my b*dy is good for the baby.” “Yes but you haven’t been able to work out in how long? Your b*dy. isn’t used to it anymore. I’m not asking you to not work out but just don’t over do it, please?” Alec looked back at me. I could only see his eyes but the rawness of his worry was clear. “Okay, I’ll take it easy.” I could feel the worry through the bond. “Alec?” “Yeah?”







###Chapter 285
Chapter 0285 “What was the hesitation? I have money…” “It’s not about the money. I just always figured I would raise kids in the packhouse.” “I mean, we still can.” My heart sank a little. “I just want you happy and if it will make you happy to live in a different house than the pack house, then we will.” Alec said. That wasn’t good enough response and it sounded like he was just giving in. “We can discuss this later tonight or tomorrow.” I said. He didn’t argue but we fell into a silence. Not exactly uncomfortable but we were both in our own heads. Part of me worried I killed the high we were on. The joy of finding out you were pregnant but then I killed it by asking for a house. Pulling up to the tattoo shop, there was more people there than I expected. Camera men were standing they their vans, making sure the equipment was ready to go. A red carpet and a podium was out front with a massive red ribbon and bow. “Good! You are here!” Emmy walked over to us as I got off my bike. “This is more than what I imagined.” I said to her.

“I know, I went all out.” Emmy had a huge smile on her face. “I had so much help too.” “From who?” I asked. “From me!” Penny and Colt came around the corner. Sherry and Jacob also followed them. “Thank you all for coming!” I gave each of them a hug. It felt so good

Sherry and Jacob also followed them. “Thank you all for coming!” I gave each of them a hug. It felt so good. 1/2 “And miss this? Nope, we wouldn’t miss this for anything!” Jacob teased as he pushed my shoulder. Not enough to move me but to make a joke. “I can’t believe this is finally happening. After all we been through, we are finally getting back to a normal.” I just looked over at my shop in awe. The outside looked amazing. New decal was on the bullet proof glass. It was of a tattoo gun that was finishing writing the letter K. “Are you guys ready?” Someone called out. “We are!” Emmy grabbed my hand and pulled me along. “Okay, what is going to happen, there will be a brief overview of the shop and Melonie will announce the ribbon cutting. That will be your cue to cut the ribbon. After that, everyone will go inside. We will do a quick tour and then we are done. Any questions?” Someone with an ear piece was talking like I should know who he is. “Nope.” I said. I was pushed in the middle with only Melonie beside me. “Can I have my family standnoveldrama

with me?” I asked. “Of course. Have them stand just slightly behind.” Melonie waved everyone over. Alec stood right next to me with Emmy. Penny and Sherry stood in front of Colt and Jacob. This felt right. Alec’s hand went around my waist as the man raised three fingers, then two, then one… “This evening, we are gathered at the re-opening of Tattoo’s by Kris. Earlier this year, this location was the result of a random burglary. After completely remodeling, Kristen of Tattoo’s by Kris is ready to open her doors again.” Melonie turned to me. “Kristen, tell me what this means to you?” Well, s hit. I was caught off guard. “This means the world to me. Tattooing is something I loved doing. It’s more than a job to me. I today. No one will be able to keep me from living out my dream.” “What changes have you made since upgrading this space?” “Well, for starters, the security is much more advanced. Other than that, everything got a face lift and I added extra chairs in case I want to expand and hire more people.” “With this ribbon cutting, it sounds like we will be expecting great things from Kristen in the years to come.” Melonie took a step back and nodded to me. Grabbing the massive scissors, I cut the ribbon. and everyone clapped.







###Chapter 286
Chapter 0286 I didn’t realize how much this actually meant to me when I was able to turn and walk into my shop for the first time since I was 100% done. Everything was cleaned. Pictures were hung on the wall, lights were installed under the cabinets and even my computers were set up. Everything was polished and ready to go. Melonie walked around with the camera and said a few words before the camera got turned off. “That’s a wrap! Thank you for having us!” She held out her hand for me to shake. I wasn’t a short person but she towered over me with her perfectly manicured fingernails and red bottoms. “It was a pleasure.” I said. Pulling out a business card, she wrote something down before walking up to Alec. “Here is my business card if you ever need another expert. I added my cell if you want to discuss some business after hours.” He just looked at her but I wasn’t going to have that. “I’ll take that. I don’t think my husband is going to be calling you. He likes his women a little less needy.” Melonie raised an eyebrow at me and popped her hip out. “We will see about that.”

Alec held me back as she walked out of the shop. “I wouldn’t have hurt her…” I grumbled. “Yes you would have and we have had enough trouble.” Alec laughed as he pulled me into a hug. “I KNEW IT!” Emmy screamed. 173 “Knew what?” I stepped back from Alec and looked at her confused. “YOU DO GET JEALOUS!” Emmy was bouncing up and down, clapping her hands. “Not jealous, just don’t allow bi tc hes to look at what is mine. There is a difference. She isn’t a wolf and has no idea what I could do to her. Humans are reckless and I was just protecting him.” “That is a lot of words to use when describing jealousy.” Jacob laughed.

“I’ll kick your as s too!” I said as I glared at him. “Kris! We have one more surprise for you.” Penny yelled from behind my front desk. “What?” I looked confused. She walked out carrying a massive book. I recognized what it was right away. It’s the type of book that you use for a portfolio. “You got me a new book?” “Kinda.” Penny showed me the cover. It had a Black Moon with two wolves howling. The leather was fresh as I could smell it. Alec took the cover and opened it for me. My jaw hit the floor. It was of my very first tattoo. Alec kept fl*pping. Each picture was perfectly captured and showed off my work. “I don’t understand…” “Alec wanted to give you back something. Him and I together contacted everyone we knew who had a tattoo by you and asked to take a picture of it.” Penny filled in. “I know how much this shop means to you and how hurt you were when you saw your portfolio destroyed. I wanted to give this back to you.” Alec fl*pped to the last photo and it was of his back. He even had his back blown up and was hanging behind my front desk in a massive frame. 2/3 “Thank you!” I yelled as I threw my arms around his neck. He caught me and held me close so I could gather myself. “You know. We should really tell them you are pregnant. Otherwise, they will question why you are not drinking at the BBQ tonight.” Alec said in my mind-link. “You want to tell them that bad?” I laughed as he let me go. I went to hug Penny too. “Thank you, Penny.” I said to her. “It is only a small token of what you have done for me.” Penny had tears in her eyes. “I do.” Alec said in our mind-link. “Fine but you tell them.” I walked over and grabbed his forearm. Not his hand but just is arm. I wasn’t sure why I was so scared or nervous all of the sudden. However, I was and I wasn’t going to be able to get the words out.

“Thank you all for doing all this for us… for her. With everything that has been going on, having all of you beside us has truly been the only thing keeping us going. Keeping me sane, keeping Kristen safe.” Alec was even getting a little nervous. Were were all standing around in a circle. “I wish Jasper could have been here but Kristen and I do have some news to share.”noveldrama







###Chapter 287
Chapter 0287 “You are finally going to Italy?” Emmy’s eyes widen. “No.” I laughed. “Going to Florida?” Colt asked? “Yeah, we will go next week but that isn’t what he is trying to say.” I said as I looked at Colt. “Well, where are you traveling? It has been your dream to travel.” Jacob asked. Everyone nodded as they looked at us. “We aren’t planning on anything yet, other than Florida, we will need to wait till next year.” Alec looked down at me and smiled. “Next year? Why?” Emmy looked confused. “Because… Kristen is pregnant.” Alec said like a proud daddy. “WHAT?” Emmy screamed. “I’m not going to cry… I’m not going to cry.” “Seriously?” Colt basically pushed Penny out of the way and scooped me up. He twirled me a few times before putting me down on my feet. “You’re pregnant? I will get to be an uncle?”

“You will.” I said as he hugged me again. “If you weren’t her brother, I would be cutting your balls of for doing that.” Penny glared at Colt. “Move.” She pushed him out of the way and smiled at me. “I’m so excited for you.” “You will get to be Auntie Penny.” said as I hugged her back. Colt gave Alec an actual hug before stepping back and shaking his hand. Jacob just shook his hand. 1/3 “How far along are you?” Emmy asked. She lost her battle to not cry. “Not very. I’m not actually due to miss my period for another two days. I just had this feeling I shouldn’t drink so I took a test.” Alec pulled out the test and showed them. “So, no symptoms?” Emmy asked as she looked at the test. “None yet.” noveldrama

“That is bul ls hit but I am so happy for you.” Emmy finally hugged me as Alec put the test away. “Congratulations!” Sherry walked up to me and gave me a hug. She was really starting to open up and show her personality. Colt was trying to make it up to Penny but she was blocking his attempts to k*ss her. “Are you going to find out the gender?” Emmy asked. “I haven’t honestly thought about it, or names before you ask.” Shrugging, I looked at Alec. He was just beaming at me. “Do you want your crib now?” Penny asked. “Yeah, I’ll take it. Not sure where we will put it but I do want it.” I said. “Knowing the gender, you can be so much more prepared.” Emmy gave me a look. “Just because Jasper is wanting to keep it a surprise doesn’t mean you can’t be prepared.” I laughed as sl*pped under Alec’s arm. “I don’t know if I should buy a dress or athletic shorts!” Emmy tossed her hands up. “Girls can wear athletic shorts!” I argued. “Just because you are incapable of looking nice every day does not mean other girls don’t like to dress up! If this is a girl, Jasper wants 2/3 WYWIIL LU iad yn uIIUL uvcJ DULII. “It will be so much fun to watch you navigate this world.” I laughed. “Just you wait!” Emmy gave me a look. “I don’t have to. I can watch all your mistakes and not make them.” I knew I was poking the bear but it was funny. “Okay! Before you bust that vein, let’s get to that BBQ!” Colt laughed as he pulled Penny along with him and sl*pped Emmy under his other arm. “You are coming to the BBQ too?” I asked.

“Most of my pack is, actually. Emmy called this morning and invited us. Give people a chance to really mingle.” “If I can’t drink, neither can you.” I whispered in Alec’s ear before giving him a look and walking away. He just raised on eyebrow at me and followed after me. Grabbing the keys from the counter, I locked the door and headed towards our bikes. “Is that so?” Alec whispered in my ear as he passed me and went to his bike. “It’s only fair…” I laughed. “I’m joking. You can do whatever. I wouldn’t ask that of you.” I rolled my eyes and put my helmet on. He didn’t respond but put his helmet on. I had already started my bike and drove off by the time he started his bike. The race was on. I wasn’t speeding nor was I driving reckless but this might be the last time I will be on my bike until I had this baby so I was going to enjoy it.







###Chapter 288
Chapter 0288 By the time we made it to the packhouse, the place was crawling with people. People I haven’t seen in years were there. Though, I might have seen them at a funeral but this was the first time I was able to actually talk to them. “I am to change first.” I told Alec as got off my bike. “Change?” Alec looked confused. “Why?” “I smell like S*x and there is a little spot right here.” I showed him a spot on the inside of my dress that had some dried liquid to it. “So?” Alec challenged.

“I’m going to change. I will be right down!” I pulled his shirt down to give me a k*ss before running off to our room. Being that I was going to start showing, I needed something that showed off my figure but was still professional. There was a little sundress I kept in the back of my closet, compliments of Emmy. I was always too reserved to wear it. However, feeling rather comfortable in my skin, I wanted to finally p it on. It was easy to pull of my sunflower dress. Taking my bra off and underwear, I only grabbed white lacy underwear to wear. The dress was spaghetti straps with a tight top. Tight enough that I didn’t need to wear a bra and gave me perfect lift. The white lacy top went to my natural waist with a golden metal belt. It flowed down into a white skirt with pink and rose colored flowers. The skirt itself was somewhat flowy but if a guest of wind came, nothing would be shown. It stopped mid to high thigh, making it questionable. However, this wasn’t a professional atmosphere but a relaxing one. Finishing off my look with some golden strappy sandals, I fixed my hair and was read to go. Knock! Knock! Knock! “Emmy?” Opening the door, I was surprised to see Emmy standing there.

“Look you f ucking amazing!” She eyed me up and down. “Do you think?” I asked as I gave her a twirl. “I do! Alec wanted me to come check on you.” Emmy was smiling from ear to ear. “Why?” I asked. “You really have worn the perfect dress.” Emmy grabbed my arm and pulled me down the hall. “Why?” I was so confused. “Just smile and keep walking.” Emmy pulled me down to the back door. As soon as she opened it, I realized this wasn’t just a BBQ. Alec somehow had changed into slacks and a white polo. He was standing down a flowery path that lead through everyone. Emmy gave me a small push as she walked outside and closed the door. My feet moved on their own as I walked down the path to Alec. Grabbing my hands, he looked into my soul. “We will have a luna ceremony for you. Have all the food we picked out and all the decorations you wanted. However, with everything that has happened, I wanted to give you something.” Alec pulled out a ring from his pocket. I immediately recognized it as the ring his mother had worn. “This ring has been passed down through generations.. Every Luna from my great great grandma to my mother wore this ring. It was my mother’s intention on giving it to you on your luna ceremony but I wanted it to be worn by the luna. This ring symbolizes our unity and our commitment together. Not only our commitment as mates but our commitment to run this pack as one. Neither is above noveldrama

you have already shown every single person here how much you care by laying down your life numerous times to save another. Please accept this ring as we move forward into this next chapter of our lives.” It was all I could do but shake my head yes as he sl*pped it on my finger.







###Chapter 289
Chapter 0289 “Are you ready?” Alec asked as he got on the plane. It had been an entire week since we found out we were pregnant. Since then, I had went to the doctor and confirmed my pregnancy. So far, it is a health. pregnancy with no symptoms. Since it was still really early at four weeks, we haven’t told anyone else. Obviously, Emmy told Jasper right away but that was it. Currently, I was sitting on a seat in the private air plane. I kept admiring the ring he had given me. Platinum metal had a singular black one karat circle cut diamond. The band had a twisting pattern. around it. The black diamond, I learned later represents the Black. Moon name. Alec’s great great grandpa mined this stone and designed this entire ring. The metal had to get replaced due to the wear over the years but they kept the design and the stone. “Eath to Kristen!” Alec waved his hand between my eyes and the ring. “What?” I looked up, surprised. “Ready go to?” Alec sat down. He was breathing a little heavier. “Yeah, get all of our bags?” I asked. He refused to let me help so I came and sat down on the plane. “Yeah, we are good to go.” Alec looked back at the pilot and nodded. A flight attendant shut the door and went to his seat and sat down. My eyes landed on the window as I watched everything fly by up until

we soared in the sky. “Can I get you anything to drink, Luna?” The flight attendant asked me after the plane leveled out above the clouds. “No, thank you.” I gave him a smile before looking back out the window. 1.3 “Alpha? Would you like a whiskey or water?”

“I’m good, thank you.” Alec answered. I was joking earlier but Alec has not touched a drop of alcohol since we found out I was pregnant. “Are you feeling okay?” “Yeah, tired.” That was really my only pregnancy symptom. However, I really didn’t call it a symptom. We have been so busy this last week that I have been exhausted. Alec has tried to get me to go bed at eight every night but it hasn’t worked. So far, we have started a new housing development for our new members. People have asked to join different clubs and more women as asking to work in the packhouse. It is what they did at Midnight River and they felt comfortable doing it. So, we had to make different jobs for people and shift things. The kitchen staff was excited to get more help and welcomed it. The new members even showed our staff some new recipes they are excited to try. Colt and Penny have brought over the crib and everything else. It is hiding in our room. It is common knowledge that I got it from my mother so there aren’t any questions going around about that. “Come here.” Colt moved over next to me and allowed me to put my head on his chest. Closing my eyes, I listened to the sounds of the plane, rocking me to sleep. “Kristen, we’re here.” Alec shook me, gently. “What?” It was really bright as I tried to open my eyes. After a few times, I was able to look down the see the ocean. The plane had just started it’s descend so I could still see the world below me. My nerves were getting the best of me as we touched down. Not from flying but what could be in the storage unit. Alec helped me stand as the flight attendant opened the stairs. There was already some people unloading our luggage and loading it into a vehicle. 2/3 “The keys are in the ignition, sir.” Everyone here were human but Alec must have paid to get the private plane and car service. “Thank you.” Alec opened the door for me. After getting in, Alec walked around and got in the drivers seat as the truck got shut. “Where are we going?” I asked, unsure if we are going to the hotel or storage unit first.

“Where do you want to go?” “To the unit.” I said looking at him. “I need to know what is in there.”noveldrama








###Chapter 290
Chapter 0290 Alec nodded as he put in the directions. 318 Crestview Drive, Destin. It automatically came up. We were only fifteen minutes away from the biggest secret my dad had. Alec held my hand still from tapping on the center consol. “Relax, love.” “I’m trying.” The traffic was crazy. I hadn’t seen palm trees before and watching them blow over in the wind was crazy. The wind had a salty smell to it, letting me know we weren’t far from the ocean. The navigation had us turn into a gated area. Stopped at the window, an holder gentleman poked his head out. “Unit number?” “Oh, um…” I wasn’t sure what the number was. “It will be the number on the key. Do you have the key?” The doorman seemed annoyed. “Yes.” Opening the envelope, the key dropped into my hand. There was just a four on it. “Um, four.” I told him. “Four?” He looked shocked.

“Yes, four.” I held it over Alec so he could see. “Dam n.” The guy disappeared into his little brick area, only to come. back with a cl*pboard and a pen. “Please sign this.” Alec handed it to me. It was a basic noticed that I received the envelope that was attached. “What’s that?” Alec asked. “No idea. We were instructed years ago that when someone came to get into that unit that they recieve that letter. We just need a signature that it was delivered and to assist you in anything you need.” 1/3 Taking the letter, I signed the paper and handed it back to him. “Thank you.” “Your unit is to the left on the far end. Let me know if you need anything.” He gave us a bow before

opening the gates. “That was weird.” I said when we were out of ear shot.” This place. was incredibly upscale. White painted brick was at least fifteen feet high with cameras in every direction. “It was.” Alec creeped the car down the row until we saw the number four. Alec turned off the car but didn’t make a move to get out. Instead, he reached over and moved my chin so I was facing him. Breathe love.” Immediately, I sucked in a gulp of hair that I didn’t realize I needed. I’m sorry, I don’t know why I am so nervous to look in here.” “I’m right here with you.” Alec looking into my soul through my eyes. Ready?” I didn’t speak but I nodded. “Should I read this letter first?” I asked. “Yeah, go ahead.” Alec kept his hand on my leg. Somehow, I managed to not give myself a paper cut as I opened it. The paper was incredibly delicate as I pulled it out. The handwriting was elegant. Dear, my sweet daughter, Kristen, If you are reading this, than I did not make it out of the delivery room. Your father thought I was crazy when I told him I had concerns. Even the doctor didn’t believe me. So, I took matters into my own hands. and I am writing this letter. There is so much I wanted out of life for you. I wanted to watch you grow up, find your mate and be the best version of yourself. I want noveldrama

you will umuyo uc little girl. I had instructed your dad what to do with this stuff if I was to ever pass away and if it wasn’t safe in my family’s house anymore. Floridal has always been a special place in my heart. The beach was a place. that my parents took me and I wished to take you. So, by moving it all here, I was able to make sure you at least visit the beach once in your life. Hopefully, you will fall in love with it like I was. There are many things in this unit that I hope you will appreciate but there are also items that are

priceless. Family heirlooms that cannot be replaced and are worth money. had everything appraised a few years ago. Depending on when you find this, you might need to get them reappraised. However, it is my wish you do not sell them but keep them in your family.







###Chapter 291
Chapter 0291 Just know, I will be watching you from above. I am proud of you and I love you. Love, Mom If we have a daughter, can we name her Adalynn?” I asked. There weren’t tears in my eyes but I mainly just felt numb. “Of course we can. That would be a great way to honor your mom.” Alec k*ssed my forehead. “Ready to see what is inside?” “I am.” Setting the letter down, I opened the door to the humid Florida heat. Alec had taken the key and was unlocking the door by the time I came around. With the years of weather, it was a little worn but he was able to get it open. With a snap, the lock opened up and Alec raised the door up. Everything was covered in sheets. Alec grabbed the first one and pulled it off. It was hand drawn pictures in golden frames. The pictures were of different people or a scenery. Alec and I shift through them until he stopped. “Look at the signature.” He pointed down. At the bottom right corner, it wa signed Adalynn Jeffrey. “Mom drew these?” “I guess that is where you get your talent from.” Alec had a smile on his face. He left me to keep looking through them as he continued to take off the sheets from everything.

Behind the paintings were more art supplies, an easel, and many different art books. It looks like mom had studied art on a college. 12 HIGH here.” I said to Alec. “Kristen, look at this.” Alec called from the back. supplica

Walking to the back, there was a massive mirror. Alec had opened it to reveal it completely filled with jewelry. “What’s the envelope?” I asked that was taped to the top. Alec grabbed it and opened it. “It is the appraisal for each piece.” Alec shifted through them. “That ring is worth one million dollars.” Alec pointed a particular beautiful ruby stone on a golden band. “Are ou serious?” I asked. you “Well, twenty years ago it was worth one million. Today it will be much more than that.” Alec sounded shocked. “What are these?” I looked over at another stack of vanilla envelops in a box next to the mirror. Opening the first one, it was bonds. “Holy f uck.” Alec looked at the one I was holding. “She has a large fortune in here.” “It’s all our, now.” Alec started opening more boxes. Some where just clothes or different vases. There was fur coats and collectables. “Basically, everything that was her family’s that was worth anything is in here.” Alec said. There was around a hundred different drawings that mom had drawn and some that must have been her mother or aunt’s. “What are we going to do with all this?” I asked. “Take it home. Hang some of these up. Give Colt some. Keep the jewelry safe. We don’t need the money. I put the five million that hit the bank from your dad’s death in savings. We can do whatever with it. Save it, build the house you want or even use it for something else.” 213 “We need to keep all this private so no one comes to steal it.” I said.. “We could buy a bank and keep it there.” Alec joked. “That really isn’t a bad idea.” noveldrama

“I was joking but we could do it.” Alec looked at me. “Let’s go to the beach and talk about this. That was my mom’s last wish and I want to see it through.” “Anything for you.” Alec scooped me up and k*ssed me as he carried to me our car. Watching Alec lock up the storage unit, I realized all my dreams came true. I didn’t need to travel to find happiness. I already had it. Alec got in the car. After started the engine, he put his hand on my stomach as we drove to the beach. 3/3 Mrs. Smith

###Chapter 293
Chapter 0293 Colt and Penny’s story. Penny’s POV “How are things going in here?” Colt walked into our office. Since we renovated the entire packhouse, it was more light and welcoming. Lightly stained hard wood floors went beautifully with the white. distressed accent furniture pieces. However, my favorite part of our office was our desks. We each had our own area. Knocking down the wall, we took out a spare bedroom and really opened it up. Per my request, Colt put in a floor to ceiling glass wall that let in all the natural lighting I could ask for. Currently, I was staring at different paintings and trying to figure out which ones I wanted to hang. Since Kris had everything in the storage shed moved back a week ago, her and Colt have split most of it all. She obviously kept the jewelry but she graciously shared their mother’s paintings/drawings with him. noveldrama

“I think we should put this beautiful charcoal drawing of this wolf head behind your desk. I love this one of the owl. That one should be behind mine.” His desk was in the original place his father’s desk was and mine is where the bed used to be. Each of us have large matching rugs and a joined seating/relaxing area. Taking out the bedroom door, there is only one entrance. However, we did put in a built-in collapsable wall so if I needed privacy for any reason, I would have it. “Okay.” Colt nodded and leaned against my desk. “You don’t honestly care do you?” It was both annoying and welcoming. I wanted him to have an input but I just wanted his opinion to match mine. Truthfully, I was a little stubborn when it 1/3 anything at all and the rest was my creative freedom. Never once did she redistrict my creative process. However, Colt was my mate and I wanted a different relationship with him when it came to this stuff. “I care, I just don’t really know where it should go and you are so good with it all. Whatever you think it best.” He looked out the window like

his mind wasn’t even focused on this. “I can feel your anxiety. What is going on?” Usually, Colt only felt this way when it came to a topic he knew I wasn’t going to like. “Your…. Cassie is ready to be discharged from the hospital.” My b*dy froze. I knew this was coming but I haven’t visited her since I met her the first time. I knew I told her I would come back but it hasn’t happened. More than once, I walked to the hospital and turned around. I wasn’t sure what was stopping me. Something just held me back from going in. The staff saw me on more than one occasion. Thankfully, they just nodded in understanding when I turned away. Never once trying to get me to come in. Images of her laying in the hospital flashed before my eyes. She looked broken. Bandages covered what little of her neck that was sticking out and bruises covered her arms. Zac looked dangerous and not someone I was comfortable around. Even though I wasn’t as good as friends with Ace as Colt was, I was still finding it hard to forgive him. “Oh?” I wasn’t sure what else to say. Picking up the owl drawing, I held it up against my freshly cream colored walls. The darkness of the owl really looked good against it “I need to know what you want. Do you want them on the other side of the packhouse or next to us?” Colt said in a soft tone. “When will the house be done?” I asked, not sure how close I wanted







###Chapter 294
Chapter 0294 “I know. I-I just can’t figure out why I feel this way. Why don’t I want to see them?” Looking into Colt’s eyes, I pleaded with him to have an answer. However, the sympathy in his eyes told me I wasn’t going to get that. Your entire life, you thought they abandoned you. That is 19 years of anger and confusion that isn’t going to go away in one week. As much as you try to hide it or not feel it, you can be angry. No one expects you to just forgive and be their daughter again.” “I’m not like Kristen. I can’t just have this don’t give a f u ck attitude and move on. I feel things more deeply.” There was a part of me what felt like Colt always compared us together. Even though he denies it. “You need to find your own way of dealing with this but you do have to deal with it. Unless you want to make them go live with Alec and Ice, they are our problem. I’ll even let you punch Zac a few times if that will help?” He tried to make a joke but I didn’t fall for it. He wast right. I did need to find a way to move on. “Deal with it how? Be the loving, forgiving daughter?” That kind of pis sed me off he said that. “I didn’t say that. I said you needed to find a way to deal with it. If that way is anger and you yell at them, okay. If you want to confine them to their room, that is okay too but ignoring this isn’t going to make it go away. I will support you in whatever you choose on how to deal with this. I love you and this baby growing inside of you deserves to have a home with zero negativity. Plus, we are living at our house anyway. Having them here isn’t like we will be their neighbor.”

My hand went over my stomach. I had just found out I was pregnant yesterday. Colt was the happiest I have ever seen him. Annoyingly so, 1/3 ne was nym. I urun mun to raide our mumu nome main grow up with. Constantly looking over their shoulders. Flinching anytime

someone raised their hands. I knew why Kristen was the way she was but I didn’t want to be that person. My shelter for abandoned kids was being built as we speak. There was plans for changes in the school system to help those who are academically advanced. Kristen had started it but I wanted more. What they didn’t know, I had started planning on changes I wish were. there when I was growing up as a teenager and now I planned on implementing them. “I guess put them where ever makes sense in the packhouse. You’re right. We don’t live here and I can always stay here or go home if I need space. I still don’t want Cassie or Zac to know where our home. is.” “Whatever you are comfortable with.” Colt pulled me into a hug. “I will be beside you ever step of the way.” “I wish I had someone here with me. As much as Sherry has relaxed and working through her issues, I don’t have help or a friend sten took Emmy with her.” “I thought you and Sherry got along?” Colt was puzzled by this. “Oh, we do get along but she is still working through her issues. I can’t talk to her like I could Emmy or Kris. Part of me still feels like she needs a mentor than a friend.” “Maybe she feels like you don’t view her as a friend?” Colt said back to me. “What?” That surprised me enough that I pulled back and looked up at him. Colt was frowning as he looked down. “Jacob told me that Sherry confessed to him that she feels alone here. She wants to have. “I like Sherry! She is just so timid and never says anything so l assumed she wasn’t ready so I never tried to push her.” I was appalled at what I was hearing. “Does she really think that?” 3/2noveldrama







###Chapter 295
Chapter 0295 “She does. She is your beta and I think maybe you should give her a task or two and see how she does. Maybe she will surprise you. You can start with having her organize the packhouse kitchen schedules. There hasn’t been a menu out and we used to have one for the whole month. The staff has been frustrated with not knowing what to buy and it’s been a little crazy with who’s responsibilities are whose.” “Why hasn’t anyone told me?” I was crushed by this. “Really? You have been slammed with making sure people have a roof over their heads. We have how many projects going on to support all of our new members? For some reason, you and Kris think we still need a prom. We have your’s and Kris’s luna ceremonies coming up. Plus, I saw something about inviting how many packs to, ours to hold a huge party?” “That was for their benefit! Kris and wanted to see if any of the women would take chosen mates or even find their mates. By inviting all these packs, it would give a better chance for those who never had a mate to find theirs or those who lost their mate and survived, find one that will help them survive longer.” “Honey, I am all for it but you are doing all these things by yourself. You are not accepting help from Sherry and you are ignoring Cassie and Zac. I know you see the bigger picture but you also need to focus on the problems right in front of you as well. We have situations here. that need addressed too.” noveldrama

I knew he was right but dam n if I was going to tell him that. “Fine but we are still having prom.” I said stubbornly. My stomach did a little fl*p and my mind went to the very se xy dress I had bought for the occasion. M “Well, since it is Monday and you have it scheduled for this Saturday, that is okay.” Colt laughed. He let me go and started walking away. “Where are you going?” I asked as I sat down. “I wanted to see how Ice was doing at her first day back at work. We just finished up on training

session on the new warriors. I gave them a few hours as a break before we kept going. Figured I would see how she was doing and then come back and do some more training. We are figuring out what their strengths and weaknesses are.” Colt yelled as he grabbed his keys and wallet. “How is that coming along?” I asked as I pulled out a blank sheet of paper. “I didn’t have any real expectations so it’s going good, I guess. Zac will start tomorrow so we shall see how that is. I know the guys are anxious to get their hands on him.” “And you?” I asked looked up as he walked back up to me. “Very.” Colt leaned down and k*ssed me gently. His hand slid and my face as he pulled me up just a little. “Can you take these to Kris?” I asked when he let me go. Reach down, I pulled out a sealed envelopel “Sure, what is it?” Colt took it and put it in his wallet. “Information. Dates of everything I have scheduled and what I need from her.” I waved him off and picked up a pencil. “I have Jacob and Sherry coming by in thirty minutes to check on you and to hang up these pictures. It wouldn’t be the worst thing if your have a list for Sherry too.” Colt looked at me as his hand wrapped. around the door handle. “Already on it.” I said as I held up my paper. 213 Colt winked at me and walked out the door. Only five minutes had passed and there was a knock on our office door.







###Chapter 296
Chapter 0296 Since my desk was far enough away, I got up and walked over to the door to answer it. I knew Colt always locked it when I am lone so even yelling wouldn’t have worked. Jacob had a key so this was someone else. “Hello-?” I said confused as I looked into the eyes of Colt’s long time. ex-girlfriend, Kara. “I-is Alpha Colt here?” She asked looking behind me. “No, is there something I can help you with?” I asked but I didn’t move. Kara was someone that intimated me. She had Colt’s heart for years. He has told me countless times that he never saw her as a Luna but that didn’t stop his heart from loving her. To her credit, she has never once overstepped and tried to be inappropriate with Colt.

“Can we talk for a moment?” Her eyes finally landed on mine. “Sure.” Stepping aside, Kara sl*pped in. Her b*dy language told me just how uncomfortable she was. As I walked to Colt’s desk, I sat down behind it and she took a seat in front. After an awkward pregnant pause, I asked, “What’s up?” “I have heard rumors that you are going to be making big changes. soon. With school out, I am unsure of what my future looks like. What I hoped for didn’t happen…” She looked down and twisted her hands. together. I honestly felt really sorry for her in this moment. It wasn’t sure fault what happened to her. However, it wasn’t my fault either. “I am going to be doing multiple things, yes.” I confirmed. Ignoring her comment was the only thing I could think of, that was not a topic I wanted to go into. “Can I ask if you have a job for me?” She looked up at me with ICOM, HVL CADOLIY Hoperame90 VI shame but acceptance? “A job?” I asked, confused. “Yeah. I am looking to find my purpose in life. Since you are making these changes, I was hoping I could be part of something.”

“I have to ask, this isn’t an attempt to win Colt back?” I was actually proud of myself for asking such a bolt question. “Oh no!” She looked horrified. “I won’t like and say that my heart. wasn’t shattered when you guys found out you were fated. I haven’t found my mate yet but I have moved on. I want to do something than stare at my bedroom walls. Part of me always wanted to be a teacher so if you have something that involved kids, I would request that.” I wasn’t sure what to say.. Sitting back in the chair, I just studied her. Giving her a chance to prove herself could be huge. If she fails, that could also have a large impact. However, she hasn’t given me a reason to not trust her as far as getting Colt back. The main part that helped me agree to this is the fact that Colt isn’t going to have anything to do with these project. Other than checking in randomly, he isn’t going to be focused on this. “For obvious reasons, I won’t be placing you in a leadership position but I will grant you your request. These programs are designed to help those kids who needs a direction or a purpose. I can’t very well turn away someone who is requesting that very same thing from me. Your can report directly to Mrs. Summers. She is the person seeing day by day activities for the kids. You can assist her in anything she needs. We can start there and see how it goes. Any and all promotions will be determined on your performance there. This will also help you. have the flexibility to do classes next month to get a degree in childhood development or whatever you feel is needed. A degree is required to hold any management position in these programs. That prvy! I km yumy rest of this month, you can help out the kitchen staff with any needs. I know they are struggling right now and need more hands.”noveldrama







###Chapter 297
Chapter 0297 Kara looked a little crest fallen but gathered herself quickly. “Thank you for this opportunity, Luna Penny.” I wasn’t sure why I felt so sh itty in that moment but I did. “I don’t have any ill feelings towards you. I know you have never tried to be inappropriate to Colt since we mated and I holding out hope that isn’t going to change. I acknowledge that you got your heart broke and for that I am terribly sorry. Colt is my mate and I won’t apologize for that but I do hope you will find some peace.” “Me too.” Kara stood up. “May I be excused?” “Yes. I will let the kitchen staff know that you will report to them tomorrow morning.” Kara nodded and walked to the door. Her entire b*dy was shaking as her hands barely wrapped around the handle before the door opened first. Jacob almost hit her as he took a step in but stopped just in time. “Kara?” He looked confused at her before looking at me. “Beta Jacob.” She said in restraint before she ran passed him. Jacob and Sherry walked in, looking confused at a retreating and now crying Kara.

“What was that about?” Jacob asked as he took a seat. One thing I loved about Jacob is how relaxed he is in private. Never once made me feel like I wasn’t ever part of their group. “She asked for a job.” I said. “A job?” Sherry asked as she sat down next to Jacob. “Yeah. Said she was ready to get out of her bedroom and wanted to be productive again. She said she heard rumors I was doing some mujor nunyou want to populi yuuuu. “She did want to be a teacher I think at some point.” Jacob looked like he was trying to see in the back of his head. “So she said.” “Did you give her one?” Sherry asked. noveldrama

“I did. Mrs. Summers is heading the Development and Rehabilitation Center. I told her to report to her and can assist Mrs. Summers in whatever she needed. Till then, I told her to help out with the kitchen.” “It is complete chaos down there.” Sherry agreed. “It is, that is why I am giving it to you.” I said and smiled at Sherry. “W-what?” Sherry looked shocked and scared. Jacob had a slow smile spread across his face. “Yeah, I am completely swamped and I could really use some help. The kitchen needs someone to be in charge of it. We need to bring back the monthly schedule of meals. Plan the food per event we have going on and over see day to day activities like grocery shopping and storage needs.” you want me to do that?” Sherry’s eyes were wide as she pointed to herself but was looking at me like I was st upid. “Yes, please. You have been adapting great and I think giving you some responsibilities is appropriate. As good as I am, I do need some I help. Since you are technically my beta, I would like you to take this over.” “By myself?” Sherry’s jaw was on the floor. “I mean, I will still be here for any questions and obviously Jacob and Colt are around. The kitchen ladies have been there since I was born, my advice, listen to what they want to see happen. You just have the








###Chapter 298
Chapter 0298 “Yes. I think you will be amazing at it.” I smiled at her. “How about I help you organize some things while Jacob puts up my pictures?” The relief on her face was clear. “Thank you.” Jacob smiled at me as he got up. “I put pensil marks on the walls where I want each one to be.” I said to him. He nodded and got to work. “Let’s go to my desk.” I said and took Colt’s chair with me. “Sit here beside me.” Sherry sat down as I pulled out my laptop. I had a desk top but for some reason, I loved my laptop for my creative needs. “I don’t even

know where to start…” “Let’s start here.” Pulling up excel, I designed a quick rectangle with seven sections. There was a line for breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. After coping and pasting it, I had quickly designed a large calender. Hitting print, I grabbed a three ring binder that was empty and a pen.. As soon as it was done printing, I put it in front of Sherry. “Fancy.” She muttered. “It was quick. Anyway, you can style this however but this does seem to work for the school cafeteria.” Sherry nodded. “Now, each food option would be listed. I’ll use this first one as an example. Breakfast can be pancakes with assorted fruits. Lunch is ham, chicken or roast beef sandwiches, salads, fruits and chips. Dinner can be Lasagna with garlic bread. Chocolate cake for desert. As a universal option, milk, water and tea will be served. If they want something else, they can bring it in.” “That seems easy enough.” Sherry had her eyebrows crunched together. “It isn’t too hard. For the next day, lunch could be an option of hot ham and cheese with any leftover ham or an open beef face sandwich.” “I see what you did there. You took the left over ham and put it in a grill cheese and used the roast beefnoveldrama

as another type of sandwich. So, any left over chicken can be used for shredded chicken tacos or something.” Sherry looked excited. “Exactly. I would save things like cold cut sandwiches for the day before a major event. That way the staff isn’t working on making two big things at once. Only desert for dinner time but you could have cookies made and available to those who want something sweet. Honestly, for breakfast, you can have a hot option but then always have muf fins, instant oatmeal, fruit and yogurt as options. Like I said, talk to the staff and see what they want too. You have the final say but I would listen to their request since they are the one doing the work and have been for decades.” “This doesn’t seem so hard.” Sherry was taking it all in. “It is only as hard as you make it be. Now, you will need to have someone make a grocery list. I believe they do a lot of ordering and having it delivered. Alec has farming land and will be growing their own produce. I would suggest reaching out to Luna Kristen to purchase from them. Also, we have some events coming up. You will need to sit down and create a gourmet menu for those events. There is Prom, my luna ceremony and I am doing an event over Halloween for all the packs to come together around the world. We will have thousands of people here and need to have enough food. Those will be a separate meeting though. For the rest of this week, I want you to create a menu for the rest of this month and next month. Organize the kitchen and assign everyone jobs so the chaos is gone.” TL “This week?”







###Chapter 299
Chapter 0299 “That’s not a lot of time.” Sherry looked stressed. “I think you will be surprised what the kitchen staff wants to see happen. Things have a way of falling into place and working themselves out. Go to the kitchen, as for Ms. Lucy and tell her you are there to address the kitchen organization. Ask her when the best time to have a meeting is and schedule it then. You have your mind-link. Send out a massive mind-link to all kitchen staff that they need to be present for the meeting.” “Ms. Lucy is nice.” Sherry said more to herself than anyone. “She is. She has snuck me more food than I could ever have wanted growing up.” I laughed. “I do believe you need your own laptop. though. Use Jacob’s card and get one. Once you get this going, it will be minimal effort. I can start giving your more and more.” “How do you do all this?” Sherry’s eyes got wide. “Honestly, I have done it so long that I have built up contacts and I have themes. Look.” I hit a folding and pulled up a sub-folder that said themes. In it was pictures of different decor and items I knew we had in storage. “We have most of this in the basement. I have bought stuff as things came up. Treating it nicely, I have been able to reuse most of it.” Clicking a different folding, it pulled up a list of names. These are my contacts per whatever I need. If I need lights, I call Sam. He is my light guy and so forth.”

“Nice.” “Exactly, so when we have something come up, I called them up and tell them what I am thinking and he will email me over the details and I will either agree or make changes and that’s it. Simple and easy.” “You can plan a whole party in a day.” Sherry was looking at it all. “Yes I can. Been doing it for Kris for years and now I get to do it for the whole pack.” “Okay. I will do my best.” Sherry had a look of determination as she grabbed her stuff and walked out of the office without saying a word noveldrama

to Jacob. “I’ve never seen her like this.” Jacob looked confused as he watched the door shut behind her. “I hope it helps her become more involved.” “Did Colt ask you to do this?” Jacob asked as he finished hanging the last nail. “Yes and no. I mean, he brought it up today. I have been a little stressed out and needed the push to delegate. I was waiting till she asked me for work. I assumed she would come to me when she was ready. Colt thought she needed to push.” “I know she is timided to help out. You know how those women were treated. This might be good for her. It’s not like she can fail at this. This will boost her confidence up. Hopefully, really make her relax finally.” “I think she has made great improvements.” I said as I set up an email address for Sherry. Writing it down on a sticky note, I placed it on my desk. “I do too. She is completely different than before. It has helped those ba stards are dead.” There was still an anger to Jacob. There was another knock on the office door. Jacob immediately put his hammer down and walked to the door to answer it. “Is, Luna Penny here? I have an urgent matter?” Jacob looked over and me. I nodded yes and he stepped back. “I’m over here.” I said as I watched a nurse walk in. I immediately knew where this was going. “I am so sorry to bother you. Alpha Colt has not told us where Cassie and Zac need to be moved to and they are standing at the hospital doors. We can’t release them until there is a place for them to go. Per Alpha Colt, they are to be watched at all ti-” I held up my hand knowing exactly what he ordered.







###Chapter 300

﻿noveldrama

"It's okay. They can go to room..." I paused not sure where to put them. There was only two rooms available. One was on the alpha floor and that wasn't happening at this moment so I guess they were going across the packhouse. "Room 2002. Any accommodations that are medically needed, let me know but you have my permission to do whatever you need."

"Thank you, we will get them moved within the hour." I handed her a key to the room and she left.

"I think I'm all finished" Jacob said as soon as the nurse left.

"Okay." Looking around, he had everything level and I was in awe at how good she was. "She really was amazing."

"Colt might not say it but this was really special to him. I'm glad you did this." Jacob wasn't looking at me but at the wolf head behind his desk.

"Her absence really cost them and this pack. I hope I can be the Luna she would have been."

"My dad said she was amazing. I think the centers you are doing would be right up her alley. I think she would be very proud of you." My eyes filled with tears. It might be the pregnancy but that was the best compliment I could have asked for.

"Thank you."

"What are your plans now?" Jacob said, thankfully changing the subject.

"Give it some time and then see Cassie." Sighing, I sat down. We haven't told anyone I was pregnant. Right now, I was doing good but I just had this need to sit down.

"Do you want me to go with you?" Jacob asked. I could feel the protective nature coming through. It really wasn't a bad idea but I needed to not use someone as a crutch. I wanted to be like Kris and be able to handle my own. She had been my role model for years and now I felt like we were equals. I wanted to make her proud of who I became or is becoming.

"I think I want to do it alone but I'll call if I need some support but thank you."

"Of course. This isn't a little thing."

"I'm just not sure how to handle this." I said, honestly.

"This isn't a right way to handle this." The caught be by surprise. Looking at him, I just listened. "Like honestly. You can do whatever and it would be appropriate. You could yell, throw a few punches or just talk. However, I want to be there if you punch Zac. That needed recorded."

Leave it to Jacob to make a joke. He wasn't exactly Beta material. He had been a perfect gamma but he needed to be more serious to be a Beta. Colt still worried about the pack if something was to happen to us and it was up to Jacob. However, his dad's will would come into play also. Giving it to Kristen until our baby was old enough to run it.

"I doubt that will be how I handle it. If I wanted to punch him, I would probably come to training." Truthfully, if I ever did, it would be planned. It would be in the heat of the moment since I am not a fighter.

"Still, I'll be around. I'm going to go check on Sherry. Let me know if you need me." Jacob nodded as he walked out.

Opening my internet browser, I pulled up a baby store. We had the crib from Colt but I wanted a different theme. Plus, we needed bottles and everything else. Emmy's baby shower was this afternoon and I hadn't wrapped our present to her yet.

I really liked the floral theme Kristen had in her nursery. However, all the pink is too much. I prefer something a little different. Though, I'm sure that was the style 18 years ago. If we have a boy, I am going to do an outdoor theme. With wolves and all the forest animals. There was the cutest wolf pacifier clips. Most of everything came in either pink, blue, green or white. Choosing the green options, it would go with either one. After picking out a style of blanket that matched each theme, I saw an hour had passed and I needed to get moving if I wanted to visit Cassie before going upstairs to change. Closing my computer, I got up and walked up to our room.







###Chapter 301
Chapter 0301 “What does one wear to a baby shower?” I whispered out loud to myself. A guess a sundress would be good. I wasn’t sure if it was outside or not but this would be a safe choice. I knew she was in her second trimester but werewolf pregnancies were different. Kristen had alpha blood so hers would be quicker. However, I was an alpha with Colt so that made me worried I would have an even faster pregnancy. “There you are!” The bedroom door opened and Colt came in. He was all smiles as he came up to me and k*ssed my cheek. “Trying to decide what to wear.” I said. “I’m surprised you are back to early.” “Ice was just actually on her way out. She had some stuff to finish for Emmy’s shower so she only worked in the morning.” “How was she doing?” Grabbing a floral blue and white dress, I sl*pped it on before going to the vanity to fix my makeup.

“Real good. She hasn’t had any negative symptoms. Just craving pickles.” “So there is hope I won’t be an emotional wreck like Emmy was.” I laughed. “She was a mess.” Colt agreed as he pulled out khaki shorts and a teal polo. “I was going to see Cassie before we left.” I glanced at him in the mirror. He was pulling up his shorts when he froze for a second and looked at me through the mirror. “Okay.” He said simply. ago.” Finishing my l*p gloss, I grabbed the bobby pillow and covers and put them in the bag. “What room did you decide?” “2002.” Since they weren’t finding out the gender, the bobby pillow was grey with white stars. The covers other covers were mountains or forest animals. The tissue paper was white that went with the white bag with different colored baby items. I finished signing our names on the card before Colt spoke again.

“Jacob and Sherry are going to ride with us. “Might as well. No reason for us to drive separate.” Colt put on his shoes and grabbed the bag. “How are you feeling?” He asked as he opened the door. “Same. Just feel like I need to sit but otherwise I’m good.” Walking out, Colt closed the door and locked it before heading down. “We will need to find a time to tell everyone.” Colt said as he took my hand. “Prom is this weekend. Let’s tell everyone there.” “Why then?” Colt asked. We were going down the stairs and I didn’t want to be overheard to I switched to the mind-link. “Everyone will be there and we aren’t stepping on anyone’s toes this way.” Reaching the bottom, Colt placed the bag by the door and we made. our way to the other side to Cassie’s room. “If that is what you want.” Colt’s demeanor changed as we got up to Cassie’s door. He was in his Alpha mode and protective stance behind me. Raising my hand, I paused in mid air for a second before three weak 2/3 “Alpha Colt, Luna Penny.” The nurse bowed as she stepped back and allowed us to come in. Zac was standing in the corner and Cassie was getting her bandages changed. “Oh, hello!” Cassie said weakly and glanced at herself.noveldrama







###Chapter 302
Chapter 0302 “I… we came to see how things were going.” Walking in, the nurse shut the door and resumed changing the bandages. Cassie’s front was covered but her back was fully exposed. This was the first time I saw just how bruised and frail her b*dy was. “Thank you for coming.” Cassie winced from whatever the nurse applied. “How are you feeling?” I asked. I was vaguely aware of the lack of emotion in my voice. My heart was only calm because Colt kept shoving relaxing emotions into me. “Much better. The doctor has me on a 800 calorie diet. Next week, we will move up to 1200 calories. He said a little at a time so my stomach can handle it. I can tell I am improving each day.” The nurse finished wrapping some spots before pulling down her night gown. Helping her turn and lay down, she covered Cassie up with the blankets and went to clean up. The room was smaller but still bigger and more comfortable than the hospital room. The bed on off to the right with a small seating areal on the left. The bathroom was next to the walk-in closet. The bed was

still a king size so there was plenty of room for them to sleep comfortably. “I would like to get you so clothes and other items. If you want to make a list of what you want or need, I can get them. The bathroom is filled with men and women’s things that are your’s to use.” The whole thing felt awkward. I wasn’t sure what to say and they kept just looking at me. “The nurse told me I should be able to start walking around and maybe eat in the cafeteria this week.” Cassie smiled at me. 1/5 “That would be good improvement.” agreed. “Any exercise you get will be good. Laying in bed all day isn’t good but you shouldn’t over do it either. The physical wounds are about healed. Now it is about getting your b*dy healthy again.” The nurse gave her a pointed look before taking her gloves off and washing her hands in the bathroom.

“Zac is starting training tomorrow so I figured I would try to walk to the porch maybe and get some fresh air.” Cassie smiled at Zac. “I think that will be a fine idea.” Zac didn’t move but gave her a small smile. “Well, we are off to an event. I just wanted to drop by and make sure you were situated.” I said, ready to leave. “I will make a list tonight of my sizes anything else I may need. It shouldn’t be much.” Cassie said. “The same goes for you, Zac. Anything you need and you will need more clothes. Write down your sizes as well.” I said firmly. I swear he was wearing the same clothes he was wearing a week ago. He didn’t answer but nodded at me. I’m sure it was his pride getting the way. “Thank you for coming by. Maybe I will get to see you thi week while I am walking around.” Cassie smiled at me. “Maybe.” I said and turned to leave. Colt opened the door for me before I ran into it. I didn’t stop walking when I heard the door close. “Penny.” Colt had to take a few steps to catch me before grabbing my arm. My b*dy instantly turned and folded into his. “It’s okay.” “I don’t know why I can’t handle this.” I small s ob broke through me. Not enough to make me break down but just enough to get it out. “You are handling this great.” Colt whispered. His arms were wrapped “Me ntally, I know they didn’t abandon me.” “For your entire life you believed they did. You can’t take back 19 years worth of anguish in two weeks.” “Kristen would.” “You’re not Kristen.” Colt pulled me back. “Penny, Kristen isn’t as put together as you think. She was emotionally torn down and An n hitting her everyday….she was far from put together. Outwardly she appeared to not be bothered but she was a mess inside. Trust me. You can’t compare apples to oranges.”noveldrama







###Chapter 303
Chapter 0303 “Are…” Jacob came around the corner and realized he interrupted us. “We are ready.” I said and turned to walk away. Colt frowned as he didn’t like that answer but didn’t argue with me. “O-okay…” Jacob looked questionly at Colt that I just ignored before walking to pick us our present. Sherry must have seen the whole thing because she didn’t ask. Instead, she just got their present and walked out in front of me to Colt’s car. Popping the trunk, we put our gifts in before closing it and getting in. Colt got there just as I slid in so he shut my door and walked around. I knew he wasn’t happy with how that ended up that was okay with me. “Sherry, how did the meeting go?” I asked. “We will have it tomorrow but I sat down with the head of the kitchen.” She put air quotes around head. Colt started the engine and started driving. “What did they say?” “They wanted to start up the monthly menu again so that was a great idea. They had a few different recipes they wanted to put it. Really, they set the menu and I was just kind of there.” She almost seemed annoyed by this. noveldrama

“So it was productive.” I concluded. “Yeah, it is amazing how things just get themselves done if you just ask for other opinion and they take off with it.” “Really makes things easier.” I agreed. Colt put his hand on my thigh and gave it a squeeze. He was frustrated but I knew he wasn’t not hold my hand. “Since that got addressed so quickly, maybe you are ready for another task?” Jacob put his arm around Sherry. “Like what?” She asked looking up at him. There was still some. hesitancy in there but more confidence than she had before. “What else would you like her to do, Penny?” Jacob asked me.

As much as I wanted her to take care of Cassie and Zac’s lists, I couldn’t put something that personal on her lap yet. “We are having that massive pack meeting on friday but we really need to ask Kris what she needs help with for prom on saturday. They are having it at the conference center that Alec built. I have a few more things but we can wait till after saturday to discuss them.” Mainly because she needed to know I was pregnant and we weren’t telling anyone yet. “Okay.” Sherry said, simply as we pulled up to Black Moon Pack. People were coming and going like normal but this time, there was a happiness in the hair. Almost a carefree atmosphere. I couldn’t help but smile as we got out. Colt sl*pped his arm around my waist, pulling me out of my funk when Alec came out of the packhouse. “Hey, man.” Colt said as he extended his hand. “How’s it going?” Alec gave a small smile like he always does and shook Colt’s hand before they went into for a bro hug. “Penny, you look beautiful.” He muttered before giving me a k*ss on the cheek. “Thank you.” I said and greeted him back. I was a little taken aback because he usually never greeted me before. However, we were in a state of war so it wasn’t like we were just hanging out like this. “Alec.” Jacob said with a big smile. “Colt! Penny!” I heard Kris yell as she came down the stairs. Alec UTIVUA JUVVU J TIULIU but ULI “Hello, Sherry” He said with a smile, “Hello, Alpha Alec.” She said back. I noticed her timid nature was back. “How are you feeling?” Colt asked Kris as they let each other go. “I told you earlier that I am good.” She just rolled her eyes at him and came over to me. “You look gorgeous in that dress!” “Thank you!” Kris was wearing a flowly sundress that was white with sunflowers on it. I swear she has wore that before but I couldn’t place. it. “I love that dress too.”







###Chapter 304
Chapter 0304 “It’s a dress.” Kris shrugged before moving on. “Jacob.” He scooped her up and twirled her once before sitting her down. I always glanced over at Alec when Jacob does that. There is a little annoyance on his face but I think he has come to accept it for what it is. However, I was surprised that Sherry hugged Kris back. Not that she had much of a choice but it was still nice to see. “Where is Emmy?” I asked. Kris’s b*dy tensed up a little. “Sssssshe will meet us at the party.” Alec looked up at the sky and gave a big sigh. “That doesn’t sound good.” Colt concluded. “Apparently, she wanted yellow balloons and there are purple ones.” Kris put her hands on her hips. “I would love to stay and talk abut I have to go fix whatever she is crying about now.” “Do you need some help?” I asked. noveldrama

“That would be amazing.” Kris smiled at me in relief. “Of course. Sherry and I will come see what we can do to help you. out.” Grabbing Sherry’s hand, I forced her to follow us. “I know these balloons are the real issue at hand but she is freaking out over being a mom in short.” Kris said as we made our way around the packhouse and to the back. A large white tent was up with lots of ballons and decoration. Some of the balloons were shaped like baby bottles or pacifiers and others were just basic balloons. What I liked the most was the massive balloons that were standing about seven feet in the air with a string of confetti holding them down. However, they were purple. “It is a scary thing.” Sherry said softly. We both heard the timidness in her voice but Kris was too knowing to call her out on it. Instead, she gave her a smile and nodded as we came up to the event. “Oh, Luna!” A pack member came up to her with pieces of hair sticking out in every direction. “We need you.”

“What happened?” Kris frowned. “She doesn’t like the cake! I had to take it away before she smashed it!” Tears filled the girl’s eyes. “S hit. Where is she?” “She is in the bathroom and we had to take down those center pieces and now I don’t know what to do!” “I can handle this is if you guys want to go handle her?” Sherry said to our surprise. Kris blinked a few times but recovered well. “That would be amazing. Just use your best judgement. I’m sure whatever you decide will be perfect.” I gave her a warm smile as we walked inside. Jasper was resting his head against the bathroom, looking completely exhausted. “Come on, just open the door or I’ll break it down!” “Jasper, why don’t you go find the men and we will handle her?” I said and pulled him away. If I was correct, Kris wasn’t going to wait for her to open it before she busted it down. Jasper didn’t even respond but tossed his hands in the air and walked. away. “I will give you three seconds and then I am breaking this door.” Kris said in a very authoritative way. The door flew open. Emmy was standing there in a beautiful yellow fitted dress. It was a higher neck line with no sleeves. The whole thing muyyou mer preynum uvury w THAT HIM and left it down but her make up was smudged from crying. “What is the problem?” Kris half yelled as we walked in. Closing the door behind me, Kris grabbed a rag and started cleaning Emmy’s face. “My dress doesn’t match anything now! I wanted yellow balloons and a yellow cake but it’s all purple!” I couldn’t contain my laughter. www 13







###Chapter 305
Chapter 0305 “You’re laughing at me?” Emmy glared at me and Kris looked at me like I was crazy. “Do you realize how this sounds?” I asked as I tried to stop laughing.” Two weeks ago, Kristen was kidnapped and almost died. Your f ucking mate almost died! He barely survived. The limp he is still sporting is proof of that and you are crying because the balloons are purple? How about being thankful that your mate is even here to see this!” I wasn’t sure why I got so mad but I was. Throwing the door open, I stormed out, slamming the door shut behind me. 1 My feet were moving on their own but I wasn’t exactly sure where I was going. The further I got away from Emmy, the more I became mortified about my actions.. “Penny?” I heard Colt yell at me. Looking over, all the guys were staring at me from across the foyer. “I “What’s wrong?” Colt asked. Jasper was looking up at the ceiling and the other guys were going back and forth. “I might have just yelled at Emmy…” said in a quiet voice. Completely shamed of my actions. noveldrama

“What?” Colt looked shocked. Jasper just started laughing. “What is going on?” Alec looked between us. “She is fl*pping out her dress doesn’t match the balloons and I might have fl*pped out on her that she had her priorities wrong. I might have also said that her mate about died two weeks ago and she should just be happy she is even having a party to celebrate this pregnancy “Welp, I guess you and I can get murdered together.” Jasper laughed. “No one is going to get killed.” Alec sighed. “I’m surprised you said that. You are usually very quiet and reserved.” Jacob narrowed his eyes at me. “F uck off.” I said and instantly slapped my hand over my mouth. My eyes were wide in complete shock that I would even say that, Colt’s mouth was open and Alec and Jasper were dying laughing. “What’s so funny out here?” Kris said. We all turned and looked at Krist pulling Emmy with her. When no one spoke, Kris shoved Emmy forward. “I want to apology. for my behavior. I’m ready to not

be pregnant anymore.” She was clearly ashamed by her actions but Jasper just found it funny as he pulled her into a hug. “We all are ready for you to not be pregnant anymore.” Kris said, not even trying to mask her true feelings. Instead, she shook her head, and folded her arms over her chest. “Shall we move on to the party? I think it is about time for it to start.” I said, wanting to not bring up what I spit out just a minute earlier. “That is a great idea.” Alec muttered and pushed Jacob and Colt. forward. Colt grabbed my waist and pulled me along side of him as we all walked back outside. “There is nothing wrong with you. I found that quite funny.” He said in our mind-link. “So I am getting bit chy? At least I’m not crying.” I said as the sun blinded us until we made it under the tent. It was already filling up with people. Drinks were being passed around with different snack. items. “Help yourself to any food or drinks!” Kris yelled as she wondered off to talk to different pack members. My stomach rumbled right now cue as my eyes landed on Sherry. She was finished putting up some. flowers. “You did a great job!” I said to her as I got closer. “Thank you. “S-sherry?” A woman walked up to her. She looked very similar to Sherry to the point that I wondered if they were sisters. When Sherry. didn’t respond, I looked at her. Sherry’s mouth was wide open. Her hands were trembling but her whole b*dy was frozen. “What’s going on?” I heard Jacob come up behind us. “I’m sorry, who are you?” I asked, quietly. “I am her sister.” The woman was smiling at Sherry but Sherry looked completely terrified.









###Chapter 306
Chapter 0306 “Jacob, let’s move this to Alec’s office.” I said instantly. He was no longer in a playful mood. This was the beta that Colt wanted to see. “Walk.” He said firmly to the woman. She nodded and made her way. Turning, I saw this little exchange was completely missed by everyone. Quietly, I walked up behind Alec and tapped him on the shoulder. Kris was busy talking to someone else on the far side of the tent and Colt was getting food. “Yeah?” Alec asked as he turned and looked at me. “Follow me.” I said extremely quietly and turned to walk away. We were able to sl*p off without being noticed by anyone. Jasper was caught up helping Emmy with something. “What is going on?” Alec asked as soon as we were out of view from the party. “I don’t really know. We need to get to your office though.” I said and increased my steps. Thankfully, his office wasn’t far away and the door was open. “The f uck?” Alec seemed rather annoyed at this. As soon as he walked through, I could feel his aura out a little. “What is this?” Jacob was holding back Sherry. She looked terrified and angry. The woman on the far side of the wall was laughing. “After all these years.” She said. “Apparently, they are sisters.” I said to Alec.

His b*dy froze as he looked between them. “Shut the door.” He told me and walked between them. Doing as I was told, I shut the door and walked up next to Sherry.” 113 பா� “Tell them, little Sher.” The women shrugged and folded her arms. Expect nothing came out of Sherry. “Cat got your tongue?” “Enough!” Alec said dangerously calm. “Tell me what is going on here.” He commanded her. “I am Sherry’s big sister. Tanya.” She said. noveldrama

“No…” Jacob said as his own eyes got dark. “She told you about me?” She looked flattered. “She should be thanking me, I helped her survive that place!” “Survive? You allowed me to be taken as payment! I was raped by countless men to pay off your debt!” My jaw dropped as I heard this. Sherry hasn’t told anyone her story. By Jacob’s reaction, she told him some. “I did what we needed to survive! If I didn’t allow it, it would have only been worse.” Tanya narrowed her eyes at Sherry. “You f ucking told your mate to rape me and then got off on watching it happen!” Sherry was full hysterics by then. It was like a light bulb. switch went off in her head. Sherry stopped crying and stood up. Jacob was still holding her back but a look crossed her face. “Where is Gunther?” A sly smile crossed Tanya’s face. “I don’t know.” “Who is Gunther?” Alec asked in forced restraint. “Our brother, the gam ma.” Sherry said. “Your brother was the ga mma?” Alec asked Sherry with black eyes. “Yes. Tanya’s mate was his best friend. His name was Vin. They were in charge of the warriors. If anyone needed disciplined, they would handle it unless Rip was feeling bored. Tanya allowed it all to happen. Alec walked up to Tanya and pulled her shirt down. Her mark was still very much present, telling us her mate was still around. “Where is your mate?” He asked. “I honestly don’t know. Him and Gunther got out before you raided the building.” “What are their plans?” Alec asked. “To get revenge.” Tanya said with her hand held high. My heart sank at this. “What?” “That’s right. Penny is it? I believe you took something they want. back.” Tanya looked at me and snickered.

“Alec, can we put her in a holding cell for now. Jacob, why don’t you take a moment here with Sherry and collect yourselves before coming down to the party. Nothing else is going to ruin this day. We will address this later tonight.” Alec didn’t have to wait but a second before his door was opened by three huge men. “Put her in holding cell five.”







###Chapter 307
Chapter 0307 “Five?” The warrior asked surprised. “Yes.” Alec shoved her to them. She went willing and laughed the whole way. As soon as she was out of the office, I waited just a hair longer to make sur she was gone before talking again. “Jacob, I shouldn’t need. to tell you to keep your mouth shut about this for now.” Sherry’s face was buried in his chest. He looked ready to kill but kept his composure. “Yeah.” He said. Nodding, we walked out of the office and closed the door. “Penny…” Alec said but I didn’t want to hear it. Instead, I just kept walking. He followed me the whole way out to the party. Kris and Colt both narrowed their eyes when we approached but otherwise I think we went unnoticed. Their twin features really came out in these times. “What is going on?” Colt asked in our mind-link. I had walked up to him and sat down on his lap, laying my head against his neck for comfort. “I’ll tell you later.” After a few breaths, I sat up and watched Emmy finish opening her gifts. Kris’s and Alec’s eyes kept darting to each. other and I knew they were having a conversation. Colt didn’t push but kept rubbing my back, keeping me calm. N noveldrama

My b*dy was on auto pilot as Emmy cut the cake and it started getting passed around. Colt tried to get me to eat something but I just pushed it away. We just got happy and now it’s not over. This time, babies are involved now and stakes are higher. Sherry never returned to the party. Only when everything started winding down did Emmy yawn. “Let’s get your upstairs and take a nap.” Jasper said and helped her stand. “This is my nap time. Ask Ice. I am unbearable if I don’t get my nap. She joked. “Yeah, that is the only time.” Kris rolled her eyes but smiled at her. Jasper, please come see me when

you are finished putting her down. We need some help picking up.” Jasper narrowed his eyes at her but Emmy didn’t seem to noticed. Okay.” As soon as they were out of sight, Kristen turned on us. “What is going on?” She asked us. Alec looked at me and folded his arms. “Not here.” I said and tried to stand up. “Penny, what happened?” Colt gently turned my head to face him. I couldn’t stop the tears that wanted to fill them but I also got mad. “No!” Ripping myself out of his grasp, I stood up and collected myself. “I said not here.” Looking around, there was pack members cleaning up. “Let’s go up to my office.” Alec said and stood up. “But..” Kris started. “Office, Kristen.” Alec said and gave her a look. She instantly shut her mouth and looked at me worriedly. “Okay.” They took off, not holding hands but he didn’t even try. Colt didn’t try to hold my hand either but I think I am too worked up right now. So many things are going through me; fear, anxiety, sorrow, guilt. I wasn’t even sure how to tell them all what Sherry had told us. Everyone was quiet as we walked in. Jacob and Sherry were still sitting on the couch. Her face was red and spotchy like she had been Juny une mivic Ge, NJ D QUILTLULI mode switched on. ma upių “The f uck is going on, Jacob?” He asked as he examined Sherry. “You need to tell them.” Jacob’s eyes were black but he talked calmly to Sherry. “I-I can’t.” She said barely above a whisper.

“We don’t have a choice. We kept your secrets because they didn’t have am impact on the situation but now it does. Now you have to tell them what you told me.” Sherry looked at me for help. “Someone better start talking.” Kristen said getting annoyed. “This isn’t over.” I said as I looked at Colt.







###Chapter 308
Chapter 0308 “What’s not over?” Colt asked. “The war.” I said and didn’t break eye contact. “Yes it is, I killed them. I-I ripped out Darin’s heart with my own hand! Sierra killed Rip.” Kristen sounded like she was controlling her anxiety but it was clearly across her face. Alec just looked at her. Colt was looking between us and back at Sherry. “Explain. “Alec has a pack member. Her name is Tanya.” I started and looked at Sherry. She didn’t say anything but looked at me as more silent tears ran down her face. “Tanya is Sherry’s older sister. From what we gathered, Tanya is mated to Vin. Tanya and Sherry have an older brother, Gunther. Gunther was the gam ma. According to Tanya, Vin and Gunther were able to escape before you attacked the building. Now they want revenge.” “On who?” Colt asked after a moment. “She said I took something from them and they want it back. I don’t know if it was the title of Alpha or if they hold me responsible for their death. Either way, she looked at me and said I took something from them and they want it back.” “She is in my holding cells, waiting for your instructions.” Alec said, finally taking his eyes off Kristen and looking at Colt.

Colt just blinked and looked at me. His eyes shifted to Sherry and back at me before looking over at Kristen. Her eyes were looking down as she appeared to be wrestling with something internally. Colt closed his eyes and roared before punching the wall. No one even flinched or tried to stop him. The sounds that were coming out. vim uyyou any incur DUL life. JUUL TUIL TUTTU. “I want to talk to her.” He said finally.

“Whenever you are ready.” Alec said simply. “I am going too.” I said with more conviction than I expected. “You are f ucking not!” Colt turned at me and yelled. He has never raised his voice to me. I was a little taken aback but mainly I was getting pis sed off. “Whoa!” Kristen stepped in front of me. “I am f ucking going too, Colt! This is my life and if it is in danger than want to know!” I yelled from behind Kristen. “You are f ucking pregnant! This isn’t just your life anymore!” He yelled back. The room felt like all the air got sucked out of it. Colt instantly knew he f ucked up and closed his eyes as he gathered himself. “You’re pregnant?” Kris turned and looked at me. “This wasn’t how we were going to tell you guys.” I said simply. My shoulders just shrugged but I was disappointed this is how it went. “I’m so happy for you. How far along?” Kris pulled me into a hug. “I think we are about the same. I found out yesterday.” No one else spoke as they were processing all this. “A-alpha.” Sherry said and stood up. Colt didn’t respond but looked at her. “Tanya would give me up for payment. She is not an abused girl like the rest. of us were. She was always whispering in Vin’s ear. Staying behind the scenes. She isn’t innocent. I was never involved and I honestly don’t know any information. I would be cleaning the floors and Tanyal would come home and yell at Vin that isn’t what she wanted him to do. As soon as she saw me, I would get hit and send away. I honestly Colt just tossed open the door and walked out. “Kris, I’m coming.” I said to her, hoping she was on my side. She looked at Alec. “You have to stay in the observation room.” She gave me a pointed look. “Okay.” I said. She grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the office. with Alec right behind us. Jasper caught us as we were leaving. Looking confused, he saw Alpha’s expression and didn’t question it. Jacob came out and shut the office door before he started following

us too. noveldrama








###Chapter 309
Chapter 0309 I hadn’t ever been to the cells so I wasn’t sure what I was expecting but this wasn’t it. The first thing that hits you is the smell. Sweat that had been sitting in one spot without any airflow lingered. As soon as it hit your nasal passage, your eyes instantly watered and I almost started choking. Then came the blood and dirt that added more flavor to the mix. Once we started passing the cells, that is what it got really bad. The sight of his prisoners either chained to the wall or they had their hands sticking out, begging for help. “Don’t look, just keep walking.” Kristen whispered as she pulled me quickly down the hallway. Colt was yelling at the guards to get Tanya out of the cells when Kristen pushed me into a room. The smell instantly died down but it was still there. The room was pitch black. My eyes tried to make out something but it wasn’t until a light fl*pped on that I could see. A large glass window sat to my right The men I had grew up with were struggling to get a single female into a chair and chain her down. She was biting, kicking and throwing punches. After one solid hit from Colt, her fighting died down. Jasper and Jacob stood by the door while Alec and Colt took off their shirts. “Why are they taking their shirts off?” I asked. “So they don’t get blood on them.” Kristen said. She hit a button and our room was filled with their voices. My stomach rolled over. “You are going to answer every single question we have.” Alec commanded. He looked absolutely deadly. “Do I?” Tanya looked at him. “From my point of view, I was not present when you swore everyone in so I’m not technically a pack

member.” Colt didn’t even hesitate as he pulled back and punched her in the mouth. “I want to f ucking know what your mate is up to.” I could feel the anger coming from him. “I just know they got out of the building before Alpha Rip died. S tupid. b itch.” Tanya looked down and

pit a w ad of blood out. I glanced over at Kristen, she didn’t even flinch. “From my point of view, Rip really f ucked things up. He couldn’t even find the one person. that was f ucking up his plans. What a s hitty alpha to follow.” Alec gloated. “He was twice the alpha you were.” Tanya spit. “Sounds pretty protective over him. Did you sleep with him too?” Colt asked. “I did what I needed to do to get Vin where he wanted to be.” Tanya’s face turned. “Vin is an honorable man!” Colt immediately held up a finger to Jacob who took a step forward Stopping Jacob in his tracks, Colt walked forward. “An honorable man f ucks girls that aren’t his mate? He raped your sister and you think that is honorable?” “She is nothing but business. Surprised that brat even lived through half the s hit. Oh well, it was better for me.” SLAP! Colt back handed her so hard that I heard her neck cr ac k a few times. “What position did Gunther want? He was already ga mma?” Alec asked. He hasn’t even moved from his spot. “That isn’t my story to tell.” Tanya laughed. “I was surprised to see Sherry though. I will say that.” “What do you mean?” Alec asked. “I sent her a payment to a few guys awhile go. They went to some pany una voLTIG yuja “That was the night Jacob found her.” I whispered. “Your birthday party. Did Colt and Alec kill those men?” Looking over at Kristen, she just frowned. “She found her mate that night.” Colt told her, mirroring my thoughts. “Who would want someone so used up?” Colt didn’t even stop Jacob from advancing forward and landing at few punches to her. He only pulled him off when he landed one on her temple. “We need her alive.” Colt said as he pulled him back. Alec

walked over and took Jacob by the throat and flattened him against the wall. Jasper wasn’t healed enough to have the power to hold Jacob back right now and Colt was doing the interrogation. 31 noveldrama







###Chapter 310
Chapter 0310 “What does Penny have to do with it?” Colt asked when Tanya picked her head up. “Everything. An eye for an eye.” Tanya said before she passed out. Her chest was still moving so I knew he wasn’t dead but the feeling of dread sank in. Different guards came into the room as Colt grabbed his and Alec’s shirts. Alec walked behind Jacob and Jasper held the door for us as Colt was walking behind Alec. He was irate. “Are you okay?” Kristen asked me when we came out from the cells. Everyone stopped and stood in a circle. “An eye for an eye? It sounds like they believe Sherry was dead so this really is about me?” “Sounds like someone did something they shouldn’t have and now their past is coming up to get them.” Jasper said. “What do you mean?” Colt asked. “Zac?” noveldrama

“Exactly. What did Zac do to help keep his daughter alive that is making Gunther and Vin want to kill her?” Jasper looked at me and frowned. “Kristen, keep her here.” Colt said and slapped Alec on the chest. He walked off and after a look to Kristen, Alec followed him. I opened my mouth to speak but nothing came out. Instead, I just pushed all my hurt into him as he kept on walking. He was too angry to do anything about it. “Come on. Let’s go inside.” Kristen threaded her arm through mine. “Why can I not question him? He is my father!” I said angerly. “Because you are carrying his baby and that changes everything. What if you accidentally got pushed down or something and miscarried?” Jasper chimed in.

“Do you realize how stu pid you sound? Got pushed down? A guy can ram his penis into our vaginas and not hurt the baby over and over again but oh, let’s be scared I might trip!” Kristen died laughing and the guys just shook their heads. “I love pregnant Penny.” “Well, seriously! Do you not realize the thing, you bottom out on his the baby’s head?” My frustration was coming out and Jasper and Jacob looked at me like I grew three heads. “What?” Jacob blinked a few times. “Please tell me I don’t have to teach you basic female anatomy?” “Oh!” Kristen was trying to catch her breath. “Please do!” “Probably have to draw a f ucking diagram.” I muttered as I kept walking. “Pregnant Penny is mean.” Jasper mocked as I passed. Fl*pping him off to his delight, I just kept walking. I wasn’t sure. I exactly where I was going but I was just walking. I wanted to know what Zac did that is causing Vin and Gunther to come after me. Somehow, I found myself back at Kristen and Alec’s office. Sherry was just sitting there, almost sleep when we walked in. I plopped myself down in an arm chair. Jacob sat by Sherry and Jasper sat by me. Kristen walked to Alec’s chair and sat down. “There hasn’t actually been any threat on my life. It’s been two weeks and nothing has happened.” “They literally lost everything. It will take time to build it back up to attack Two guys can’t just walk in to a pack and kill someone” Jasper shorted “Why not? Sounds like Tanya did “I said, my face was completely stoic “What?” Jasper looked at me “Did you not hear her? She wasn’t present for the meeting. She wasn’t present when Jacob and Sherry were introduced when we flattened the packhouse. My guess, she wasn’t present when we moved everyone. Hell, she might not even be on the list of who is going where I will bet you anything that she sl*pped in to see how far she could have gotten







###Chapter 311
Chapter 0311 Colt POV My blood was f ucking boiling. We just f ucking buried our dead, buried my father, opened Kristen’s shop, f uck, the club is due to open friday! Kristen is pregnant! Emmy is pregnant and she almost lost Jasper. Penny is now pregnant with my f ucking child and now her life is in danger? My foot stayed on the gas the entire way to the packhouse. I didn’t even think twice about leaving the pack today. This whole f ucking thing has me sick t o my stomach. How Alec managed to reign in his temper was confusing the hell out of me right now. Kristen is my sister and I was pis s ed but Penny is my mate and that is completely different. “We don’t even know if this was true. Let’s talk to Zac, get some clarity and make a plan. There is only two of them.” Alec was trying to talk reasonable but I wasn’t capable of listening. “Bring Zac to my office now!” I commanded the warrior that was standing guard over Cassie and Zac’s room. “Yes, Alpha.” He said back in our mind-link. The gates barely opened as I flew through them.. Rocks peppered the packhouse as slammed on my breaks. Sliding around the center floral display and packing on the other side. Alec managed to exit the vehicle before me and stay one step ahead as we made our way inside. I was vaguely aware of everyone scurrying away and the men standing up straight, ready for a fight.

“Colt.” Alec stopped in front of my door and had the nerve to put his hand on my chest, stopping me. Neither one of us had our shirts on yet so you could clearly see how worked up I was. “Do not go in there “How the f uck did you keep it level when it was Kristen that was f ucking kidnapped?” I yelled. “By understanding the only way to get her back was to make the right move. If you go in there hot headed, you could f uck this whole thing. up. You don’t want to know how I took my aggression out when we got her back.” Alec lifted the corner of his lip just a tad. Scowling, I turned away form him. I did not want to talk about how he defiled my sister. “She wasn’t

pregnant then.” I whispered.” “Exactly. You have your unborn baby’s life at stake. Make the right move.” Alec whispered so low that I barely heard him. He didn’t need me to answer as he opened my office door. “Colt? Um, Alpha Colt. Why was I tossed in here like I f ucked up something?” His voice did little to hide his irritation. “Cut the cr ap and just talk to me.” I said as I walked in and stood behind my desk. Alec stood by the door. “What is this?” Zac looked around before looking at the windows. “They are bullet proof and you cannot jump through them. Don’t think about it.” I said. He looked like a caged animal that wanted out. “Tell me why I am here.” He demanded. “Watch your tone.” I said deadly before I sat down to show him that I meant no harm…currently. This seemed to confused him but he stayed standing. “Did something happen? Is Penny okay?” “Penny is fine. I want to know what you know about Vin and Gunther.” “Vin and Gunther? Why?” that they were not part of the body count and Zec did a double taxe eten melund Alec “Excuse me? What do you mean they weren’t killed?” “Apparently, they slipped out of the building before we got there. They are still alive and out there somewhere “I was watching his Movements Zac sat down in an armchair and looked at the ground. “Who told you that?” “Tanya His neck snapped up when I said he name F ucking Tanya is alive? I thought I killed hernoveldrama

"What the fuck is going on here?" I said leaning forward.

"Gunther was the gamma and ten time worst than Darin. He makes Darin look like a toddler. He has literally killed a girl by fucking her face to the point she couldn't breath and died. Vin isn't much better but he didn't have the power that Gunther had. Tanya is just as evil. Part of me thinks that she was Rip's daughter. However, only men were wanted to if she was his daughter, he didn't give a shit about her and tossed her to live with the rest of them." "This just keeps getting better and better." Alec muttered.

"I believe Tanya was the one telling them what to do. They are stupid as fuck but she is not. If you caught her, there is a reason. Where is Penny?"

My eyes met Alec's instantly. He was out the door before I could even say anything. "Continue." I forced out from my mouth.

"What did she say?"noveldrama

"She only said it was an eye for an eye."

Zac stood up and started pacing. "I don't understand. If Tanya lived, why come after Penny?"

"Was Tanya pregnant when you attacked her?"

"Fuck if I know."

"Would the baby been Vin's or Gunther's?"

"Meaning she lost the possible baby of Gunther's? Making him want to kill Penny's future kids?" Zac asked. "Why are we even talking about Penny? Kristen was the one that killed them."

"Tanya looked right at Penny and said she took something and they want it back."

"Penny never took any pregnancy or anything from them." Zac looked at me like I was crazy.

"No, but you might have." I said and I didn't leave the resentment from my voice.

"I have done nothing but protect my daughter!" Zac roared as he pointed at me. I was still in my chair as I leaned back and looked at him. Alec came back in and nodded to me before just standing there. Good, the girls are safe and so is Tanya.

"What did you do so bad that they want to kill Penny because of it?" I asked.

"I did what I had to!" Zac yelled.

"That's not good enough! Your sins are coming back and this time, they affect my family. You being her biological father does not trump her being my mate. You will sit down and tell us what you did in the past so we can figure out why they want something from Penny."

"I honestly don't know. I lived with the rogues and slept in trees. I used to break into buildings for street cred and even participated in a fight club. I have killed more men from fighting than I anything. None of them were anything worth anything. They were all druggies or rapist. I never touched a female that didn't okay it. I killed anyone I saw that did it. Fuck, I even saved more girls the same way I left Penny. Every few months, I would hear something about an imminent threat on Penny's life and I would put a stop to it. I fucking saved this pack more times that you even realize!" Zac glared at me.

"At what point did Rip come after you?" I ignored his comment. He might have been right but he could have very easily came up to my dad and told him what was happening and didn't.

"After a few years, he realized it was me who was killing his hunch men. I think he got it on video or something and recognized me right away. Then he would come after me and Penny, Gunther has a nice scar across his face, compliments of me."

"Why did you almost kill Tanya and why did you think she died?"

"One night, I was in a fight club and saw her there. She was dressed as a waitress but she was working the crowd. It was a while later I spotted Vin but I didn't see Gunther." Zac shook his head. "After I won, she tried to give me something to drink but I forced it down her throat. Gunther came up behind me and grabbed my shoulder. I thought it was vin. Tanya had a knife on her inner thigh, I grabbed and whack! I was able to slip away. After that, I never saw Tanya out and about after that."






###Chapter 313
Chapter 0313 “Anything else you want to tell me? Now is your chance.” I said, unsure of how to handle this. “Let me go back in. I’ll figure out what is going on.” Zac ignored my question and slammed his hands on my desk. “I’ve spent my entire life protecting her, I’m not about to sit back and do nothing.” “Watch your tone.” I said as my eyes shifted back. “With all due respect, I’m leaving to figure this out. I rather us be on the same page and work together but I’ll do what I need to.” “What about Cassie?” I asked. “She will understand. This is our daughter.”

“You are part of my pack now. There are rules you must follow or we will have bigger issues on our hands.” I could see Alec nod behind Zac. He approved of him going under. “You can’t just kill to kill. We need evidence and not just your word.” “You’re not going to fight me on this?” Zac looked taken aback but almost gitty with excitement. “Zac, I knew from day one you were going to be a pain in my a s one. way or another. If you want to go under and figure this out, that is one thing I don’t have to figure out on my own. If you die in the process, oh well. Don’t get me wrong, I will send my entire army to save your stupi d as s but at the end of the day, I’ll be alive for Penny. If you pull this off, Penny might be one step closer to forgiving you. I haven’t forgotten you got my beta killed that day. I don’t forgive. So yeah, you want to go under, I’m not stopping you. Better your death than my men.” “…and Zac?” I said after he turned to leave. “What?” He turned to look at me. “If I find out you lied to me or mislead me in anyway, I’ll kill you myself. You will report to me daily.” “Understood.” Zac nodded before walking out the office. Alec shut the door behind him and took a seat in front of me.

“If he dies…” “One less headache for me.” “Would Penny forgive you?” Alec asked. “What would you do in my position?” “I’d make the same call but Penny is not Kristen.” Alec said. I just sighed at that. No, she wasn’t. Penny was everything sweet and loving. Her heart was massive and she cared more about others than she did herself. Penny was someone that needed my protection. Part of me knew Kristen could handle what was being thrown at her. As much as I hated it and it tore me up, I knew she would survive. Penny, I’m not so sure. I wanted to protect Penny from everything bad in this world. She needed to raise our kids in my mother’s house with a warm heart and the freedom that comes with peace. I had dreamed of the day of walking into our house with kids running around screaming. Penny with frizzy hair, standing over the stove, making dinner for our family. Penny has dreams of saving kids like her and I wanted her to be able to achieve that. She was an alpha too but I think she only thinks of herself as a Luna. However, she doesn’t know how powerful she really is. She is truly unstoppable if she wanted to be. 23noveldrama






###Chapter 314
Chapter 0314 “This is your rodeo but it might not be a bad idea to put someone else under to keep an eye on things.” Alec said. His finger tips were against each other in front of him. When he did that, he looked like his dad. “I just might know someone.” As soon as the words were out of his mouth, the image of Brad popped in my head. Picking up my phone, I hit the forbidden speed dial number nine. It was one I hoped to never have to use. The phone picked up and only breathing was on the other end. “Mansion blackbird.” I used our code word that was burned in my head. “I heard Brian died. My condolences. “I have a situation.” “You know what the cost is.” It was a statement, not a question.

“I’m prepared.” “This must be something juicy.” “You heard Rip and Darin died and my mate took over as Alpha?” “I hear many things.” “Rumor has it, Vin and Gunther survived and are after my mate.” “Interesting. Your dad never had this much drama.” Ignoring that comment, “Penny’s dad is Zac and he wants to go under and figure out what they are up to. I need you to find things out and keep an eye on him.” 12 “Hmm, I’ll get back with you.” Click! He hung up on me. “What’s the payment?” Alec asked. noveldrama

“Favors.” Alec just raised an eyebrow at me. “There was a reason dad forced Kristen to train and why we never seemed to be attacked.” “Maybe it’s not a bad idea to work with Penny on a few moves.” Alec suggested. “Even with her being pregnant?” “Even basic self defense moves can save someone’s life. She just needs to hold them off until we get there.” “Your acting like she will be in that position.” That annoyed me. “I didn’t anticipate Kristen being kidnapped once and voluntary get taken. Knowing what that would mean for herself.” Alec’s face darkened. “She wouldn’t have survived it had your dad not trained her or had such a powerful wolf.” “She had 18 years worth of training and still came out looking like a boxing bag.” “But she was alive.” Alec said and stood up. I had to give him that. “Let’s keep things running like normal. We don’t know how imminent this threat even is. I say we gather information and go from there. Be safe and what not but I can’t ask Kristen to close shop again just yet.” “I agree.” Alec slapped me on the shoulder as we walked out. “You know we area team in this.” “I sure hope so, I only willingly doubled your territory.” I joked with him. “Me or your sister?” Alec snorted. 212 “Is there a difference?” We walked out of my office and out to the car. There wasn’t a single bone in my body that felt good about making that call but I’d do anything to protect Penny. “Kristen doesn’t know about him.” I didn’t need to elaborate for him to understand. “Understood.” Alec didn’t even look at me but kept his eyes out the window. If there was one thing I knew about Alec, it was his ability to keep his word. Everyone was sitting on the porch when we got back. Laughing like they relaxed and weren’t worried. Three of them were pregnant so it wasn’t the worst thing they were relaxed. I was happy to see Jacob.

and Jasper were sitting on either side at the bottom of the stairs. If there was an attack, they would be front and center. I suddenly became aware I still didn’t have a shirt on. Neither one of us said anything as we walked up. I gave Penny a kiss on the cheek. before sitting down in the step below her. Draping my arm over her legs, I just listened to their conversation. “Okay, so we will come out earlier to help.” Penny said. “Help with what?” Alec asked. He had walked up to the top and was leaning against the post. 30






###Chapter 315
Chapter 0315 “Decorating for prom.” Emmy said. “Sherry and Penny are going to come out earlier and help get it all ready. “The club is having their grand re-opening Friday.” Kristen look at me like she wasn’t sure anymore. “Yeah, it is.” Making a me ntal note to highly increase security. “I have an envelope for you with dates. The Halloween party is a go. I’d like to do it at the event center too if that is open.” Penny said to Kristen. -“Perfect. I’m excited to dress up.” Kristen rubbed her hands together and looked at Alec. “What are you going to go as, Colt?” Jacob asked me. “A bodyguard.” I wasn’t in the mood to be thinking about Halloween. “Oh boo!” Kristen gave me a thumbs down. “Get more creat noveldrama

“Beauty and the Beast.” Sherry said. “Oh! I like that!” Penny smiled. “You don’t want my wolf walking around a party.” Shaking my head looked at Kristen. “We have a long time to think about it.” Alec said and stood up straight. “We need to head home. There is some stuff I need to do.” I told the group and stood up. “Not staying for supper?” Kristen frowned at me. “I’ve had enough of you for one day. Last thing I want is to sit through as for Halloween.” I tried to make a joke at Kristen. She just looked at me like I was st upid. “What a good brother.” She smacked my arm. “I try.” I said as I walked off to get the envelope for Penny. Truthfully, I didn’t want to see anyone right now and I knew I needed to come clean to Penny about what just happened. As much as I wanted to keep her in the dark, I knew that wasn’t an option.

Grabbing the envelope, I headed back to the group. They had all stood up and the girls were hugging each other goodbye. “Here, Ice.” “Thank you.” She said and took it out of my hands. Giving me a hug, but whispered so quietly in my ear that I knew no one else heard it. Congratulations, you will be such a great dad.” I gave her an extra squeeze before letting her go. Our eyes met and I knew I didn’t need to respond, that she knew my thanks. “Ready?” Penny asked, separating us. “Yeah.” Kristen walked back to Alec. After a nod to Alec, Penn walked back to the car and got in.. The tension was thick but I was more focused on how Penny was going to react to this. Jacob didn’t mutter a single word, nor did Sherry. The entire drive, was nothing but suffocating silence. However, I wanted to talk to Penny without being in the pack house. Jacob, Sherry… we are going home for the evening.” Penny had reached for the door handle but stopped. “Oh? Oh, okay.” Jacob said and motioned Sherry to get out. Penny didn’t say a single word as they got out and shut the door. 2/2 but enough that we could sleep here okay. Getting out, we walked up to the steps and sat down. The warm breeze gently tossed Penny’s hair as she patiently waited for me to speak. “I’m sorry…” I started. “I’m not going to like this, am I?” Penny nodded and looked away from me. “Probably not.” I said truthfully. “You heard what Tanya said. Alec and I spoke to the only other person who knows the inner workings of Rip.” It was silent for awhile before she spoke. “Zac.” “Yeah. He thought he killed Tanya but confirmed who Gunther and Vin were. He is going to go back under and see what he can figure out às to why they are after you.” I dropped that bomb and looked at

the silhouette of my beautiful mate. She was looking up at the stars but closed her eyes when I finished speaking.


###Chapter 316

It was hard to figure out how she felt. There was some indifferenceness, worried and even some happiness. It was a long time before she spoke again. “You trust him to do that?” “Not even a little. He did keep you safe your whole life so I’m hoping that will continue.” “He is putting his life at risk.” it was a statement, not a question. “Yes. Penny, it isn’t a perfect solution but as he lives his whole life. under the radar, he is the best person to figure this out. I don’t trust will tell me the truth. I don’t trust he won’t break the law but I do believe he will do what is required to save your life.” “At what expense?” Penny said, smally. “My only concern is for your health and our baby’s.” “What about the consequences to you?” “Don’t care. If you are alive, that is all I care about.” I answere truthfully.

“…and if he dies?” “Well, I’m sorry you didn’t get the chance to know your dad but he was responsible for Ace’s death…” “This is all business form you.” Again, it was a statement, not a question. “My mate and unborn baby’s life was indirectly threatened, this is personal. Sending Zac in… that was business but I can’t pretend I will lose any sleep if something happens. I’ll still send everyone to save his s tupid as s but I’ll still sleep just fine.” “What about Cassie? If he dies, she will too. “Then they will finally get their happily ever after.” I shrugged. “I would love for you to develop a relationship with her but I’ll chose your life. over hers any day.” “I don’t like any of this.” Penny said and looked at me. “I don’t either. This way be nothing. It could just be two guys that are blowing smoke and need to be eliminated. They just had everything taken from them. The chances of this being much is very little.” I tried

to soothe her. “You realize Tanya got into the pack without being questioned.” There was a fire in her eyes that surprised me. “Kristen checked. Tanya wasn’t ever listed as a pack member. She got onto their territory without being noticed. The land is massive. Which is why we gave them half, plus they deserved it, someone got in undetected.” “Da mn. I’m assuming she will tell Alec. I’ll still follow up with him. We will need to make sure out boarders are secure as well.” “How are you going to do that?” Penny asked. “We really need to get the new warriors trained but I’ll run a night check tonight and see how things are developing. This will tell me where we are slacking and need to improve.” I hated night time runs but there was no avoiding this. “Kara came by the office.” Penny said with a frown. “Oh? Why?” I was confused and surprised by this. I don’t think I have even spoken to her since Penny and I mated. “She wanted a job. I guess she planned on being Luna so she didn’t. have a future planned.” “I’m sorry you had to deal with that. Did you give her a job?” Flande “I did. I told her she can assist Mrs. Summers at the center. Until it opened, she can help in the kitchen.” “That was nice of you.” Putting my arm around her shoulders, I pulled her against me. The sparks are something I’ll never get tired of feeling. “You are one amazing Luna.” “I hope so.” Penny and I sat there for a few minutes before she spoke. again. “When does Zac leave?” “I’m honestly not sure. He might have already left to tell you the truth. Are you wanting to see him before he leaves?” I asked, unsure of what she wanted. EVDnoveldrama













###Chapter 317

Penny POV “Not one f ucking word!” Colt stood up so fast from his desk that the whole things bounced up and scooted forward just a little. Jacob had just came into our office with the mail when Colt had his little out burst. “Who?” Jacob asked confused and glanced over me at. “Zac! He left before we even got back from the baby shower and I haven’t heard one f ucking word from him. He was suppose to check in everyday.” The anger flowing through Colt was unreal. However, there hasn’t been a single incident or hint of a threat on me or this pack. Everything has been quiet. It feels almost normal still. We had this pack meeting in an hour and then we needed to head down to the club for the re-opening. Colt has even had Alec bring in some warriors for extra security surrounding this event. I wasn’t even going to try to talk to him or call him down. The mood swings weren’t bothering me but I think Colt got all the pregnancy symptoms instead. Other than wanting to sit down, I was feeling rather normal. No, I just am going to sit here in my own chair and focus on my own s hit. “You know how these things go. He might not be able to.” Jacob was trying to play devil’s advocate. The look Colt just gave him, told him to shut up. “Anyway, people have started heading towards the guy for the meeting. Sherry has ordered a computer and has finished the menu. She is changing and will be down shortly.” noveldrama

“How is she doing?” I asked. “It took her a long time to open up to me. It was like a slap in the face. “I’m proud of her for not allowing it to suck her down.” “She has been trying to remember anything that might help.” Jacob grabbed the back of a chair and leaned forward. “It’s not a horrible idea to interview the women…” Colt stated. “Yes it is! You will do no such thing!” I said instantly.

“Why?” Colt looked over at me. Standing up, I crossed my arms over my chest as I walked up to the boys. “They have been traumatized. Let’s just rip open the wounds that are still healing! No, we will wait till there is an actual threat before we force those poor women to go down that dark memory.” Colt put his head down as he tried to calm himself. “Alright.” He said after awhile. “We need to head down to the meeting. We are suppose to be celebrating.” Looking at my watch, it said we wasted half an hour on this pointless conversation. “See you both down there.” Jacob pushed off from the chair and left the office, leaving the door open. “Come on. Let’s head down there. Maybe we can start early.” Holding out my hand, Colt took it but yanked me towards him. Burying his head in my neck, he took a few deep breaths as his hands wrapped around me. He was trying to calm himself down. Wanting to distract him, my tongue grazed his ear as I let out a soft moan that I knew would awaken something in him. A deep growl ran up his chest as his fingers tightened against my skin. “You want to play that game?” Colt said as he moved his hand under my shirt. M “Alp…oh! I’m sorry!” A girls voice cried as she knocked on the open door. “I’m so sorry! The door was opened…” Stepping back from Colt, I looked over to see Kara standing there with a nervous expression on her face. There was also some sadness in there that didn’t surprise me. “What is it?” Colt asked but kept his arms around me as I turned to face her. “I.. um….” She looked around before taking a step back. “N-nothing.” Before we could say anything, she ran out of the room.







###Chapter 318

“That was weird.” I said and took a step away from Colt. “That is for you to care about. I have other matters to worry about. than her.” Colt sighed as I grabbed his phone. He put his hand on my lower back as we made out way out of our office down down to the conference center. It was already filling up as we made our way to the front. Sherry was already sitting there. There was a forced smile on her face and she looked rather pale. “Hello.” She said lightly as I sat down next to her. “How are you doing?” I asked. I hadn’t added to her list of stuff to do, I unsure of what she wanted. I had plans to include her in the Luna ceremony if she was up for it. “Doing okay.” She said and shrugged. noveldrama


“When you are feeling up to it, I have more stuff to get your help wit No rush just whenever.” “I’m actually good with more work. That will keep my mind busy.” Sherry looked relieved. “Perfect, I’ll email you what I am needing help with.” Colt sat beside. me and Jacob sat on the other. “Everyone is about here.” Colt said and put his arm around my chair. “Oh good. We need time to change and get to the club. I want to make sure things got set up how I instructed.” I said as I looked at my watch. Running late was not in my vocabulary. It caused me so much anxiety to not have things done correctly and ahead of schedule that I would go out of my way to make sure things went smoothly. “What are you wearing tonight?” Sherry asked me. 1/3 “I have a red pencil skirt and black silk blouse I am wearing.” I was starting to look bloated. Not really pregnant but like I have gas. “I can’t decide what I want to wear.” Sherry said. “My other choice is black leather pants with heels if the skirt doesn’t look good. You have those brown pants suit that fits you amazingly. Wear that!”

“That’s a good idea!” A smile spread across her face. Colt stood up and whistled. “Thank you all for coming.” His voice boomer across the room as silence fell. “We have many things we need to discuss so please pay attention.” I was looking around and my eyes landed on Cassie. He was sitting on a walker that had a built in chair. Sitting by the door, she was barely visible but Ms. Lucy was standing beside her. “First thing, tonight is the Club’s reopening. If you are of age, you are welcome to attend. I cannot stress enough that good behavior will be the only thing tolerated. The news will be there and any inappropriate behavior will be dealt with accordingly. Secondly, we are still tying up loose ends and as much as we are finding a new normal, I must encourage all women to remain cautious. Travel in packs and or with your mates. The risk is very minimal but I just want everyone to be safe. Especially when there will be alcohol involved.” Colt paused and looked at everyone. He had everyone attention and not a single soul was talking. “Next, the housing development is making great improvements. They are getting ready for interior items. Luna Penny has assigned houses. per family. If you wish to have a say in how it is finished, please fill out the forms and submit it to the head of construction. His name is Spencer. You can find these forms by the pack house door with the your name and house number associated with your name. P 2/3 cony na un different styles you can choose from or mix and match. These need to be completed by next Friday or we will choose for you.” Some people nodded and others whistled in approval or clapped. Either way, this was the simplest way I could figure out how to make everyone happy and not go overboard with styles.





###Chapter 319

Next, you will see Cassie walking around. As most of you know, Cassie has been imprisoned for 19 years and is getting her strength back. She is also Luna Penny’s birth mother. Zac is her biological father and was set to join the warriors but has been stationed else where for the time being. Please welcome them and come to us for any concerns.” A few people turned and looked at Cassie. A little blush crept up on her cheeks but she smiled and waved. Ms. Lucy put a hand on her shoulder and smiled at her. My face stayed passive. Colt sat down and it was my turn. “The long waited review.” I said and stood up. “The buildings going up. are a new program that I am implementing this year. First one, Mrs. Planters, please stand up.” A woman in her mid 40s stood up and waved around. She reminded me of Ms. Frizzle. “Mrs. Summers is the director at this center. It is called Director of the Development and Rehabilitation center. They will have programs include orphanage/ daycare, basic development and skills, emotional center and noveldrama

Pubfuture Ads
transition program for those with extra needs.” A around of applause sounded for her before she sat down again. “Mr. Kent is the Director of the Advanced learning center.” A male next to her stood up. He was going grey but I saw some of the women start to giggle. “There programs are for advanced studies for all ages, testing center, on-line schooling options and college courses.” Another round of applause but this was was more women. I guess the term silver fox would be appropriate. “Mrs. Planters- Director of Early childhood Development center, a 24/ 7 daycare for working parents from birth to 5 years of age.” Another long blonde hair and pencil thin legs. “All these programs are focused on the development of kids from birth to college age. All kids are welcome. Any wolf that needs a roof or food will be able to get everything they need. Like myself, I was

an orphan and needed the help. I am proud to say that the resources for those kids are now available. Each center is due to open at the beginning of the school year. However, each program needs volunteers or paid workers. Please see each director for those positions.” I waited a moment for the applause and everyone to quiet down. “We also have prom on Saturday. Again, we shouldn’t have to tell everyone to be on their best behavior. This was to make it up to everyone since we were on a lockdown. Next, we will have mine and Luna Kristen’s Luna ceremonies soon. Most likely in September. There will be a Halloween party on Halloween night. We are inviting multiple packs in hopes mates are found and even chosen mates could meet. Please start thinking about costumes.” Colt stood up as everyone started whispering excitedly. “The last bit of news, I would like everyone’s attention!” Everyone instantly closed their mouths and looked up at us, eagerly. “I am happy to announce that Luna and Penny and I are expecting our first pup!” Everyone lost their minds. The voice was so loud that I had to cover my ears. Colt put his arm around my waist and pulled me against him but was smiling as he looked at his pack. There was nothing of pure proudness flowing through me. Everyone was standing up and clapping. Even the new members were smiling from ear to ear. This was some good news that the pack needed. Colt eventually raised his hand for everyone to settle down. “Everything is going good go far but please assist me in making sure 2/3








###Chapter 320

Thank you all for coming!” Colt said when things quieted down.” Have a good evening! As much as we would like to hang around, we need to go change and head out.” People got up and started leaving. Colt took my hand and walked us out of the room. Thankfully he kept a firm grip because people kept trying to get my attention to say congratulations. As soon as we were in the our room, Colt pulled me into a huge before gently pushing his lips against mine. I wasn’t a shove me against the wall and f uck hard kind of girl. I liked the gestures and romance. However, being spontaneous was a dark luring thought. Right now…. Right now I wanted it hot and heavy. Usually I Colt took his time undressing me but the impatience got the better of me and I dropped his pants first. “W-what?” Colt asked in confusion but I didn’t answer him. Instead, I got on my knees and shoved his di ck into my mouth. Looking up at him, his eyes rolled back in his head as a deep growl vibrated up his chest. I was never that confident in my di ck sucking skills but watching Colt enjoy this was very satisfying to me. Only when his legs shook and his saltiness went down my throat, did I stop. “You have never done that before.” Colt said as he grabbed my face and kissed me.

“I’m trying new things.” I said as his tongue went down my neck. “Hmm.” Colt walked over to the couch and pulled my shorts down. before sitting me on top of him. Pulling me towards him, he kept kissing me as I felt his finger slipped inside of me. This was a new 13 position too. Tumayo Colt never made me do anything outside the basic. My hands shook as I reached down and pulled off my shirt, revealing the white lacy bra under it. Pulling his finger out, he grabbed my hips and picked me up, hovering over his di ck. As shocked as I was, I looked into his eyes and gave him the approval. As his d ick entered me, I couldn’t help but allowing my eyes to roll back and my head to sag from the

pleasure. This was a new kind of pressure that really hit a spot. “F uck, your so tight.” Colt growled as he unhooked my bra. His hands started showing me how to move my hips, forwards and backwards. His eyes never left mine as he watched my reaction. With my hands. on his shoulders, I used him as leverage to increase my speed. His claws dug into my hips and his eyes turned black. “Oh, Colt!” I moaned loudly as I felt the pressure increase. “F uck!” Colt groaned as he shot his load into me as my climax hit. I’m sorry.” He said between heavy breathing. “Why?” Uncertainly ran through me. “It felt so good. I wasn’t able to hold out. This is a new side to you.” Colt’s hands cupped my face but he didn’t make a move to pull out of me. “I know. I’m not sure what got into me. I wanted to try something new.” “Is the pregnancy increasing your desire?” Colt asked as his fingers ran through my hair. “I guess, maybe? I just know that trying some new things sound fun where I wasn’t sure about them before.” “That’s nothing to be ashamed about. Whatever you are comfortable WILL, W mym just too me wal comfortable with.” Colt said and there was a seductive smile on his face. That both excited me and scared me. “Oh? I don’t mean I am going to write them down and have a check list.” That seemed way to vulnerable! “How about I will randomly throw stuff in there. Keep it spontaneous. Let’s set up a code word so if it is too much, I’ll know to back off.”noveldrama

Okay, what word?” That was a huge relief. “How about Onyx?” Colt asked. “You can use that in a sentence, easy to figure out.” “When would I need to use it in a sentence?” I asked confused as I slipped off Colt’s di ck. “Are you showering?” Colt ignored my question and asked his own. “We don’t have time. I am going to clean up and then get dressed. “Okay.” Colt slapped my as s as I walked to the bathroom. After cleaning up, redoing some curls, I fixed my makeup before walking my naked a ss to the closet. The black lacy bra was the only undergarments I could wear. As I slipped on the pencil skirt, my desire s piked up again. Never once have I not worn underwear. With as swollen as my belly looked, this would be the last time I wore this skirt. Colt came into the closet as I was tying my strappy heels. “I don’t know about this skirt.” I said standing up. “I know I’m pregnant but this makes me just look fat.” “You look beautiful and se xy.” Colt said and slipped his around around me. In his hand was a black velvet box. He was holding it up. so it was impossible for me to miss it. noveldrama

“What’s this?” “This was my mother’s.” Colt said as I opened the box. “It’s worth a fortune but Ice was reading the description on each piece and this was has been passed down to the first born child for generations. So, she gave it to me. I want you to have it. You are the most selfless person I know. You have nothing but love in your heart and from what 1/3 1 YO VOLII Loru, just niRS THY THE It was a simple silver chain with a single black onyx stone in the middle. Colt took it out and gently put it around my neck. It sat perfectly between my collarbones at the base of my neck. The black silk blouse was perfect with it as the V neck allowed it to be shown off. “This is beautiful.” I said in awe. “That was sweet of Kris to give that to you.” Some people never

understood their bond but since I grew up with it, I never questioned them, nor has it ever bothered me. “She is still going through it all but she left it was only right that I had it. We can keep passing it in to this child when we die if not before.” “We probably need to start making a Will like your dad did. With description of our wishes.” I said as I turned around. “I love it. Thank you for trusting me with it.” “Only person I’d ever trust.” Colt said and kissed me. “Is that why you chose Onyx for our safe word?” I asked as Colt let me go and walked towards the door. He was in his usual all black outfit but did out in a red tie to match me. “It was.” “Very sly, Alpha Colt.” “We never did address if you wanted to be called Alpha or Luna.” Colt said as we walked down to the car. “I guess I really don’t think of myself as an Alpha. We joined packs. and we just kept taking on the same roles. It’s not like we don’t run things as a team.” “You’re okay being called Luna?” “I have just as much authority as you do even being a Luna. Unless it CLUJ LU UL call me Alpha Penny. Mainly because I enjoyed my role in the pack and didn’t want some of the decision making choices Colt has to. “Alpha!” A warrior’s voice boomed over everyone’s has the doors flew open. We had just reached the bottom step when two warriors brought in someone covered in a blanket. “What’s this?” Colt instantly pulled me behind me as the room went

"A car stopped a few hundred yards from the gate, tossed her out and sped off. She hasn't uttered a single word other than your name." They put her down and stepped back.

"What's going on?" Jacob and Sherry were walking down the stairs as Colt walked up to the girl. Her hair was tangled with leaves and dirt in it.

"A-alpha Colt?" She raised her head slightly. One eye was swollen shut, she had track marks on her arm and dirt covered every inch of her face.

"Yes?" Colt kneeled down but kept his distance.

"Eleanor?" Sherry walked around and stood behind Goll.

"Sher?"noveldrama

"Holy fuck! Eleanor!" Sherry ran forward and wrapped her arms around the girl.

"I need to tell you something in private, Alpha Colt." Eleanor pushed Sherry away so she could see Colt.

"Sherry, help her to my office." Colt said and stood up. Sherry helped her and and why the look on Coll's face, he wasn't happy,

Slowly, they made their way to our office and took a seat on the couch. "Eleanor? What happened to you?" I asked as the door shut behind Jacob.

"Zac got me out. He told me to tell you that he wants to meet at Sunday at 2am at the only hospital southeast of town. He said, to make sure you go alone."

"Zac got you out?" Colt asked.

"Yes."

"Out of where?"

"Underground sex/slave ring. They sold girls for breading, cooking, chores, or just as money. There was another junky he found dead that looked like me so he said he was going to tell them I was dead. He said you would keep me safe."

"Can I stay with her?" Sherry looked at Colt with so much emotion in them that it was then I felt like I was best for Luna. I couldn't rule with my head. It only my heart.

"We need you to make the initial appearance at the club but then you can come back here." "It's okay, Sher, I'm stronger than I look."

Sherry looked pissed off and sad but nodded. "Okay, I'll come right back." She said as there was a knock on the door. Jacob answered it and two nurses and a warrior walked in.

"Eleanor, these are two nurses that are going to get you to the hospital. You need examined and an I.V to flush whatever drugs are in you, out. Sherry, you wouldn't be able to sit with her while she is being treated anyway." Colt said as the nurses came around and gently took Eleanor from Sherry.

"With all due respect Alpha, that's bullshit." Everyone in the room froze.

"Sherry!" Jacob said as he looked over at Colt, worriedly.

Colt just raised an eyebrow at her but said nothing. "Eleanor, I hope you start feeling better." I said and broke the awkward silence. The nurses walked out with Eleanor and I shut the door. "We are running late and need to get going." Colt didn't take his eyes off Sherry, who was looking at the ground.

"Not that I enjoy being disrespected in front of others, I am happy to see you are growing a backbone. Next time, save it for in private." Colt said and walked to me. Quickly opened the door, we walked out of the office and to the car.

"Well, he isn't dead." I said awkwardly as Colt peeled out of the driveway. He gave me a sideways glance before turning back to the rode.

"Were you concerned?" Colt had white knuckles on the steering wheel.

"Yes..no. I guess I was more worried he was captured."

"He spend 19 years under the radar. He is too smart to get caught." Colt tried to relax as he shifted and put his hand on my thigh.

"Everything will be okay." I said as I leaned over. Getting up on my knees,y tongue grazed his ear...










###Chapter 323

Are you trying to make us later?” Colt asked as he squeezed my as s. “Just trying to make you in a good mood.” “I’m in some kind of mood. I might have to keep you pregnant if this is what I get.” Ignoring that comment, I whispered in his ear as we turned the corner. There was a large crowd gathered in front already. “I’m not wearing panties.” Sitting back in my seat, Colt fought with himself to keep his eyes from turning black as he pulled up. We were already so late. My door opened as a warrior held out his hand for me. “Luna.” He nodded.

Feeling rather flirty and proud of myself, I held my head high with confidence as I walked up to the rest of the gang. “Cutting it close, aren’t we?” Kristen looked disapproving at he ch before looking at Colt. “Not the time, Kristen.” Apparently, I was unsuccessful in getting in a good mood. Kristen raised an eyebrow at her. Her face was said all it needed to about how she felt about that answer. Alec put a hand on her back, keeping her from speaking again. “Colt! Are you ready to proceed? I can only stall for so long.” The new reporter came over. She was fluffing her hair and smiling too big for my liking. “Yes, we are ready to get started.” I said as I walked in front of him. She looked me up and down before smirking. “Good. Get in line. Colt 13 “She will stand beside me.” Colt said and pulled me beside him. Kristen was thoroughly enjoying the show and Alec walked up behind her. Jasper and Emmy stood slightly behind Kristen and Jacob and Sherry stood slightly behind us. “Little crowded but hey, if you want it to look weird…” She turned her back around and the camera man held up his fingers.. noveldrama

3.2.1. Go! “Good evening. We are here for the grand re-opening of Fang Licks. We have owners, Colt Jeffrey and Kristen Andrews. After closing due to unknown causes, they have decided to reopen!” She turned and looked at Colt. “Can you tell us why you decided to close the club? It was rumored there was structural issues.” “Actually, we had a death in the family and even though the new reports false information, we are where to open things back up. Family is everything to us. We appreciate all the support we have received and will continue to only provide high quality services.” didn’t wait for the reporter to say another word before he grabbed th scissors and cut the red ribbon. A round of applause echoed down the street. “I think we are done here. Thanks for coming.” Kristen said firmly and a little b itchy. The reporter opened her mouth to say something but Kristen got their first. “Goodbye.” Turning, Kristen walked into the club. Jasper and Jacob were holding the doors at this point for us to slip in. As soon as we were in, they allowed the staff to come in and then firmly closed the doors again. “Thank you all for coming. As you can see, we have renovated it. Please get accustom to the changes. Doors open to the public in a few hours.” Colt said with a big fake smile on his face. All this The staff all went off into their separate directions and we headed to the office area. I hung back a little and checked all the decor. The dance floor was a polished wood but I had a scuffed wood flooring. placed everywhere else. Part of me wanted to put carpet down but with all the spilled drinks, I wanted to avoid any smells, stains or growth of bacteria. Plus, men peed everywhere. This way, it was easier for them to get mopped everything night. The employee room. was looking amazing with their own fridge and tables. Lockers with locks and there was a list of cleaning duties out for people to do. Part of me left like this wasn’t my place. Colt and Kristen always handled all this, mainly Colt but seeing as he has been too occupied, I took it over. Life still goes on, even if you are fighting to save your sister. I think that is why Kristen and I always made such a great team. She worried about the big pictures and I remembered all the small details that needed to not get forgotten.











###Chapter 324

The bar was sparkling clean. The bartenders were washing glasses and cutting the fruit for different drinks. Filling the salt and syrups so they were prepared for it all. I even ran into a few employees labeling everything with dates. No one can ever tell me that we don’t have the best pack members around. The D.J was turning on all the lights and testing out the equipment to make sure it was working correctly. The bathrooms were getting one last look over and the tables were getting situated. Everything was looking perfect, so when I made my way into the office, I was surprised to see it a mess. “What happened here?” Papers were sca ttered everywhere, chair was flipped over and Colt looked ready to kill someone. “My dear brother needs to calm down.” Kristen had her hands on her hips, standing in front of Colt. Colt was looking down at her with annoyance. Alec and everyone else was just sitting on the cou watching the show between the twins. “How are you not more upset?” Colt said with a forced calmness. “I am not calm but I am not throwing s hit around, destroying our office!” Kristen held out her hands as she gestured to the room. Colt looked up at Alec. Alec instantly stood up and walked out of the office and Colt followed, without saying a single word. “Where are they going?” I asked, confused.

“To fight.” Kristen sighed as she picked up the chair. “Let me.” Jacob jumped up and picked up the chair for Kristen so she wasn’t doing any heavy lifting. 1/3 “To fight?” My anxiety flared as “Don’t worry.” Kristen waved me off. “They did this when things were getting hairy with me. Alec needed to let some tension out and him. and Colt went at it for awhile. They will avoid the face and will not cause any real harm. This will allow Colt to get some of his

aggression out.” She started picking up the papers and stacking them. on the desk. “He did this before?” “Yeah, we were both sleeping so I assume you didn’t realize it either.” Kristen seemed really unbothered by this. “I could have fought him.” Jacob said, slightly annoyed. “No, you couldn’t have.” Kristen gave him a look. “He needed someone to match him.” Kristen left out a few things I think she wanted to put in there but Jacob must have understood what she meant. “Is there any change I can head home now?” Sherry looked at Jacob “Not yet. Wait for them to come back. I know you want to get back to her.” I said, unsure of what to say. Sherry didn’t argue but nodded and just crossed her arms over her chest. Jacob sat down beside her and pulled her into a hug. Kristen and I started going through the paperwork and signing. different forms. Some of it was for the club, others were for our events like prom, luna ceremonies and even the Halloween bash. Kristen had designed some amazing invitations that she showed me. “Do you still have all the addresses?” “I do. They are at home on my computer. Do you want to ship these to my house or do you want me to email you the list? It is in a printing format so all you have to do is put in the labels and hit print.” “I’ll do it as you got your hands full with Colt,” Kristen widened her eyes as if to say she was lucky it wasn’t her anymore. “Gee, thanks.” I said as the office door opened and the guys walked in. They each had a light layer or sweat on them but I didn’t see a drop of blood. Alec stood by the door and just looked at Kristen. Colt came up to us. Giving me a kiss on the cheek, he tried to put his hands on my shoulders that I pushed off. “How are things going here?” He asked. I felt the hurt when I pushed him away but in this moment, I didn’t care. 379noveldrama









###Chapter 325

We finished everything as you threw your temper tantrum. If you excuse me, I am going to check the shipping order and then we are good to open the doors. You need to make sure the security is where they need to be and ready.” Standing up, I didn’t even look at him as I slipped around the desk and walked towards Alec. He had a rather amused look to his face but stepped aside and allowed me to leave. No one said a word as I walked out. I wasn’t sure why I was so annoyed at him at this moment but I was. There hasn’t actually been a threat on my life. Just some s tupid girl saying some st upid words. Colt is acting like my life has been threatened like Kristen’s was. Just because I am pregnant, he is going to lose his s hit. Going to the back room, there was boxes on top of boxes. Three different people were unboxing everything and putting it away. “Did someone check the shipping when it came in?” I asked as I looked around. noveldrama

“Yes, Luna. I did. Here is my list of what we got. It matched the shipping label which is right here.” A girl around my age that I didn’t recognize handed me two separate pieces of paper. “Perfect. Thank you.” I said as I took them from her. She was skinnier with long black hair. It looked damaged but she was wearing new clothes and had her hair pulled back. She just smiled and got back to work. She was either from Alec’s pack or was one of our new members. “Everything good in here?” Jasper came into the doorway. After all this time, I think I have maybe spoken to Jasper twice. Defiantly not a full conversation either. 1/2 “Yeah, we are good. Is the security ready to go?” I asked as I walked past him and out into the main area. I saw Alec talking to someone in all black and Sherry standing beside the door. Something about

her was just bothering me. “Yeah, they are all set.” Jasper looked at me and looked over at Sherry. “Is something wrong?” “I don’t know.” Jasper grabbed my elbow and led me to the corner of the room.” What is it?” “It’s Sherry. Ever since this girl showed up today, something has been bugging me about Sherry and how she is acting.” Jasper folded his arms over his chest and leaned against the wall. If anyone looked over at us, it would appear we are having a normal conversation. “Talk it out. Sometimes it helps to just voice it.” “I don’t know really. Sherry said Vin was mated to Tanya, her si Their brother was Gunther. I could be remembering wrong and I wasn’t in all the conversations but didn’t Darin introduce his Gam as Cash? I swear Colt told me that Darin came into Kristen’s shop and introduced Steven as his beta and Cash as his ga mma. Sherry is so urgently trying to get back to Eleanor that it just feels weird. I assumed that I misheard or I don’t know. Everyone was so focused on Darin and Kristen that they might not have known who the betal and ga mma were. It might not even matter.” I rambled as I watched Sherry look at her watch and look around the building. Jasper didn’t say anything but stared at me. “Have you told Colt this?” He said finally. “What? You mean between his level head and carefree attitude? I don’t know I even am right or if that is what is bothering me.” 2/2








###Chapter 326

“Come on, we need to tell them. Even if he is a little emotional right now.” Jasper said as he took my elbow and forced me to move. “I thought I was suppose to be the emotional one? He is just being dramatic.” I grumbled. This wasn’t like me but I couldn’t help but be annoyed. Jasper snorted but didn’t comment. Alec watched us approach him and followed us as we went up to the office. “Jacob, why don’t you stay.” Jasper said as we walked in. Jacob was walking out as we passed. “Jasper?” Alec asked as he closed the door. I was the only other female in this room. Where Kristen went, I have no idea. Colt was sitting behind his desk. He was leaning back with his hand keeping his chin propped up. Only half his mouth was visible but he was clearly interested and upset. “Penny has something she wishes to share.” Jasper moved me in front of Colt and stepped back. “I do?” I said as I turned to glare at him. “You do.” Jasper sat on the edge of the couch.


“Why do I need to stay?” Jacob asked. “Just stay there by Alec.” Jasper nodded towards Alec. Alec must have gotten the message because he dropped his hands and was much more alert. “Penny, what’s going on?” Colt asked. I felt like I was in the da mn principles office, snitching on some friends. The phrase, snitches get stitches echoed in my head. “I don’t know it is really anything.” I said as I moved to the side so my guys. “Just say it.” Jasper pushed. “Fine. This will be the last time I tell you s hit.” I said as I glared at him. He just raised the corner of his mouth in amusement. “Penny, what is it?” Jacob looked around, confused. “So, I could be remembering very wrong. I wasn’t part of the conversations and I only came in laternoveldrama

after Colt and I mated. Even then, he didn’t include me in decisions or discussions.” I looked at Colt. “I only know what you told me in private.” “But…?” Colt said threw his fingers. “I swear you told me when Darin came into Kristen’s tattoo shop, he introduced Steven as his Beta and Cash as his Ga mma. Sherry told us that her brother, Gunther was ga mma. I don’t know if Cash died and Gunther got promoted or if they lied and Cash was never the ga mma. I just know that it is bothering me how insistent Sherry is to get to Eleanor. She has never been one to provide emotional support or accept any form of it. Even now, she didn’t even want to ask me for a job.” I looked at Jacob with pleading eyes. No one moved when I stopped speaking. Jacob looked pis sed and confused. He opened his mouth a few times and closed it again, unsure of what to say. “So, you are saying Sherry is hiding something?” Jacob finally said. and took a step towards me. Alec instantly put a hand over Jacob’s chest to stop him from advancing. Jasper stood up and walked across the room to Jacob’s other side. “Seriously? You you think I am going to attack my own Luna?” He was getting pis sed off. “I’m sorry, Jacob. Like I said, it could be nothing at all!” My heart dropped to the pit of my stomach. “Jacob, calm down. You were in the tattoo shop when Darin introduced everyone. Penny isn’t wrong there.” Colt didn’t move but kept speaking through his fingers. “Colt, do you honestly think Sherry is capable of this?” Jacob pleaded at Colt. Alec had to keep his hand firmly on his chest.. “I think there is a logical explanation of what is going on. I’m not saying Penny is wrong or right. I am saying that what she told us does need to get addressed. Why don’t you take Sherry home and have a relaxing evening together. I’m sorry but I am commanding you to not say a single word to her about this. Tomorrow, we will bring her into the office and discuss this rationally. She might have a very real answer for this. Sherry cannot see Eleanor either until we have an answer.”










###Chapter 327

Jacob opened his mouth to speak but shut it quickly. Instead, he glared at him before turning and leaving, slamming the door behind him. “I got it.” Jasper said and left after Jacob. “This might be nothing at all.” I said to no one in particular as I looked up at the ceiling. There was little sparkles painted on to make it look. more like a night sky. “I don’t think Sherry has it in her to be a spy.” Alec said as he sat down on the couch. “I don’t either but I have to admit, I have been feeling off about everything since Tanya came into the picture. Sherry never did tell us her brother couldn’t have been the ga mma until now. She just kept saying she didn’t know anything.” Colt said as he kept looking at the door. “She might really not know anything.” Alec muttered. “F uck, for all we know, Vin and Gunther could just be little s hits that don’t even hold a rank. They could have lied and told Tanya and Sherry he was ga mma. Sherry told us her dad was dead and her mother was a warrior but then women were nothing but maids. If she mother moved from one pack to another to be with her mate, she could have been used too.”

“There is much more to Sherry’s story that we are not sure of.” Colt concluded. “I’m going to go check on everything. The doors open in five minutes.” Alec said as he stood up and walked out of the office. “Why didn’t you tell me about this?” Colt said as soon as the door was shut. “Because you have been so emotionally available to me? Because 1/3 don’t bring me to meetings, you don’t tell me half the s hit that is going on and you want me to be the good little mate and handle things while you are away. I did it because Kristen’s life was in danger and I know how important she is to you. Hell, she is like a sister to me, she saved me but this time it isn’t

about her. It’s about me.” I didn’t make a move to get closer to him. “Penny… I…” Colt took a deep breath. “Save it. We have to put on a happy face and greet our guest. Let’s go.” Setting down the shipping information, I walked out of the office, unsure if Colt was following me or not. The D.J. had the music bumping loudly as I walked towards the front door. Jacob was gone and the rest of the gang was standing around. ” Where is Colt?” Kristen asked. I opened my mouth to respond but his voice came up behind me. Right here. Open the doors.” He said and put his arm around my waist, firmly. Alec watched me clench my jaw but didn’t comment. Instead, he moved Kristen out of the way as Jasper opened the doors. Emmy was sitting on a stool against the wall, out of the way of any potential stampede. “Welcome!” Kristen said with a huge smile as people piled in. It wasn’t so fast as the guards at the door were checking IDs and looking for any potential weapons but it still filled up fast. Before I knew it, the bar was loaded with people and it was crowded. was p “Let’s go sit down at our table.” Jasper yelled. Emmy her hands on her back, supporting her belly. Following them, we sat down at a U-shaped booth. “This is where we were when we found out we were mates.” Emmy said as she looked at Jasper. “Same booth but you look a little different.” Jasper put his hand on her stomach as we all watched them. Kristen and I just looked bloated. “Not too much longer and you will be giving birth!” Kristen shrieked. “I’m ready to not be pregnant anymore.” Emmy agreed. “I bet, you don’t look like your comfortable.” I gave her an empathetic look.noveldrama





###Chapter 328

“I’m not. My back is killing me.” “Why don’t we get someone to drive you home?” Kristen looked at her friend concerned. “As much as I want to be here, I might take you up on that.” Emmy rubbed her belly and looked at Jasper. “I’ll take you home and I’ll be right back.” Jasper looked at Alec. Alec nodded in approval. “Good night! Congratulation on the opening!” Emmy inched her way out before she stood up. Jasper basically helped her stand before they made their way out. “Colt, are you going to pull the stick out of your a ss?” Kristen rounded on him. “Come on, Penny. I need to show you something.” Colt rolled his ey at his sister. “We will be right back.” He pulled me out of the booth and down the stairs. I wasn’t sure exactly where he was going but he opened a door in the back of the club. It was a storage room that was used for overflow and there wasn’t a lock on the door.

“Wha-” I about to asked before Colt grabbed my neck and kissed me hard. “I know I’ve been a jerk.” He said as he kissed down my neck. My brain was getting fuzzy as I looked at the door. “Someone might walk in…” I said as my breathing got heavy. “You said be spontaneous…” Colt’s hand moved down to cup my as s. “You want to have sex? Here?” This wasn’t exactly what I meant but I still mad at you.” “I know but I need this right now. I need to feel you.” Colt groaned. “But there is no bed…” I said as his hand started to raise my skirt. I had no panties on so my juices dripped to my thigh. “So?” Colt backed us up until my back was against the wall. I could hear voices on the other side of the wall as laugher got closer and moved away. noveldrama

“I… um….” Colt pulled my shirt out of my skirt, pulling it over my head, he unclipped my bra. “Da mn you are so f ucking s exy.” He muttered as he got on his knee. His tongue licked my folds as I looked at the door. Part of me was panicking, the other part of needing him to f uck me. As if my leg moved on it’s own, it rested on Colt’s shoulder, giving him access to me. Licking my juices off my leg, he sucked hard as two fingers entered me. “Oh f uck.” I moaned and my fingers threaded through his hair. His other hand came up and squeezed my t it as he kept working my c lit. The pressure was building up as. “Come for me, princess.” Colt groaned as my pressure toppled over. Princess was a rare nickname he gave me and only used it in times that he wanted to show me his love. My body shook as I rode his face. As hard as I tried to not moan loudly, I couldn’t help it. My body was craving his touch. Grabbing his face, I pulled him up, kissing him hard. Colt undid his own pa nts as he freed himself. Grabbing my leg, he hiked it up before putting his d ick at my entrance. “Look at me.” He growled. As soon as my eyes opened and met his, his di ck slipped right into me. Quickly but softly he moved in and out ned and sh ne best lufty but lighħelis butt i savitatii










###Chapter 329

After one more look at me, he filled my request. My face was flushed but the overwhelming amount of pleasure I felt was unlike anything else. I loved the slow, romantic love making. I loved Colt touching every inch of me but this was primal. This was deeper need that I never realized I wanted. After one more look at me, he filled my request. My face was flushed but the overwhelming amount of pleasure I felt was unlike anything else. I loved the slow, romantic love making. I loved Colt touching every inch of me but this was primal. This was deeper need that I never realized I wanted. I was just about to climax again when the door handle shook. Colt reached out and held it firmly but never stopped pumping in me. Slapping my hand over my mouth, I looked at Colt with wide eyes. He was watching my t its bounce with each thrust into me. The pressure won between my internal struggle it hit hard. My fangs descended as I bit down into my mark on Colt’s shoulders. Maybe a little harder than needed. My body shook as I pulled my teeth out. Colt didn’t allow me to lick it clean as he grabbed my hair and pulled my head back, exposing my neck. He bit down without hesitation as his own climax hit. The door was still shaking as someone was pounding on it. Colt let. out a deep growl and the pounding stopped. However, he didn’t pull out of me but kept me pressed against the wall. “I’m sorry, princess. I’ll do better.” Colt whispered into my ear.

“Good.” Was all I could say. My entire face was tingling. Finally, Colt set me down. He looking around and found some paper towels for us to use to clean up with. “You should go without panties more often.” Colt smirked as he “What if it is windy and my dress flies up?” I challenged as I put my shirt back on. Pulling my shirt down, I wasn’t able to see what my hair looked like. “Hmm…” Colt finished getting dressed and he walked up to me. Running his fingers through my hair, he must have been satisfied with how it looked before he took my

head in his hands. “I just can’t fathom anything happening to you.” He was feeling lost and loving at the same time. Showing me how hurt he is at the thought of losing me. “Let’s go dance.” I said as I kissed him gently. Thankfully, no one was standing outside the door as we left. Colt had gathered the paper towels and tossed them into a trash can on our way out. Most everyone here was wolves and would be able to smell what we just did. “I hope that put you in better mood.” Kristen said as we joined them on the dance floor. I wasn’t sure it was possible for my face to get more red but I think it. happened. “By the looks of your hair, you don’t have room to talk.” Colt tossed back as his hands wrapped around me. He held me close as he kissed my neck. “At least we aren’t emotional like Emmy.” Kristen grumbled. Alec and Colt both agreed. “S hit.” Alec shook his head as he grabbed her hands. Kristen was rubbing her as s against him and he was watching it. “Yeah, I’m thankful you just want this di ck more.” Colt joked as he turned me around. Pulling my arms over his neck, he held me close him him as we grinded. His forehead was against him as we got lost. in each other. Harafae valute to go.

###Chapter 330

I wasn’t sure how long we danced but the music changed and the D.J came over the speaker. “Last song of the night! You don’t have to go home but you cannot stay here!” He started playing Closing time, by Semisonic and the lights came back on. Colt stepped away but there was still a fire in his eyes that told me I wasn’t going to be getting much sleep tonight. “I need to shut down the computer in the office.” I heard Kristen tell Alec as Colt pulled me towards him and kissed me. He wasn’t ready to stop dancing but the law was the law. “Come on. There are some final things we need to do too.” I whispered to him. Grabbing his hand, we followed Kristen and Alec up to the office. “What do we need to finish?” Colt asked as he shut the door.

“I need your signature on these forms.” Kristen put a stack of papers on corner of the desk. “Seriously? What is all this?” Colt sat down and flipped through it. “Shipping things. I got it set up on auto shipping so if we get caught up, nothing will be missed. The payroll has been set up so we can access it remotely just in case and I also got the security loaded on your phone.” I said, trying to remember it all. “Kristen has signed it and now I need your signature.” “When did you do all this?” Colt looked impressed. “Last week or so. You have been so focused on everything else but pack stuff that I just didn’t without asking.” I was a little annoyed he was questioning it. 1/3 “Have you guys actually had time to get to know each other or spend any quality time together?” Kristen asked. “I mean, no but that’s okay.” “How is that okay?” Kristen asked. “When we found out we were mates, he was so focused on saving you that I was just kind of there. Don’t get me wrong, that is where his focus should have been. I’m not the least upset about it but sincenoveldrama

I was never really part of your group and we didn’t hang out before hand like you guys. Nothing has really changed. He treats me similar to how he treated Kara. I mean, you were a good boyfriend, I’m sure but he hasn’t included me in any decisions. So, I just am doing what I do best, staying in the background and doing what I hope you like.” The word vomit just kept coming. I didn’t mean to say half of it but it came out. Colt and Kristen were staring at me with open mouths and Alec just was nodding to himself. Feeling incredibly embarrassed, I just put my head down and walked out of the office. Closing the door behind me, tears threatened to fall. Not wanting to give in, I started walking around. Everyone was working like they should. The D.J. kept music playing so everyone. was signing or softly dancing as they cleaned. As I walked down to the dance floor, I stepped into something hard. The crunch was more violent than I imagined and it caused me to lose my balance. “Whoa! Luna, are you okay?” A female worker was sweeping when I tripped. “Penny!” Looking up, Colt, Kristen and Alec were walking towards me. They must have saw me trip. Looking down, there was a little yellow and black thing with something oozing from it. “Don’t touch it!” Kristen screamed and took a few steps back. I was half way down when she yelled, scaring me to the point the pack “What’s wrong?” Colt asked. He walked up to me and pulled me into him arms. “Alec, that is one of those bees.” Kristen said. Her face went pale. “The one that blew up knocked me out. The same ones Rip had hundreds of? The same ones we thought he smashed them all?” I saw him anger grow with each sentence.








###Chapter 331

Yes!” She grabbed Alec’s arm with white knuckles. “I thought we got them all.” Colt was angry. “This means Vin or Gunther are doing some surveillance.” Alec muttered. “Get me some gloves, container and cleaning stuff.” He told the pack member. She nodded and walked away. “Did you touch it?” Colt asked me. “No, just stepped on it.” The pack member came back with everything he asked for. Putting the gloves on, he picked the bee up and out it into the bag and zipped it closed. Grabbed the cleaner, he sprayed it down and cleaned it. The bleach was strong and even a little smoke rose up. Colt pulled Kristen. and I back as Alec leaned back. Eventually, he pulled his gloves off and threw them into the trash.

“This was more direct.” Colt said looking at Alec. “If it was on the floor and didn’t go off, either it died or out of range.” Alec said back. “Or it didn’t find it’s target.” I said without thinking. They all looked at me. “What? I may not have an IQ of 144 but I am highly intelligent.” Pushing off Colt, I just started walking to the door. I expected hand to stop me from going outside but that didn’t happen. Instead, I heard his footsteps fall beside me. Unlocking the car, Colt opened my door before going to the driver’s side. Colt didn’t say a work as he drove. He went past our turn off and kept driving. “Where are we going?” I asked when my curiosity got the better of me. get away from An n. I haven’t been there in years.” “Why are you taking me?” I asked. I could assume why but I wanted him to say it. “You are right. I was so focused on Kristen that I haven’t been a good mate to you. I’m incredibly sorry.”noveldrama

He reached over and took my hand in his, bring it up to his lips, Colt kissed my hand. “I want to start showing you the places I have been saving to share with just my mate.” Part of me wanted to ask why tonight he wanted to start but I held my tongue. “Where is this place?” “Just over here.” Colt pulled off the road and into an old trail that went through the trees. The moon was full and bright as it guided the path. Colt slowed down and came to a stop. He got out quickly and met me as I was stepping out. Colt took my hand and started walking quickly like a little kid in a candy store. “We need to run there?” I was slightly amused by this. “I’m just excited.” Colt turned and looked at me with a smile on his face. “I’ve waited to bring someone special here and now I get to do it.” I didn’t respond because Colt came to a stop. “What?” I looked at him. “Walk forward.” Colt pushed me gently, nudging me forward. Letting go of his hand, I took a few hesitantly around some trees until the most beautiful scene appeared in front of me. We were on top of a hill, over looking a small lake. The stars are bouncing off the water, owls were flying around and the sounds of crickets echoed across the valley. “This is beautiful.” I whispered as Colt came up behind me. His arms 213 “Yes, you are.” Colt turned me around. “I have a confession to make.” “Oh?” My heart sank. Taking a step back, I prepared myself for what he could say. However, he smirked and laughed at my expression. “I’ve been planning on doing this for awhile now….” “Plan on doing what?” I asked as he turned around and walked back into the tree line.









###Chapter 332

“Colt?” A sheer panic rose in me for a second before Colt emerged with a blanket and a pillow. “Did you think I was leaving you?” Colt laid the blanket out and dropped the pillow. Getting down, he padded the area beside him. “Might have ran through my head.” Sitting down, I was feeling a little awkward. Still mad that I didn’t want to cuddle but the scene in front of me was too hard not to. Colt sat up and pulled something out of his pocket. “I made this for you.”

“You made this?” It was a boho style bracelet with brown wooden beads looped together with a dark brown rope. On the end was a little wolf, carved out of wood. “Well, when I was like twelve. Carving is actually a hobby. I don’t know if you remember that. I know we didn’t exactly run in the same circle but there was one night. I was out in the woods, sitting against an old tree…” “I went for a night walk and saw you.” It was like a light bulb went off in my head. “You had a bl oody lip and told me you were just getting fresh air..” “That’s right. I was hacking away at a twig.” Colt filled in. “You said when you found your mate, you would treat her like a princess. Show her all the sights and never allow her to be abused.” It was like my heart fell out of my stomach. That was the night An n broke Kristen’s arm. He was blowing off steam and wasn’t in a good mood. “I was actually scared of you that night.” when you left. I vowed to give it to my mate as a reminder of my promise I made to myself. A promise to treat you like a princess. A promise to show you all these sights and be the man you needed.” Colt pulled my arm towards him as he put it on and tightened it. “I can’t believe you remember that night.” I was in shock. noveldrama

“I know the timing wasn’t good with Kristen and I am deeply sorry but I never forgot about giving this to you. I had a date planned to do this but when Tanya showed up and my focus moved from Kristen’s safety, to our pack’s safety and now to your safety. I called you my princess because you are. You are my everything. You and this baby. I want to protect you. I had dreams of coming home to my mother’s house with you standing over the stove, fizzy hair, kids running around and the smell of apple pie in the air. I never wanted to to worry but just be happy. However, I know that is fueled by how I grew up and the abuse Kristen endured. If that isn’t the life you want, that okay. You can come to every meeting. Be part of every decision o whatever you want. Just tell me and I’ll make it happen.” I didn’t have any words. My body reacted on its own as I threw myself forward. It took Colt by surprise as he fell backwards. His arms wrapped around me as my arms wrapped around his neck. My lips. smashed against his as he tried now to laugh. “I love the bracelet.” I whispered against his lips. “Good. I’ve been saving it for years. How fitting it was meant for you.” Colt rolled us to I was on the bottom. Colt’s finger moves up and down my cheek. “You have no idea how much I love you.” “So you have said.” I teased as I looked into his eyes. “I don’t think love is even a strong enough word for it.” His hand moved to the top of my head as he moved my hair away from my 2/3 “I’m not sure I want to be part of everything pack related. I want to focus on my side project and raising our family but I want to be part of everything when it comes to Gunther or Vin.”









###Chapter 333

“Then that is what we will do.” Colt kissed me gently. “How many kids. do you want?” “What?” I didn’t stop the laughter that filled me. “We’ve never really discussed these personal things. How many kids do you want? What names do you want? How do you want to decorate their nursery?” Colt propped his head up on his arm as his other arm rested on my stomach. “I like the first design for a girl but not as much pink as Kristen’s room was. More earthy greens and deep reds. For a boy, I was thinking just an outdoor theme. Animals and mountains with blues, grays and black. “I’m good with that.” Colt nodded. “As far as names, I have no idea. I haven’t really thought abou nes but I do have a bunch of baby stuff picked out on my computer. “I’ve always liked the names Duke, Anton or Hunter.” Colt said. “I really like all three. I guess Paige was a girl name I always liked. guess I’ve been drawn to the name Dawn or Maya.” “All go with the name Jeffery really good.” Colt nodded. noveldrama

“I want them be strong and determined but free to follow their dreams.” That’s really all I wanted for my kids. “They will be loved and cherished.” Colt nodded as his thumb rubbed my belly. “Are you going to go back to school and get your degree that your talked about?” Colt rolled so we were both looking up at the stars. “Oh, maybe. I mean, we are figuring out this threat and then we will have a baby. My priorities have shifted but that doesn’t mean I won’t in a year or so.” “I don’t want you giving up your dream.” “I’m already living my dream. I have a mate who is the most selfless, beautiful person ever. I have a

baby on the way and a pack that respects us. I’m a happy man. We fell into a comfortable silence. This was the first time I really felt connected to him. Like nothing else was going on in our lives and there was only us. “We should probably head back.” I said after awhile. “Yeah, we have a full day tomorrow.” Colt stood up before helping me. “I’m surprised you didn’t try to violate me here.” Colt smirked at me. “I’m still recovering from almost being almost caught at the not against you picking up at home though.” I winked before w into the woods, towards the car. “Is that so?” Colt caught up to me easily. I’m “Yes, sir.” Sliding into the car, Colt got in the front seat and started the engine. As soon as we were back on the road, Colt reached over and moved my skirt up. “What ar-….oh!” up.” His fingers didn’t hesitate to slip under my skirt and in me. My legs moved apart on their own as my hands reached out and grabbed the window and his shoulder for support. “You are never wearing panties again.” Colt’s eyes were on me. “OH!… The road….” The pressure was building but he wasn’t even IVUUJ VII anyuny his thumb massaged my cli t. “What about it?” “Oh f uck…” I could feel my juices running between my as s and the seat. Right as our territory came into view, I was very much aware that the guards were standing there. “COLT!” The gates opened as we approached. “Do NOT cu m yet.” He demanded in a thick voice. My body shook as he pulled up to the pack house. It was very late or very early in the morning but my heart was pounding. Colt pulled me on his lap. Without removing his hand, he carried me as he went to

our room. “What if someone sees us?” I moaned in his ear. “You are so f u cking wet.” Colt nibbled my neck. I had to bite his shoulder from crying out as we went up the stairs. His fingers never stopped moving. “I need to cu m.” I groaned as my hands gripped his shirt for support.









###Chapter 334

“Not yet!” He growled. I heard the bedroom door open and slam shut before Colt ripped his fingers out of me and dropped me on the bed. “-” Colt grabbed a fist full of clothes and ripped them off in one motion. My shirt and skirt were gone. All I had on was my bra. I didn’t even have a chance to form a word in my mind before his pants were off and he rammed into me. “Look at me!” He growled. I didn’t even realize my eyes clothes but he was moving more calculated and deeper than he ever has before. His movements were like waves in the ocean as he slipped in and rolled out. Colt grabbed my leg and flipped me around so fast that I was speechless. Grabbing my hips, he pulled me back so my as s was in the air. His d ick slipped in, creating a whole new sensation I wasn’t used to. “COLT!” I screamed as my or ga sm was right there. noveldrama

“NO!” Colt pulled his di ck out of me. Whimpering, I was about to speak but his tongue licked my cli t alway to my as s. My arms gave out as he worked his magic. As he sucked on on my cl it, my body gave out and my or gasm hit hard. Colt didn’t even stop. As soon as my o rgasm hit, his d ick went back in and after a few pounds, he climaxed as well. Letting out a deep growl, I just fell forward, exhausted. Colt plopped down next to me but I was already passed out. The next morning, Colt was already out of bed when I woke up. opening my eye, our ai u Tiv Princess,

You looked too beautiful to wake up. I got up to do some training with the men and make sure the security is where it needs to be. Kristen will be here at 9am to take you to the event center to look at the decorations. Otherwise, you just relax and enjoy your day. I’ll see you to drive us there. With all my love, Colt This was a different side of Colt that I havent seen much of. A wide smile involuntary-filled my face as I read the note over and over again. The clock showed 8:23am and a little panic erupted in me. Should I shower now or wait till later? I’m sure I smelled like sex so maybe I’ll just rinse off and do a full shower later. “Good morning, princess.” Colt mind-linked me. “Good morning to you too. Thank you for the flower.” “Did you wake up and smile?” “I did.” “Good. How are you feeling?” “I’m good. Excited for today.” Shutting the water off, I got out and started drying off. “How did you feel about last night. Was that too much?” I could feel the uneasiness from Colt. “I liked it.” Suddenly, I was feeling a little self conscious talking about it. “It was different.” “Different good or different bad?” WI “Good. There was new sensations.” Pitting on just a simple T-shirt and shorts. Pulling my hair into a ponytail, I was ready to go. “Hmm, I got to go but try to have a good day and don’t over do it.” Colt said. It sounded like he was distracted. “Okay! Bye!” Cutting the mind-link, came down stairs. Kristen was standing at the front door, talking to Sherry. “Ready to go?” I asked Kristen as I got closer. “Yeah, I came to grab you, per Colt’s request for some reason and we can head down there.” Kristen

gave me a big smile. “I’m ready to go too!” Sherry said with a smile on her face. My heart did a little flip and I glanced at Kristen uneasily.










###Chapter 335

To say that the morning was awkward was an understatement. Guilt flooded me the more I looked at Sherry. She was opening up and actually helping with decorations and problem solving. I really hoped there was a simple explanation to this It wasn’t that I was afraid of conflict but for Jacob’s sake and for our friendship, I was scared to just come out and ask her. I wasn’t even sure when Colt was planning on addressing it. Was he going to do it before prom? Surely not, he said he would see me when we left. Maybe tomorrow then. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I burnt my fingers on my curling iron. “Are you okay?” Colt asked in the mind-link. “Yeah, just burnt my fingers. No biggy.” “You’re not suppose to touch hot stuff, princess.” Colt teased. “No s hit. I am curling my hair. We got back a little bit ago and I started getting ready. I was just thinking and got distracted.”


“What are you thinking about? Did today go good?” Colt grunted as he spoke. “It went good actually. Sherry came along. I kind of forgot she was going and I guess I was a little awkward around her.” “Did you say anything?” Colt asked. There was zero emotion to his voice. “No, she was actually really helpful and did a great job today.” “Jacob said she was excited about prom.” “Are you getting ready? We need to leave in an hour.” I asked. “Headed there now. I got stuff in a spare room. Figured your stuff would be everywhere.” “It’s not everywhere.” I cringed as I looked at the counter. It was indeed everywhere. “Yeah, okay.” Colt laughed. “See you soon.” “Okay.” He didn’t cut the link but he pushed it to the side so it wasn’t front and center. If I tried hard

enough, I could probably hear what he was saying but that felt like spying and I wasn’t about that. After curling each piece, I had it pinned up. Then it was time to do my makeup. I had picked out a se xy dress but that was before I got pregnant. Now I wasn’t sure how it was going it fit. It was a black rhinestone fitted dress with a deep V plunging neckline. The V had a wave to it and was lace. The black lace laid over a blush skirt that had an ombre to it. The whole thing was covered in rhinestones. Even the train sparkled. Doing a simple smokey eye with a little tan to it, I made a simple winged eyeliner. After satisfied with that, I let my hair down. Pulling the top back, I pinned it very loosely and fishtail braided it. Pulling out a few face framing pieces, I added some rhinestone bobby pins to finish my look. Getting undressed, I put on a sticky bra that just lifted and secured my breast. Since Colt seemed so turned on by no underwear, I didn’t put any on. Slipping my dress on, my breast were almost popping out. They had gotten so swollen and plump that there was no hiding them. Using some tap, I did what I could to keep them secured. My stomach. had a little bump where my dress was a little tighter around my growing baby. Knock! Knock! Assuming it was Colt, I yelled, “come in!” she knew I wandere “Casa” Waking out brom ked Case.

“The only piece of property I own.” Cassie smiled warmly at me as she held out the box. “Princess! Are yo- Cassie?” Colt came into the room. I watched his smile instantly fall as he looked at Cassie. “I wanted to give Penny something.” Cassie told Colt. “What is it?” I asked as I took the box. Colt came around and stood I beside me. “I had cut a small hole in the rags I was given to wear and hid those in them. They were my mother’s earrings. Rip had taken everything else but I managed to hide these before they were taken too.” Opening the box, there was a diamond halo around a circle black stone. They were beautiful. “You hid these in your shirt?” Colt aske “Yes. You can ask your nurses. I refused to let them destroy the clothes and had them pull those out. I was waiting till a good time to give them noveldrama

to you “They are beautiful.” I said, unsure of what to say. “They match great to your dress but if you don’t want to wear them, I understand.” She looked at me nervously. “Of course, I’ll wear them.” Colt took the box for me so I could put them on. “How does it look?” I asked I walked up to the mirror. I couldn’t even recognize myself. This woman was beautiful.” Amazing.” Colt said as he came up behind me. He was wearing black pants and a white shirt. He had a tie tightened around his neck and he was rolling his sleeves. His hair was helped back and his five o’clock shadow was s exy as hell. “You guys make a beautiful couple!” Cassie said as she clapped her hands together. “I just need my shoes and then I’ll be ready.” Smiling at Cassie, I went to the closet and pulled out my heels. They were just black strappy four inch heels. I had painted my toes and fingers black to match.

“Ready?” Colt asked as he checked his watch. “I am. Is Jacob and Sherry riding with us?” “No, they are driving separately but are following us. Just in case we want to leave at a different time.” Colt’s eyes kept looking at my t its instead of my eyes. “Well, you two have fun!” Cassie said as she went to walk out. “Thank you, Cassie. The earrings are beautiful. Are you sure you want to give them to me?” I asked. “Oh yes. I have dreamed of the day I could do this.” She smiled warmly at me before walking out. “Okay, well, let’s go.” I said as I took a few steps towards the door. “Hold up.” Colt grabbed my arm and whipped me around so I ran into his chest. “You look so f ucking delicious.” He growled as he grabbed the back of my hair and pulled my head so he could kiss me hard. I could feel his d ick pushing against his zipper. “You have to wait till after, Mr. Alpha. I look too good for you to mess it up.” “That is why we are driving separately.” Colt growled as he grabbed a handful of my as s. We walked out of our room and down to the garage. People were all down dressed up and waiting for their dates. Colt had pulled out his Lamborghini for tonight. The matted black sports car was just the “I have to say, I’m excited for this!” I said as we speak out.of the pack. house. “Anytime I get to wrap my arms around you is a good time.” Colt said. “Your chest is in full display though.” “I got this dress before I got pregnant. I do feel a little exposed. There wasn’t anything I could do to hide these puppies.” “You’re making this hard to not f uck you here and now.” Colt adjusted himself. “Let me help.” Reaching over, I unzipped his zipper just a little before his dic k busted out. Almost hitting me in the face. “Oh f uck…” Colt groaned as my mouth wrapped around his di ck. His hand reached over and squeezed my a ss as I moved faster and faster around him. Wanting to drag it out, I stopped and blew some air him, or just lightly licked him. Cupping his balls, his hand sque harder as he shifted a few

times before he finally blew his load d in my throat. 3:3











###Chapter 337

“Feel better?” I asked as I sat up and made a show of cleaning off my lips. “Just hornier.” Colt groaned as he fixed himself. Unfortunately for him, we were pulling into the event center. “You will just have to wait till later.” Smirking at him, Colt pulled into a parking spot. “Sooner than later, princess.” He promised as he got out. Coming around, he opened my door for me. Taking his hand, I stepped out into the warm summer night breeze, “Beautiful evening.” I said as he walked up. “You look amazing.” Colt said as he pulled me against him. “Glad you like it. You don’t look so bad yourself.” Stopping him, he looked at my confused for a second. Grabbing his tie, I gave him a seductive smirk as he yanked his face towards me. Wrapping my arm. around his neck, I kissed him hard. He didn’t disappoint as his hands. went around my waist. “Get a room, you two!” Kristen’s voice echoed across the parking lot. Breaking the kiss, Colt let me go but wasn’t happy about it. “You look amazing!” I said as I looked at her dress. It was black and fitted with holes on the side. Her figure was something I dreamed about for my own body.

“Your ti ts are f ucking amazing!” Kristen pointed out. “They are a little much.” I said as I felt a blush creep up. “Nope, just the right amount.” Colt and Alec shook hands before ying muncu “Is Emmy coming?” I asked. “She is.” Kristen had a look to her face as Alec shook his head. “Having a pregnancy issue?” I asked as we walked towards the door. “She is so close to her due date and so uncomfortable. Jasper wanted to stay him but she refused. She looks good but Jasper is afraid this will put her into early labor.” noveldrama

“Is Jasper all healed?” I asked. “Yeah, he is back to normal. Still has a limp to him but he is ready for the baby.” Alec said for the first time. “Do you have any pregnancy symptoms?” I asked Kristen. “Just craving sweets. Anything chocolate is getting ate.” “Chocolate covered pickles with nuts.” Alec nodded. “That sounds horrible.” Colt faked gagged. “Don’t knock it till you try it.” Kristen looked at him. “I did, it was not good.” Alec confirmed, earning him a nudge to the side. Alec just smirked and put his arm over her shoulders. “What about you?” Kristen asked. “Just need to sit down. Not really nauseous but just feel like standing is too much.” I wasn’t about to tell Colt’s sister I can’t stay off her brother’s di ck. “Let’s just keep it light.” Alec sighed. “Poor b astard.” Following his eye sight, a car just pulled up. Jasper let Emmy out at the door before parking. She was huge but looked great in her baby blue dress. It went to her knees and the back flower down to her ankles. However, she didn’t brave heels. “Hey, girl. You look great!” I said, trying to be friendly. “Not sure why I chose blue. I look like a whale if it got stung by a pee and had an allergic reaction to it.” That was quite the comparison. “I think you look stunning.” I corrected. “There is Sherry and Jacob.” Emmy sighed. “I’m ready for food.” Kristen and I hid our smiles as they approached. “Hey! Look at Jacob cleaning up nicely.” “It’s been known to happen.” Jacob fixed his tie. “Ready to go in?” Jasper ran up the steps to meet us. “Yes! Let’s go!” 3/3











###Chapter 338

An applause broke out as we walked in. People were everywhere. Lights were turned low so the lights we hung really set the mood. Dark blue and silver sheer fabric was draped down from the ceiling. We had made a mason jar chandelier and hung big fake diamonds off them. The D.J. was off to the side and the catering company was standing off to the side. As we found our seats, Kristin and Colt walked up to the microphone. “Thank you all for coming!” Kristen said with a huge smile. The crowd cheered so loudly that I thought I was going to go deaf. Colt held up his hand after awhile. “After our recent trouble, today is a night to let loose and have fun. Since we had to miss the school prom, we are making it up to everyone.” More applause kept Colt from continuing. “I would like to take a moment to recognize the women that made this night possible. Kristen and Penny spent hours organizing this whole thing. With Sherry and Emmy, these women have made this might possible.” Whistles and hollars were echoing off the wall. “Thank you! Please enjoy your evening and have fun!” Kristen had to yell. Everyone sat down as the catering company wheeled out plates of food. Kristen and I were in the middle with Colt and Alec on either side of us. Jasper was beside Alec with Emmy on the end and Jacob was beside Colt with Sherry on the end. A grilled duck breast on a bed of rice and steamed vegetables were placed in front of us. The music started playing as everyone laughed and talked with each. other. “This was a great turnout!” Kristen said to me. noveldrama

“It really is! I’m ready to shake my a ss.” I finished half of my food before I set my food down. “Bring in Halloween!” Kristen started dancing in her seat as she finished her duck. Alec looked over at her and raised an eyebrow but otherwise didn’t move a muscle on his face. He leaned back and just watched her. “How is the warriors coming along?” Colt leaned back and asked Alec. “No shop talk!” Kristen pointed her knife at Colt and narrowed her

eyes. “Can I set Alpha Colt and Alpha Alec and their Luna’s down here for the first dance!” “Wonderful.” Alec grumbled as Kristen pulled him up. Colt held out his hand for me. Colt POV Twirling my beautiful mate before pulling her into my embrace for this st upid first dance. She was smiling ear from ear as her hand wrapped around my shoulders. Strawberry Wine came on as I looked into her eyes. “Having fun?” I asked as we started slow dancing. Our faces were inches apart when she got even closer. Our foreheads rested against each other. Grabbing my tie, she pulled me down so she could whisper in my ear.” I’m not wearing panties.” Holy f uck! This woman was driving me crazy. She always made my d ick twitch but this version on her was keeping me hard. My hand was resting just above her as s when she spoke. I wanted nothing more than to grab a handful of as s but it took everything in me to refrain. “F uck, woman.” I couldn’t keep the growl from my voice but the goosebumps down her arms told me she enjoyed it. “You told me no more panties.” She snickered at her own doing. “I didn’t think you’d listen.” I said as I fought off my wolf. “Why so?” She seemed genuinely confused. “I love you more than anything in this world. You have the kindest soul and are a very respectful woman. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be lucky enough to have someone like you. Since I’ve known you, you are modest and don’t show off your amazing body. As much as I love that about you, I didn’t ever think you would be comfortable wearing a dress like this and no panties in public. Hell, you haven’t even worn lingerie for me. Why are you changing who you are?” 13














###Chapter 339

I watched my words sink in. The feelings of hurt hit me as she felt them. “I-” “Penny, I love modest Penny. I love this Penny.” My finger ran down between her chest. “You always make my d ick hard. I just don’t want you to do anything you are uncomfortable with. I’ve been pushing you lately and I just want to make sure you are okay. Nothing is more important than your happiness.” Cupping her face, I tilted her face up so I could look into her eyes. “I want to keep exploring this.” She said without hesitation. Smashing my lips against hers, I was vaguely aware everyone was cheering. Part of me forgot we were dancing. “Let’s get this party started!” The D.J yelled and Shake it off by Taylor Swift came on. Kristen grabbed Penny and they started dancing with some other girls. Alec and I walked over to Jasper and Jacob. They were standing off to the side. “Here you go.” Jacob handed me so e whiskey. “I thought this was dry.” I said but downed my drink. “Is it prom without alcohol being snuck in?” Jacob laughed. This was the behavior that made me still question his maturity. “Where’s Emmy?” I asked Jasper.


“Over there.” He nodded to a table off to the side. There was a group of my pack members around her like they hadn’t seen her in ages. “Any day now.” Jacob teased. “I’m not complaining.” Jasper kept his eye on Emmy as she laughed. “You two stay here and alert. Colt and I will be right back.” Alec said as he set his glass down. “Alright.” Jasper said, still ot taking his eyes off Emmy. Following Alec, I waited till we were outside. “What’s going on?” “Three girls ran up to my security. They are half naked and bl oody.” “S hit.” I swear, if Zac is involved, I will strangle him. “Yup.” noveldrama

We walked out a few hundred years and into the treeline. “Alpha.” A warrior nodded and stepped back. There was a total of five warriors, all dressed to the T, with machine guns. Alec wasn’t taking chances. As they opened up, we saw three girls. They were huddled together, shaking, naked and bl oody. Bruises and old cuts covered their body with some fresh new cuts. “What is going on?” Alec asked. “These women ran up to us asking for shelter.” A warrior said. “They are after us!” Girl one cried. “You have to save us!” Girl two said. “He told us you would!” The third girl looked like she was twelve years old. “Who did?” I asked. “Zac. H-he said you will protect us.” They all looked so different. It was hard to tell exactly what race they were or even what color their hair was by how dirty they were. No one spoke as my mind race. I still didn’t have Eleanor’s story yet and now three more girls show up? What did he think my pack was? He knew I wasn’t going to turn down stranded women but da mn. “What happened tonight?” I asked. “Zac snuck us out from where we have been kept. We have been sl aves for different men. Zac wasn’t exactly nice but he didn’t…. Hurt us. A fight broke out in the camp and Zac grabbed us. I thought he was kidnapping us at first. The other guys thought he was so they came after us.” The first girl said without making eye contact. “When we were driving away, they hit us and we fell off a bridge. Zac was stuck but we got out. He told us to run and not look back so we did.” “Did Zac tell you about this place?” Alec asked. That question confused me but I didn’t ask. “Yeah. He said someone named Colt was here and could help us.” “Zac was stuck? In the car?” I asked. “Yes. I don’t know if he got out or if the bad men found him.” The second girl said. “Are you Colt? Are you guys going to kill us?” The littlest girl looked at the warrior’s guns.








###Chapter 340

“No, we aren’t going to kill you.” I said, unsure of what to do. “How many men were following you?” Alec asked. “Don’t know.” The youngest started crying, leaving a smear of dirt behind. “Alec.” I muttered and walked out of ear shot of them. “We can’t leave Zac…” Alec started. “Would solve some problems…” I didn’t exactly want him dead but he was getting very annoying. “Penny would not be happy, I assume.” ” F uck…no. Okay, have a warrior take the girls to your my pack and get them cleaned up. We need to see if we can find Zac. Tomorrow, we can interview all four of them for details.” I said. It pis ses me off I was going to have to leave Penny. She was so excited for this. “Kristen won’t be happy.” Alec said as we started walking back to the party. I looked back and three warriors were helping the girls walk towards the parking lot. “Neither will Penny.”

The party was in full swing when we walked back in. Everyone was where we left them. Jasper and Jacob were laughing at something. Emmy was still talking to some girls and Kristen and Penny were in the middle. “I’ll grab them.” Alec volunteered. My good mood was gone. Now I was just pi ssed off. Penny had a fresh layer of sweat on her forehead as she came off the to me. “Let’s go outside.” I said as I took Penny’s hand. “Ooo! What do you boys have planned for us?” Kristen gushed. The warm nights air hit my face as we made our way to an area we won’t be over heard. “Why are you feeling guilty and mad?” Penny said in a very with drawn tone. “This isn’t a surprise, is it?” Kristen said as the girls stood by each other and faced us. It broke my heart to see the hope fall from their face. noveldrama

“What is it?” Penny said after awhile when neither of us spoke. “Three girls ran into our warriors not that long ago. They were wearing rags and are completely filthy.” Alec started. “Are they okay?” Penny asked, unsure. “Physically, they are okay. Other than they were running from people chasing them.” Alec said. “Who were they running from?” Kristen asked. “They didn’t know. All we do know is the camp they were kept broke out into a fight. They got out and their car was crashed. They managed to escape but the driver was stuck. They heard people. follow them so they ran.” Alec continued but Penny looked into my eyes. “The driver….?” Penny said barely above a whisper. “Zac.” I confirmed as she closed her eyes. “Is he alive?” Kristen asked as Penny hung her head. “We don’t know. All we know is he was stuck and they ran.” I said to Kristen but didn’t take my eyes off Penny. “Are you going after him?” Kristen asked as she collected herself. Neither one of us spoke but looked at Penny. After a moment of silence, she looked up and me and nodded. “We will be back as quickly as we can.” Penny walked into my arms. “Please save him.” This whispered but Alec and Kristen still heard her. My head was rested on hers as I looked at them. They were both just looking at us. Kristen had so much pity in her eyes as she looked at Penny and Alec was passive as ever. “We will be everything in our power to bring him back.” I said as I looked down at her. “Come on, Penny. The guys will save him. Let’s go back inside and try to have some fun. I’m sure he will be okay. Zac is too much a pain in the as s to not be okay.” Kristen took Penny’s hand and started walking back to the party.

‘Thank you.’ I mouthed to Kristen before she turned back around. “Let’s get this s hit over with.” Alec slapped my chest as he started walking.









###Chapter 341

“Might just kill him myself.” I grumbled as we walked into the forest. “That’s an intriguing idea.” Alec snorted. “Then you get to be the one to be undercover.” “F uck off.” I replied, only to hear a rare laughter from Alec. “His little slimy as s might actually be helpful, assuming he survived this.” Alec said. “So far, all he has done is save girls. Never once has he tried to speak with me, update me or tell me if he found a threat. All I know is he has been in questionable positions.” “I mean, saving them wasn’t a bad thing.” Alec was playing the devil’s advocate. “Since you seem to like him so much, they can move to your pack and you can be in charge of him.” “Naw, your sister keeps me busy.” Alec sounded more serious. “I can’t say I’m even a little bit sorry for you.” I did that for 18 years, now it was his turn.

“I can tell.” Alec said but didn’t elaborate. We stopped bickering the further we got. The girls didn’t run very far and the highway was just to the left of us. Assuming he was in the area of the city, known for underground activities, that should make him in the area we were headed. As we went further into the thick brush, the sound of a horn blasting was getting louder and louder. Alec and I were walking as quietly as possible, inching our way. A small line of smoke was snaking it’s way The sheer impact broke the tree. Alec’s phone lit up as we moved in. It must have been important because he answered it but didn’t say anything. After a moment, he hung up and started texting someone. A few seconds later, my phone buzzed in my pocket. The smell of wolves were still thick. Enough that it made me wonder if they were still around. Alec walked up to the passenger side and I took the driver’s. I had prepared myself to see a dead Zac but instead, all I saw was blood. Pulling out my phone, I looked at the message Alec just sent.

Alec: Emmy’s water just broke Zac POV F uck! My f ucking head was pounding. By the sharp pain in my shoulder, I knew that it was out of place. Blood ran down my face as ! tried to open my eyes. “Is-is he alive?” One of the girls asked. Her f ucking timid voice annoyed the s hit out of me. “Yes! Get up! They are coming!” I felt one of them nudge my arm. “F uck!” I yelled as I tried to move. My foot was pinned down and I could hear vehicles approaching. “Run! Straight and ask for Colt.” I growled at them. “Colt? Why can’t you come?” The timid one whined. “Get going! He will protect you. F ucking leave!” I yelled at the girls. It did the trick as they took off. They only had a minute at most for a head start before headlights came up behind me. There was no playing dead and I wasn’t about to be taken hostage. มองเป She was the only reason I kept going. My entire life was about keeping Penny alive. Now she has Colt, I was keeping Cassie alive. Still, if I could save my daughter again, both Cassie and I would happily lay down our lives. “Come out and play dirtbag!” I was still trying to shake off the cobwebs from the crash. A crash I can’t remember why it even happened. “There he is.” A bight flashlight blinded me. “Where are the girls?” “F ucking your mom!” I laughed as I sat back against the seat. of my “Don’t you think you are funny.” One of them grabbed a fist full hair and yanked me out of the vehicle, but my foot was still caught. Letting go of my hair, he grabbed my leg and pulled on it hard, with one bignoveldrama

yank. My ankle popped out of the socket before going back in. GET IT NOW












###Chapter 342

“MOTHER F UCKER!” As soon as it happened, sharp pain ran across my face from being punched in the mouth. My mouth instantly filled with blood as dirt filled my nasal passage. “Where are the girls, Zac?” That voice sent shivers down my spine. “Gunther. How nice to see you again.” Smiling, I looked up at him. Dressed in his Sunday best. “Wish I could say the same.” Gunther crouched down so he was closer to eye level with me. “You have been a thorn in my side for far too long.” “What can I say?” Shrugging, I tried to sit up a little better. “Even co ckroa ches have a will to live.” “All c ockro ches are better off dead.” One of the rogues looking at me. There was a hint of fearlness behind his eyes that made him very dangerous to be around. All he wanted was blood and didn’t care who it came from.

“Even smashed co ckroa ches still live.” I responded. “Come on. Let’s go.” Gunther snapped his fingers and two pairs of hands grabbed my arms and ripped me to my feet. Gunther took off walking as I got drug behind him. Everything me told me I didn’t want to find out where I was being taken. Someone like me doesn’t get to be this old by making mistakes like this. However, I had one chance. There was three rogues and Gunther. That I could see anyway. Two were dragging me and another was to my right. Gunther was right in front of me. My ankle was throbbing and my shoulder was still not in place. That yovu far worst injuries and still got away. I had a safe house about twenty miles from here. It was really an abandoned hunting shed but it has saved me more than once. The biggest thing, there was an old bomb shelter under the stairs. I have been able to hide there and never be found. Thinking quickly, this was my moment. Gunther was on the phone. He had moved so far ahead that he was barely visible. The rogues were just walking, not exactly in the ready position.

It was like taking candy from a baby. My body went lip, forcing them. to st agger and drop me. Moving quickly, my claws extended. As the feral one grabbed me, my claws sliced across his neck. Blood shot out all over me as my body was grabbed from behind. Reacting on instinct, my head whipped back. Feeling the c rac k of a nose, I just took off. Running as fast as I could with a bum ankle. “Catch him!” I heard behind me. Now, this was fun. My laughter bounced off the leaves as I kept going. My wolf was fast. Even for our old age, my wolf was unbeatable. These trees were my safe place and my wolf knew them like the back of his hand. The sound of the horn grew quiet and eventually the footsteps faded away. Too many times I learned that slowing down is not helpful. A very pis sed off growl caused all the birds to fly up and away. “F uck you, Gunther.” I whispered as I kept going. Only looking back to see the birds. My chest was burning as I stopped running for a second. My arm was basically dangling and needed to be put back. It was like second nature to snap that back but f uck if I’d ever get used to the pain. Clenching my teeth together was the only thing they kept me from Jurning wis - Still, I didn’t stop for too long. As soon as the sharp pain stopped, I kept on running. As I got closer to my safe house, something in my gut told me something was wrong. This last mile, I barely walked on the first floor. Each step was calculated and slow. Inch by inch, I got closer when I found out why my internal bells were going off. “No one is here, boss.” A loud crunch of something wood breaking filled my ears. Peaking out from behind the bush, I realized I was made. noveldrama














###Chapter 343

“I didn’t expect him to be here. That would be too easy.” Vin was standing in my front yard with a cigar. “What do you want to do?” They didn’t smell like rogues. No, these were warrior or other wolves that have joined Vin and Gunther. “Burn it.” Vin said. “Easy enough.” The guy grabbed some twigs and dried leaves before using a lighter to lift them on fire. Setting it on the ground, just under a corner of the house that was broken out. noveldrama

It only took a few minutes as I watched what once was my safe house, to become ash. As it erupted in flames, Vin got bored. “Let’s go.” As my house burned, a fire burned in me. Vin and his gang of men, walked away. Wanting revenge and answers, I started followed them. Wrapping my hands around Vins neck would be fun but he would never break. No, I needed to go after one of his men. It was crazy how silent they were as they moved. Over my years of hiding, I had mastered that skill but these men were not very old. Expertly moving around bushes or fallen limbs, they were the complete definition of stealth. However, there was one man that kept looking up at the stars. He would pause for a second before starting up again each time there was a break in the trees. “Be at headquarters by 7am, no later.” Vin looked at his men before walking out of the tree line. Three cars were parked on an old abandoned road. I knew this road was here but it is so overgrown that I didn’t think anyone else knew it was here. If Vin knew about it, who else knew about it and about me? “Yes, boss.” They said in unison. Vin got into one of the cars and the others got into the rest. Luckily, the one I was watching got into his own vehicle, by himself. Quickly, I got undressed and shifted into my wolf as their engines started. Barely waiting for it to turn over, they got on their gas. My wolf wasn’t large by any means but he was fast. He was a lighter brown with dark brown spots, almost like a snake camoflauge. I was always in awe of how beautiful my wolf was, even though others

called him abnormal. They weren’t wrong but he blended in to his surroundings so good that more than once he wasn’t detected. However, chasing a car wasn’t easy. Even for a fast wolf, cars could go much faster. To make things worse, I had to stay in the treeline. Couldn’t risk getting caught by running right behind him r oven beside the tree line. There was a small little…. I wouldn’t say town but community that is. rarely visited by police. Humans might call this the ghetto but this was much worse. Here is where you will find the fight clubs, underground human trafficking and just basic drug locations. There is one bar that all of them come together and live in harmony. It is an unwritten rule that if you make trouble here, you die. Simple as that. Business is conducted here and the bar gets a cut. No one knows the actual owner but rumor is, everyone who has tried to find out, is now dead. The guy pulled up to an older looking victorian style house. Vines grew up the sides, the paint was chipping and the flowers on the porch were half dead. Shifting back into my human form, I watched him park on the street and walk up to his house. Unlocking the door, he went inside. Now, all I had to do was wait till he went asleep.









###Chapter 344

 Zac POV Finally, after three hours, this man was passed out on his couch. Watching from the window, he had downed an entire twelve pack and finished a little white line before his head fell back and he was asleep. Sneaking around to the back door, I was able to get in easily. The wood was so rotted out that one swift hip bump was all it took for the whole thing to splinter. Standing perfectly still, my ears searched for any sign of moment. Since there was one, I moved further inside. The house was trashed. Dirty dishes filled the sink. A layer of dust allowed footprints like Santa Claus as I went deeper inside. The mice weren’t even shy about running across the floor. Peaking around the corner, the guy had not even moved an inch. It was too easy to walk up to him. Thankfully, he was still passed out cold but since all my equipment was burned, I needed to search the house for rope or something. The hallway was just to my right. First door was a bathroom on the left. Razors, blackened spoons and needles were laying out beside a shoe lace but beside that was a little nasal spray. Not being able to help the smile that spread across my face, I picking up the Narcan and placing it my pocket, I kept going. Maybe after I kill him, this might be my new location to hide out in. noveldrama

As soon as I walked into the bedroom, my body froze. How I didn’t smell this before was beyond me. A man was tied up, naked and dead to the bed. By the looks of it, he has been dead for at least twelve hours but not more than twenty-four “Sorry, I need these.” I said as I untied him. There was a total of four different ropes and I even freed the man of the b all ga g at was in his quick look, I was able to find a knife and a 9mm with a full clip. There was a fresh box of rounds that I added before one more quick glance. There was no way in hell I was going to be carrying him so after getting the car keys from the table by

the door, I tossed the bag into the trunk. Just looking at this large man and trying to figure out how to get him where I needed was going to be difficult but I had a vision. Carrying him wasn’t a real option and it wasn’t like I had something to roll him on. So, grabbing one leg, I just drug his as s like a human Santa Claus. Thankfully it was so late at night or early in the morning that no one came out to see what all the noise was. More than once, his head hit against the pavement and then on the side of the car before he was finally in the trunk. “Never been more thankful for drugs.” I muttered and slammed the trunk shut. Getting behind the wheel, we drove back to my burning house. Da mn, I was getting old. There was no chair so I had to drag his as s out of the trunk and tied him to a tree. Dead weight is by far the heaviest thing in the world. As soon as I was set up, I had to take a break to catch my breath. A light layer of sweat covered my forehead. It’s been a long as s time. since I did this much physical activity. “Time to wake up.” I smiled as I administered the Narcan. “Wha-?” The guy instantly became aware of his surroundings even though his struggled to open his heads. “What’s going on?” Fighting against the ropes, he finally gave up and looked at me. “Hello.” I said as I crouched down. “You.” He said in an accusatory tone. “Ah! Yes, me!” Smiling, I held out my arms and nodded. “What do you want?” His eyes followed me as I picked up his knife. “Answerers.” I said simply. “I don’t have any for you. I just do what I’m told.” His eyes narrowed but never left the knife.








###Chapter 345

“You may need to find those answers and quickly.” I said as I walked towards him. Sitting down on the ground, I used the knife to cut off his shirt. “What does Gunther and Vin want with Penny?” “She is just paying for your crimes, old man.” Grabbing his nipple, the knife slowly started carving it off. His screamed echoed fell on deaf ears. Not even the birds cared. “Tanya said she took something from them.” I continued when his nipple was in my hand. “St upid bi tch. Do me a favor and just kill that parasite.” “Don’t like the boss’s mate?’ I asked “I don’t like anyone.” His breathing was slowing down. “I’m not going to ask a third time, what is Penny’s involvement in this?” “I. Don’t. Know!” He said through clench teeth. Sighing, it was time for the other nipple to go. “Do you know how many nerve ends are in the nipples? Hundreds of exposed nerves.” My voice was calm and almost sounded bored.

He tried kicking and thrashing but my hand didn’t miss. “F UCK!” “The reason I chose this place to sleep was not out of convince.” Standing up, I walked over to a piece of wood I had placed down. Using a random stick I kept by to lift the board, a smile crossed my face. “What’s over there?” He yelled. At the same time, I bent over and grabbed it. “Do you know what this is?” Dropping the board, I allowed him to see the animal close up. “A f ucking snake.” “Not just any snake, a Coral Snake. The venom attacks the nervous system before killing their victim.” Holding the snakes up to his face, I let him get a good look. “So, one bite and you will be in so much pain you will wish for death.” I said. “I’ll take my chances.” He said to me. noveldrama

“Okay.” Moving the snake to his freshly exposed tissue, the snake willingly bit down. “Holy f uck!” He screamed as the venom entered his body. “Good boy.” I said before putting the snake back. The man already had a layer of sweat on him. Grabbing a stick, I started carving it as the venom worked through his body. “Let me know when your ready to talk.” It took twenty minutes before I heard anything from him. “Just f ucking kill me.” “Tell me what I want to know.” I had made good progress on my snake carving. My signature I leave. If killing him here wasn’t enough, I’ll make it obvious. “All I know is Gunther is pi ssed the title didn’t get passed to him. He didn’t even know who Penny was. That shocked us all. Vin just wants Gunther to challenge her but Gunther wants blood. That is literally all I know.” Blood started falling from his mouth. Usually the venom doesn’t work this fast but for some reason, I wouldn’t have to kill him. “He just wants the title?” I clarified. “Yes, kill me!” He screamed as blood filled his throat. A few moments later, he his head rolled over. “S hit.” I wanted to send a message that Gunther needed to leave Penny alone. Since Penny gave Colt the title, I needed to do what I could to save Penny. She was my main concern. Colt wasn’t going to like this but I didn’t give a s hit. Taking the knife, I carved into his chest. Alpha Colt of Midnight. Since I ran out of room, I left it at that. Maybe Gunther will focus on Colt and leave Penny alone. She was just the Luna anyway and even if Colt lost, she could just reject Gunther. I’ll keep her safe. As I started walking towards Colt’s pack, my mind wondered. Colt had an ancient wolf. He could kill Gunther. It really was the best plan. Colt can fight and win. At the same time, laminating Gunther and Vin wouldn’t be hard for me to kill after. The boarder was just ahead when I heard something coming towards me. Darting behind a tree, a young woman came sprinting by me. She kept looking back in almost fright. My curiosity got the better of me. Changing courses, I followed her instead. At first I thought she was

running from someone but as I watched her. She was running towards someone and making sure she wasn’t being followed. GET IT NOW









###Chapter 346

The mood was still high in the sky but the night wasn’t far from being over. Sunday morning was coming quickly and this woman seemed both excited and scared. We walked for miles until it dawned on me where we were at. Part of me wanted to tell her she was headed towards the lions den but it almost seemed like she wanted to. Her foot steps never s taggered as she jogged every inch of the way. I had to stay behind so I couldn’t hear but I watched this woman walking into the arms of Gunther. My jaw hit the floor as he pressed his lips against her and slammed the door shut. Taking my chances, I slowly crept up to the window. Thankfully, it was partially open. “Why did you come?” Gunther asked “I needed to see you.” “I know. I miss you too but if we get caught, the whole plan will be ruined.” “You are my mate. Why can’t we just be together?” she started crying. “I told you why. For starters, Colt would never allow it. I’m not a good man.” Gunther walked away from her.

“You can be! I can help you.” “Can j gave you a task, have you done it?” Gunther looked at her. “N-nothing yet. I’ve tried but so far I haven’t been able to.” “He will kill you if you fail! You cannot fail!” He sounded like he truly did care about her. ww “What does he expect me to do? They aren’t weak wolves.” “Penny is only a Luna and a soft one at that.” Gunther waved her off. “No, she isn’t.” The girl looked at him weird. “What do you mean?” Gunther narrowed his eyes at her. “Penny never gave the title to Colt. They are both Alphas. I over heard them talking. Yes, they

combined packs but she kept the title.” My heart sank at hearing this. I made a huge mistake. My find instantly went to the guy that was probably being eaten right now. I’ll have to get to him before he was found. At this time, the sun was starting to peak up, over the trees. “This will be good. You can befriend her. Get her to open up and find what you need to.” Gunther sounded excited. “I can’t befriend her!” She looked at him like he was crazy. “I’m not made for this! I can’t do it.” Tears filled her eyes “You have to try. It’s the only way I will be able to get us out of this, alive.” Gunther pulled her into a hug. “I’ll try but I just don’t know.” “I’ll keep Vin off as much as I can but he wants blood and I’ll be dam n if it is your blood that is spilled so if you need to find a way to break into Colt and Penny’s office than you will do just that. Do you understand?” He looked at her as she nodded. “One day, when this is over, we will be able to leave and live together. The clock on the wall striked 7am. “I have to go. We had a meeting at 7am and the guys will be wondering why I’m not there. How did you sneak out?” “Emmy is having her baby. Her water broke so everyone is distracted by this.” “That’s perfect. Since they are distracted, find a way to sneak into their office.” Gunther looked excited. Grabbing his keys, he walked towards the front door. “Okay.” The girl looked more relaxed “I’ll text you, okay?” Gunther grabbed her waist and kissed her hard before letting her go. “Okay.” She watched him get into his car and drive off. She put her head down and started walking. “Where are you going?” I asked as I stepped out from behind the corner of the house. noveldrama










###Chapter 347

“Who are you?” The girl jumped a mile in the air as she turned quickly to look at me. “I….I know who you are! You are Penny’s dad!” Her hand covered her mouth as she took a few steps back. “That’s right. I am her dad and it seems like you are working against her.” I took one step forward. Now that I got a good look at the girl, I remember seeing her around the pack house. “What are you doing here?” “I should ask you the same thing.” Leaning against the porch post, I pulled out a cigarette. It was slightly broken so I had to pull part of it off before lightening it. “It’s not of your business why I’m here!” She tried hold her head high but she couldn’t hide the smell of fear. “So why are you asking me the same thing?” I joked and blew some smoke. “Though, I’m sure Colt will be very interested to know that his ex-girlfriend is mated to the man trying to kill his mate.” “We are not trying to kill Penny!” “Didn’t sound like it. Tell me, what is so important in their office that you want to steal for Vin?” “Like I said, none of your business!” She turned and started walking

away. As quickly and quietly as I could, I ran up behind her, grabbed her arm and pulled it behind her. “Don’t make me break your arm. Tell me what I want to know or this won’t be good for you.” “I won-” she started before I pulled a little more. “Okay!” It sounded like tears ran down her face. “So talk.” I whispered in her ear but didn’t let go. “Vin wants a mold of their office key and the blueprints to the new buildings that are going up.” “This is committing treason.” I wasn’t surprised with these demands. Vin has never been able to see the biggest picture. “I don’t have a choice! He will kill me. I don’t want to do this but I don’t want to die either.” “I’ll tell you what. If you do find a way into that office, I want to you tell me first. I’ll alter the papers sonoveldrama

Vin won’t have the actual layout and Colt and Penny are save but you won’t die either.” “You-you would do that?” She sounded surprised. Honestly, I wanted to know why he wanted these so bad and I wanted the information. Did he know something I didn’t? “Anything to keep my daughter alive.” Omitting my true intentions wasn’t harmful. She didn’t need to know everything. She was just a pawn and sometimes, pawns were needed to be sacrificed for the greater good. “Okay.” She said and I let her go. “You can’t tell Gunther about this.” I said, annoyingly nicely. “Why?” “What if Vin found out Gunther was going against him? That wouldn’t be good for Gunther. No, if you want to save Gunther and yourself, you can’t tell anyone about it. It has to be our little secret.” “To save Gunther…” it was like she was trying to wrap her head around it. “Exactly, so you can have a future together.” “Okay. I’ll do it!” She nodded her head and turned before running off. At this point, it was almost eight and they defiantly noticed that guys absence. I just hope I can get there before they do. Penny POV “Did she have the baby yet?” Colt asked as he came into our bedroom. “She did. A little girl, Aurora James.” I was finishing getting ready Colt came in. He just finished training with the guards and needed a shower. “How is she doing? Baby okay?” Colt nodded and started undressing as he walked to the bathroom. “I think she is doing good. I talked to her just a little bit ago. She is exhausted and hormonal. I think I’ll give her a day or so before we go visit. School starts not tomorrow but next Monday. That following Saturday will be Kris’s Luna ceremony. Since Emmy had the baby, Alec wanted to get it done. I am filling out invitations today for the mail tomorrow. I will be down at the shop for that since Kris has all the stuff there. I need to stop by our office and grab some stuff. Either way, I’ll be around so if you need

me, you will have to call but most of my day will be at the shop.” For this day I pullout out some maternity shorts. I didnt have a large bump but just looked bloated. However, ever since I woke up, anything tight on my stomach hurt and was extremely uncomfortable. GET IT NOW












###Chapter 348

“Are you okay?” Colt poked his head out of the bathroom and looked at me. I was standing in front of our mirror, shifting uncomfortably. “Anything on my stomach hurts. Like, I put on those jean shorts and I had to take them off. These are new maternity style but it still feels off.” “I got you something.” Colt had just his boxers on as he went into the closet, “I was saving this for the right moment and I think I found it.* “What is it?” I asked, not taking my eyes off my stomach. “Just look.” Colt held up a bag for me. Rolling my eyes, I grabbed the fabric and pulled it out. They were very relaxed, casual pregnancy dresses. Extra room for the stomach but was light and breezy. “These are perfect.” Pulling my shorts off, I grabbed a red, pink and white thick stripped one. It was sleeveless with a high neck, slits on both sides that ran up to my lower thigh and fit me like a glove. “I’m glad you like them. There are four in here but I can order more if you want. I’ve been reading some books and the warriors have been giving me some tips. They said these kind of dresses were game changers for their wives. It’s casual so you can dress it up or down. Hair can be up or down and you can still move your legs. I guess one wife tied the front in a knot because she was annoyed with how it moved when she walked.” Colt just watched me look at myself in the mirror. “I really like this. For some reason, I just don’t like anything tight on my stomach. This is probably the best solution.” noveldrama


“I feel like your bump really just grew over might. You look pregnant now.” “You think?” Moving to the side, I put my hands on top and bottom of my stomach. I could see what he was talking about. “You look amazing. I can’t believe my baby is in there.” Colt went to put his hand on my stomach but stopped and just rubbed my arms. “Why did you just do that?” I asked confused and a little hurt. “You actually don’t touch my belly much.”

“Do what?” Colt looked genuinely confused. “Not touch my stomach. It looked like you wanted to but stopped.” “You just said anything on your belly is uncomfortable. I didn’t want to do that.” “You can always touch our baby.” Grabbing his hand, I placed it right in the middle. “I think we are having a boy.” Colt kissed my forehead before kissing my stomach and walked to the bathroom. Grabbed some sandals, ! slipped them on. “Why so?” “Just a feeling I have.” Colt smirked at me and got in the shower. “As long as there isn’t two in there.” laughed. “Alright. I’ll see your later! Love ya.” “Bye! Love you guys!” I heard him yell from the shower. Living in this house has been a dream. It feels more private and personal. Still, I enjoyed the pack house but this just feels like a home. Colt has given me full creative freedom to redecorate or even to do minor construction. However, other than esthetics, I am happy with it. Getting into my car, I started driving to the shop. The window was comy picly youu, muyuu u vu would be good. Just the thought had my stomach rumbling. Someone else might want something so I’ll order when I get there for delivery. Last time I picked myself something up, I heard about it from everyone that came by the office so this time, I’m going to ask. Thankfully, Kris added some reserved parking for us when we came to the shop. Since it can get busy anymore, she needed to reserve some lots. “Hey, Penny!” Kris looked up from her station. She just hired some interns. I think one of their names is like Calvin or Brandon but for the life of me, I couldn’t remember it.







###Chapter 349
“Hey, Kris! How’s everyone today?” I said as I sat my stuff down. “I think we are doing pretty good.” Kris looked around. Everyone nodded in agreement. “I’m going to order Starbucks. Anyone want anything?” I asked as I pulled out my phone. “I’ll take a Chi Tea.” Kris yelled. “Anyone else?” “No, thank you.” “I’m good, thanks! “Just finished mine!” “Alright. One Chi Tea coming up.” I added a white chocolate mocha and an impossible breakfast sandwich. “Coming in thirty minutes.” I noveldrama

said as I set my phone down. Pulling up her computer, I started with printing out the labels. Knowing I needed the same people for me, I went ahead and double printed. This way, I don’t have to do this again. This was the most time consuming part so I got it going. By the time the printer stopped printing, the bell rang as someone walked in. “Hello! I have an order for Penny?” “That’s me!” I said as I took our drinks and my sandwich. “Perfect. You paid on the app so enjoy!” She waved as she walked out. “Here you go!” Walking over, I set Kris’s tea on the counter, outside of the sterile field. “Thank you so much.” She did a double take on my dress. “That looks “It really is. Colt got it for me and even got different colors. Anything on my stomach is really bothering me. This seems to be the best option. “I’m the opposite. Anything that moves across my stomach bothers me. I need right clothes that don’t more around.” Kris looked at her flat belly. There was what looked like some bloating but not as big as me. That really worried me as I made my way back to my seat. If there was more than one in there….

“What do you have to do to day?” Kris asked, pulling me out of my thoughts. “Finish these invitations for you. I… oh shoot. I forgot to stop by my office. I needed the details for the Halloween party. I’ll have to get those and finish calling the vendors.” “What is left on the invitations?” Kris asked. “Assemble them and put the labels. I’ll take them to my office and finish them. They can go out in our mail. I’ll finishing working in my office today.” “Okay. I can handle them if you need me too.” Kris looked worried. “Oh no! I set all day aside to work on this. If I remember to go to my office first, I would just be working here but I’ll just work there.” I was a little bummed because it would have been nice to get out of the office but I didn’t want to go to my office, get the supplies to come back here and the. Turn around and take it back to my office when I got finished. “Okay. Thank you for all your help.” Kris smiled at me. “Welcome!” Grabbing the boxes, I walked to my car and put them in before getting in the driver’s seat. Again, I kept the windows down as I NUJ TVHLUNU center, I was able to grab my boxes and walk inside. The pack house was unusually quiet this morning. Expect for one person. “What are you doing?” I asked shocked and a little thrown off. GET IT NOW










###Chapter 350

“I came to talk to you and Colt.” Zac was standing in front of our office door, smoking a cigar. “Colt, Zac is standing in front of our office door.” I said in the mind link. “We haven’t heard from you.” Unlocking the door, I pushed it opened and walked in. “F ucking serious? On my way.” Colt sounded pi ss ed. “There isn’t any cell reception in the woods.” Zac sat down. “There isn’t any smoking here.” Frowning, I watched him sigh and put it out on his pant leg. I would think that would hurt but he must be used to the pain. “Where is Colt?” “On his way. We weren’t sure if you were dead or not.” I kept all the emotion out of my voice. “I’m a c ockro ach.” He laughed like there was some inside joke. noveldrama

“Have you spoken to Cassie?” “I just did before coming here. Just to say hi. She looks good… healthier.” Zac looked around like he was uncomfortable. We both were. “She does.” “Zac.” Colt said as he came around the corner in a very annoyed tone. He was dripping sweat off his bare chest. Both Zac and I let out a breath that I don’t think either one of us realized we were holding. “Just the man I needed to talk to!” Zac put on a big smile, showing off his decaying teeth. “Where the f uck have you been? Sending girls to our doorstep without any explanation. Care to explain yourself?” Colt was standing behind his desk with his hands on his hips. “Doing what you asked! It’s not like I can call every minute.” Zac grumbled. “That was the f ucking deal. If you wanted to do this than you f ucking check in!” Colt was raising his voice to the point that the pictures shook on the wall. “I’m checking in now, ain’t I? Do you want to hear what I have to say ог not?” He crossed his arms over his chest.

“You better start talking.” Colt narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms over his own chest. “Went to an underground fight. Was able to save a girl. Then I got these girls out but Gunther spotted me. After crashing, I told the girls to run and I ran in a different direction to take them away. I outran. them and here we are. The only thing I figured out is they are really only after the title. Since Darin and Rip are gone, Vin wants it.” “So all you found out was they want a title that doesn’t exist. anymore.” Colt said through gritted teeth. “Which makes her Luna and you alpha. I planted a little bug about challenging you for the title. You can win easily.” “She still has the title Alpha.” Colt was barely containing his anger. “That is unfortunate…” Zac shifted uncomfortably. “Listen, maybe if you just challenge Vin and Gunther to a fight till death, we can avoid all this.” “Are you serious? I am a f ucking Alpha. If I challenged everyone who is not as powerful to a fight till death, I would be stripped of my title.” Colt slammed his fist down. “I can see tempers are high. There is another fight tonight. Let me see what I can find out? I’m saving those girls.” We still needed to question the girls. I watched as Zac got up and backed up to the door. “Is there anything else you need to tell me?” Colt asked, dangerously calm? “I told you everything.” Zac bowed but it felt like more of an insult than being respectful. “I wouldn’t want to find out otherwise.” Colt said as Zac practically ran out of here. “That was enlightening.” I said as Colt shut the office door and locked it. “He’s lying.” Colt sighed and sat down on his chair. “That was obvious even without us already knowing the truth.” Sighing, I went to my desk and pulled out the invitations. “We can’t assume we know everything.” Colt came up to me and looked over my shoulder. “I thought you were working at the shop today.”









###Chapter 351

“I was but I forgot to come here and get the stuff I need to finished the Halloween party. So, I decided to just finish working here today.” “That actually works out. We were about finished with my stuff. Alec will be over in about an hour or so to question the girls. I was going to go pick you up but since you are here..” “I thought that was on the agenda for tomorrow?” “One of them has something to say apparently.” “Well, I suggest you go shower and be down here when Alec gets here.” I said without looking up at him. “Can’t question them like this?” Colt held out his arms. Looking up, he was smirking at me. “No.” I said deadly serious. “Are you getting jealous?” Colt kneeled down and turned my chair to look at him. “No. Would you like me to wear low cut shirts and show off just how much my boobs have grown?” I threw it back at him. “I would tie you to the bed.” Colt narrowed his eyes. noveldrama

“That’s an interesting idea.” Leaning forward, my fingers traced down. his cheek to his chest. Little bumps followed my finger as I traced his muscles. “However, you need to go shower.” Giving him a soft kiss, I turned back around. “Not going to jump me?” Colt asked, almost disappointed. “Nope. We have people coming over, I am actually feeling rather comfortable and I’ll save it for later when your not so sweaty. I would prefer if we got sweaty together.” Colt move behind me and put his head just behind mine. His hot breath tickled my ear. “You’re lucky your pregnant and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable or I’d bend you over this desk and f uck you.” His voice has a deep edge to it that made me close my legs. A sudden desire shot through me and almost won but Colt leaned up and walked to the door. I was still

struggling with calming myself down when he smirked at me and left. I couldn’t stand up quick enough and walk over to the wall to turn the fan on. I was hot and needed the air. Going back to my desk, it was all I could do to focus on these are invitations. After labeling and putting stamps on them, I set them in the outgoing pickup for tomorrow. There was a knock on the office door just as I was about to sit down. My mind started wondering,hoping it was Colt standing here, naked but I was greeted by Alec. “Hey.” Turning around, I let him see himself in. Pretty much ignoring him, I went back to my desk and sat down. “How’s it going?” Alec asked as he awkwardly walked over. “Good. Just finished with your invitations.” I nodded to them. He followed my movements and saw them. “Thank you for doing that.” “Anything to help out.” Pulling out the Halloween stuff, Alec looked at a few pictures I had printed. “This is…” “Too scary for you?” I gave him a look. He was actually looking at one of my gross displays. It was a skeleton with pastrami as skin. The body had pastrami on the bones and the rest was a massive skeleton charcuterie board. “No. I just won’t be able to look at you the same way.” “What? Why?” I asked, slightly hurt. “I assumed you were more of the cute Halloween theme person. In reality, you are the dark side. “I love my horror shows. Maybe I’ll be cute next year.” I said and laughed. Colt walked in and spotted us. “How’s it going?” They shook hands before giving a hug. “Good. Looking at her inspiration pictures.” Alec help up his scary skeleton. “That will definitely make a statement.” Colt raised his eyebrows at it. “You boys have no vision!” I growled and ripped the paper out of Alec’s hand.

“Eleanor is coming up.” Colt said quickly. Together, they walked to Colt’s side. GET IT NOW












###Chapter 352

“What did she want to say?” Alec asked. “No idea. Just that she wanted to talk and she wanted to talk to Penny.” “To me?” I asked as I got up and walked over to them. Colt was sitting in his chair but got up and allowed me to sit down. “Yeah. Personally I think it is because they still see you as their Alpha.” Colt shrugged. “Or because you are a girl, Helps you have a reputation for being soft and caring.” Alec chummed in. “Soft?” It didn’t sit right. “Are you going to pinch some to put them in their place?” Alec asked, “I could.” Crossing my arms, I knew I sounded like a baby but I didn’t care. “Okay.” Alec was saved by a knock on the door. After opening it, he stepped to the side and allowed Eleanor to be brought in.. “Thank you for seeing me.” She looked better as she was cleaned up and has eaten. “Of course. How are you feeling?” I asked. “Getting there.” She looked down at her hands. She was picking at her

nails, like she was nervous. “What did you want to discuss?” I had to asked awhile a moment of silence. “I-I….” Eleanor struggled to get her words out. “I am willing to discuss will you, li momdomy unijny. “What do you think will help us?” I asked. The guys moved around to the back so it was more of a conversation and not an interrogation. “I’m not sure by you can ask me anything and I’ll try to help and remember. I was drugged a lot so my memory is not the best. I just know Vin needs to die so I’m willing to do whatever.”

“You keep saying Vin. What about Gunther?” I asked. “He’s not a good man but he never visited me.” “Tell me what your life was like.” I asked “Well, my story is different than most. Usually, from ages birth to five, they went to a very structured daycare. Everyone had to attend, no questions. From five to fourteen, they do all the. Cleaning, cooking or any chores given to them. Once they hit puberty, they started being used to produce more kids. Boys got out into training camp and girls were assigned a room. Once you turned eighteen, you were forced to reject your mate.” da “Did you ever walk or overhear any conversations when you were cleaning?” I asked. “I did, a few times. Vin was taught to fight but didn’t have a head on his shoulders. More than once I would overhear him talk about going to a secret building or hideout. It would talk about it being in the woods.” “Do you know where?” I asked “No, just at it was th “Who was the gam ma? I know Steven was the Beta.” “Cash was the Beta.” “Do you know if he is still alive?” I asked. “No. He died before I got sold.” Ignoring that for now, “What was Gunther’s role in the pack?” “Just a warrior. He didn’t have one but then again, something might have changed since I was sold.” “Why were you so shy when Sherry saw you?” I asked. “I didn’t know if she blamed me or not.” “For what?” I asked, confused. “I killed her mate. That is why I was sold. He was killed him. So, Alpha Rip sold me as punishment.

“She has a mate here…” I said in a whisper. — you know and I “It would have to be a second chance mate. She might be too embarrassed to tell people that. I would be. Her mate was not a nice person.” “Who was her mate?” I asked. “Cash.” “You killed Cash?” I asked, shocked. “Well, halfway. Gunther did the heavy lifting, I just finished it.” She looked at me so matter-of-factly. “What was Gunther in it for?” noveldrama












###Chapter 353

“He always said women were too far below him. “As cruel as he could be, he never really liked abuse for the fun of it. Cash was… well Gunther walked in and saw. He had Cash by the neck. Cash was getting ready to gut Gunther so I took a knife that was on the floor and sliced Cashes neck. Gunther said he would take care of it. Next thing I knew, I was being sold.” “Did Sherry ever say anything to you about it?” I asked, still wrapping my head around it. “No. First time I saw her was when you were there.” “Have you spoken to he here?” I clarified. “Oh, no. She just asked if I was okay!” Eleanor looked down at her hands. The office went quiet for awhile, absorbing what she just said. “Should we confront Sherry?” I asked Colt in the mind link. “They are on their way.” Colt said, immediately. “Did you ever hear about Vin wanting to take over?” “Not particularly. He wanted to be the top dog. He probably left the building, hoping they all died so he could take over. He would say, “if I was alpha’ and try to throw his weight around.” There was a knock on the door that made Eleanor jump clear out of her skin. “It’s okay.” I said as Colt opened the door. Jacob and Sherry walked in. I couldn’t help but see anxiety spread across Sherry’s face.

“Sherry, please have a seat.” Colt said. “Jacob, you stay over here.” “What’s going on?” Sherry’s voice shook as she talked. “Sherry. I need to ask you some questions. We are trying to gather voice. “O-okay?” round, mumy my Lunu “Please tell us your life before finding Jacob.” I asked.


“I-I was a sl ave. Mainly cooking and cleaning until I was sold to those guys that Colt and Alec killed.” “Why were you sold?” I pushed. “I wasn’t useful anymore so they got rid of me.” Sherry kept dancing around the subject. “It wasn’t because you’re mate died?” I asked. Sherry looked at Eleanor like she betrayed her. “WHAT?” Jacob asked. He tried to take a few steps forward but Colt and Alec stopped him. “Why does it matter?” Sherry looked at me angerly. This was a very different then the shy Sherry. “Because omitting is still lying. You know more than you originally told us.” I kept my voice and face passive. “Women were nothing. I was kept in our room until she killed him. Then I was useless and I was sold. Before I was at least only abused by one man and because of her, I was given to more men.” Eleanor jumped up and backed away. “He was torturing me!” Tears threatened to falls. Still, her face held strong. “You and everyone else. He was still my mate. At least I responded to him. After awhile, he wasn’t that bad. He-he even was nice sometimes.” Sherry pleaded. I’ve heard of Stockholm syndrome but I hadn’t actually seen it till now. Her eyes looked at me, hoping would understand. “Who the f uck were you mated to?” Jacob asked, clearly mad. “Cash.” Sherry looked at him. “Cash… as in ga mma Cash that we met in Kristen’s shop?” Jacob looked at Colt. “Yes.” Jacob looked at Sherry like she betrayed him. I felt horrible, knowing their relationship was going to be on the line. More than once, he opened his mouth and closed it again before storming out of the office. Colt followed him. Alec stood by the door. Keeping the link open between Colt and I so he could hear, I continued. “Did Vin ever come to talk to Cash?” I continued. noveldrama

“Yes. None of that matters now. Cash is dead.” Sherry got comfortable in the chair and put her face in her hands. GET IT NOW














###Chapter 354

“What did they talk about?” “I don’t know. Mostly about some place in the woods they did things at.” “What did they do at this place?” I pushed. “I don’t know. I just heard them schedule meeting times.” Sherry shrugged. “Did it ever occur to you that Vin was going to continue his plans even with Cash gone?” I asked. “I don’t even know their plans were. For all I know, they were to just planning what girls to hurt. Vin was going to hurt people, with or without Cash and regardless of what I knew or didn’t know wasn’t going to change that.” “Alec and Colt can go look for that house. It could have saved lives. There could have been information there!” I was getting annoyed at her lack of awareness. “When I found Jacob, I promised myself that the past is the past. I wasn’t going to go down that road and wonder what could have been. Jacob has provided me a future to be proud of.”


“You are confined to your bedroom until Colt or I tell you otherwise. You are prohibited from doing any Beta activities also.” I said. “Seriously?” Sherry looked shocked. “Until this mess is situated and the house has been found, yes. You should be more worried about your relationship with Jacob.” Sherry stood up and gave me one last look before walking out. Alec “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to cause any drama.” Eleanor said. “You didn’t. You just helped uncover the truth. Can you think of anything else that might help?” I asked. “Not right now. I’ll keep thinking.” She looked nervously at the door. “What is it?” I asked.

“I know she is in her room but I’m afraid about what will happen if she sees me in the hall.” “You can go to Alec’s pack.” I said as I looked at him. He nodded as she looked at him. “His mate and mine are twins. I can assure you, you will be very safe there.” “Can I still volunteer at your school programs? Eleanor asked with worry in her voice. “Of course you can. A bus travels from his pack to school and you can ride that.” Giving her a sweet smile, she nodded in response. “If I may be excused, I’ll pack a bag.” Eleanor went to stand but stopped herself. “Of course. If you think of anything else, you can tell Alec or Kris. Here is my card and you are always welcome to call me.” Eleanor stood up and took the card. “Thank you.” She bowed before timidly walking past Alec. “You can bring Jacob back.” I told Colt in the mind-link. He didn’t respond but I knew he heard me. “I think you handled that good.” Alec said after a moment. My eyes met his. After failing to find some falseness, I allowed that to sink into my bones. “Good, thank you.” I said as Colt pushed Jacob “The f uck, man?” Jacob jerked away from Colt as he was fuming. “I’m sorry, Jacob. I wasn’t going to keep that from you. You had a right to know. If Sherry was going to tell you that, she would have done so in private.” I said to him. Jacob snapped his head over me to. His eyes were black. Colt moved to stand behind me. “You think I am going to hurt my Luna? A pregnant one at that?” Jacob looked hurt. “No. I think you are feeling very emotional right now and sometimes our actions aren’t ours.” Colt said as he motioned to a chair. “What am I suppose to do now?” Jacob ignored Colt and started pacing. “I don’t think she meant to hurt you. She was embarrassed. She has Stockholm syndrome, Jacob. You have shown her what a healthy relationship looks like. She is going to need time and therapy but I think she is coming around…. Or will.” I tried to sound calm in hopes. he would match my energy. noveldrama










###Chapter 355

“You want me to go up there and lay next to the women that has lied to me for weeks?” Jacob looked at me like I was st upid. “When did I say that? Stop being st upid Jacob. You and I both know you can stay in another room. You can reject her or just get space. Believe it or not, you are not the most important piece of information we got. Your relationship isn’t even on my radar. Sherry and Eleanor told us about a house in the woods. One that Cash and Vin would visit. She didn’t know for what but if there is information that could have saved Kristen or let us know what is going on now, she will be held responsible.” “This went to s hit, fast.” Jacob put his hands on his head and kept pacing. “Don’t do anything yet. Why don’t you pack a bag and stay in another room. Let’s find that house and figure out if it even means anything. Take a day or two and wrap your head around this.” Colt said simply. “Fine.” Jacob put his arms down and looked at Colt. “This was f ucked up to tell me like this.” “Would you have reacted differently had o told you in private? Or would you have stormed away from me and threaten Sherry to tell you the truth? That would have made you the bad guy in this situation. If Sherry was going to tell you, she would have. We had to force her to tell the truth and you say for yourself she still tried to lie.” Colt sighed.

“Going to get a bag.” Jacob walked away from us. Alec allowed him to pass. Jacob shut the door, maybe a little too hard. “I confined Sherry to her room.” I told Colt. “Okay but I would rather you not work here till this gets figured out. Between Zac and Sherry, it would be better if you worked from home.” “We don’t have a guard there. How am I safer there than here?” “She can work at my place.” Alec said. noveldrama

“Um, school starts soon. I have too much stuff to do to be spending time in another pack. I need to make sure they are staffed and have the supplies they need. I’ll be in and out for the next two weeks.” “Jasper just had a baby…” Colt said. “I’ll stay behind and guard her. Jacob will need you to control him plus you know everything. That way, I am here for when you get back.” Alec volunteered. “You sure?” Colt asked “Yeah. Kristen might even tag along.” He looked like it was no big deal. “Great, you have guard duty when there isn’t even a threat on my life. Wear tennis shoes.” Alec raised the corner of his lip. Was he trying to smile, if he was, this was very rare. “Yes, ma’am.” “Great. That’s settled.” Colt sighed. “I’m going to head home. Eleanor is coming with me. She doesn’t want to be around Sherry.” “Can’t blame her.” Colt gave him a look. “Thanks, man.” “Anytime.” Alec said as he walked out. “I know this isn’t ideal but it would give me piece of mind. No one is more dangerous than someone that feels cornered. Truth is, we don’t know what she is capable of.” “It’s fine. It’s not going to stop these project from happening.” I said, stubbornly. “I would imagine not.” Colt laughed. “I have a surprise for you.” Colt said. “Oh, what’s that?” I asked, curious. “I got a call and Cassie’s house is ready.”









###Chapter 356

 Colt POV “You look like you haven’t slept these last two days.” Just looking at Jacob, his eyes were sunken, he was quick to anger and he was even fidgety. “I think you mean three days.” Jacob rolled his eyes at me. It was in fact Thursday. The last three days have been a bust. There was no direction to go on so we have been mapping out sections and going through them with a fine tooth comb. My warriors were searching as well but still, we have come up short Ice’s luna ceremony was in two days, so Penny has been working around the clock to make sure everything is perfect for her. This was a different view on things. Growing up, I knew Ice had assistants and I saw how much she worked to get things done. However, I never once thought about all the work Penny put into it. Now, the front row seat to her craziness has shown me exactly how hard she truly works. Never once does Penny complain. Exactly the opposite, she does it without even thinking about it. She never is tired or complained once. Lately, I’ve struggled with the idea of wanting her to slow down and relax more but she seems to enjoy this. On minimal, I will have a talk with Ice about doing the same for Penny’s ceremony. “I’m surprised you even knew the difference.” I tried joking with him. Jacob just looked at me like I was st upid.

“What do you want me to say?” Jacob sighed and faced the woods but I don’t think he saw anything. “The truth. How are you handling things? I know that was a blow but like Penny said, we don’t think it was meant to hurt you.” We both truly believed that. Did she omit things… yes. Did she lie to us and because she is hiding something to help them… no. “I don’t know. Like, I knew she wasn’t a virgin and it honestly took me a long time to get her to relax around me. Even to comfortably hold my hand was a struggle. I completely understood and never once did I push it. We both had to learn to adapt to what the other person needed but I thought she told menoveldrama

everything. I thought she spilled all her secrets to me in private.” “Jacob, have you even spilled all your secrets to her?” I gave him a look. I was ready to call b ulls hit on anything but no. “That’s not the same. I never had a mate before her.” Jacob bent down and picked up what looked like a T.V. remote but it was covered -in mud. “She couldn’t help what the Moon Goddess gave her. Probably why she was so scared when she found you at the party and Darin came out. He knew she was once mated to his gamm a and then she got another ga mma at his rival. He would have never allowed her to be given to us if she knew anything.” Trying to reason with him might be futile but I was going to try. “Or he thought she would never say anything because of fear.” “Regardless, you can’t live on what if. Has she started therapy?” I didn’t want to push but I needed my beta back. “I made her start the next day. They have had two, two hour sessions.” Jacob nodded his head as he kicked around some leaves. “ALPHA!” I heard one of my warriors yell out from my right. “Come on.” Slapping him on the chest, we jogged over to where my warrior was standing. He was looking at an old Victorian style home. Wooden boards covered the windows, paint was almost completely gone and the entire house looked like it was leaning, slightly to the “Everyone stay here. It looks unstable.” I commanded as Jacob and I walked up to his. First, we walked around the entire house. A basement window was broke but I doubt even Penny could fit through it. Inanimate objects were sc attered around the yard to the point it could pass for an actual junk yard but with trash. A chair here and a broken bedframe there. Everything had a covering of vines that told me it had been awhile. since anything here was placed.







###Chapter 357

The back door squeaked as Jacob slowly opened it. “S HIT!” Jacob yelled and jumped back as a racoon ran through the door, between his legs and into the woods. “Little jumpy?” I couldn’t hide my smile but I did have to bite the inside of my cheek to avoid laughing. “F uck off.” Jacob said as he walked inside. Walking inside, we were in a little nook off the kitchen. There must have been a table here at one point but now there was chains attacked to the wall. They were high enough that my over six foot frame had to stand on my tip toes just to reach them. Jacob kept going as he walked into what looked like a living space to the left. There wasn’t a T.V. but a fireplace that sat against the far wall. Two couches faced eachother with huge coffee table in the middle. Each couch had a stained white sheet over them but pressed down like they have been sat on. Brown smear marks confetti the sheets. Someone either had residual blood on them or they were bleeding themselves. The layer of dust that coated everything. However, looking down, there was some footsteps imprints that made me believe someone

has been here recently. “Look.” I said to Jacob and pointed down. Our eyes followed them to the next room. You could either take a left or so straight into a spiral staircase. “I’ll go up, you look down here.” “Okay.” Jacob turned and kept going as I went up the stairs. Each step creaked like I was going to find out what was under these stairs at any moment. So when I reached the top, a breath I didn’t realize I was holding came out. Ubor in the tiniest landing. Other than a dead flower in a pot, a window over looked the front yard. My warriors were standing around, just looking for threats. Some were talking quietly but most kept looking behind them. Never once did my alpha sense go off that something wasn’t right, so opening the door, I looked inside. This must have been a bedroom but it was converted into an office. A single desk stood in the middlenoveldrama

of the room. The desk itself was not impressive. It looked like a fancy four person table that they just moved from the nook to up here. A lap with a red shade was in the corner of the desk with papers sc attered around the desk and the floor. There was a couch against the wall but this one didn’t have a sheet. What it did have was a women’s clothing and only one shoe. Not wanting to focus on that, I went over to the desk. Shifting things around, there was a little black box. Holding it up, it looked like a device you can use to make copies of keys. Blueprints were on the bottom. Pulling those out, it looked like the building that Ice was taken to. Alec and I blew that f ucker up so that didn’t seem important anymore. Still, I was a little irked we didn’t have this before. This could have saved us so much. There was a hand sketched blueprint of my pack and Alec’s. It showed where the tunnels were and the time line from when they were working on it. All stuff I should have had before. Now it just seemed useless. Still, maybe Ice would see something I didn’t. She usually did. Gathering everything into a pile, I kept looking around to make sure nothing was missed. Right as I was about to leave, a picture caught my eye. It was leaning. against the wall, on the floor. The picture looked like it was hand sketched with charcoal. The paper looked worn and brownish but it was of the wolf that really caught my attention. It wasn’t exactly a match to the one in my office but it was similar. Not sure why my heart started racing but as I picked the picture up, my eyes went to the lower right corner. The signature, Adalynn was finely written in elegant cursive. This was one of my mother’s drawings. GET IT NOW






###Chapter 358

“Colt, you should come see this!” Jacob yelled from down the stairs. “Coming.” I said back. Tucking the picture under my arm, I gave this room one last glance before heading down the stairs. “Most of the house is bare. There is evidence someone has been here but nothing much. There is empty toilet paper rolls, cigarette buds that seem fresh with a new pack beside it and clothes that don’t have any dust on them. Blood but not dust.” “What do I need to see though?” I asked. Surely, he didn’t call me down for clothes. “Over here.” He walked around the corner and there was a staircase leading down. Why is it always the basement? No idea but Jacob walked down into the basement like it was nothing important.

“Is there a light?” I asked as I followed him down. The stairs, themselves were wooden ones with no back. My love for horror movies was not helping as I just pictures someone reaching threw them and grabbing my ankle, or taking a knife and cutting my Achilles tendon. “Yeah, over here but you need to stand right here to get the full affect.” Jacob moved me just to the right of the stairs before walking into the darkness. “Ready?” “Obviously.” I said, clearly unamused. Jacob flicked the lights on. My breath was caught in my throat as the realization of what I was looking at absorbed in my brain. Three different cubbies were open with only a mattress and a chain sticking out from the wall. At the end of each chain was a metal dog collar. Needles lined the walls with blacken spoons, lighters and other drug “I think this house was used as a location to sell the girls. We would have to ask Eleanor but look, there is no way out. Other than those tiny windows, the only way out of here is up the stairs. Over here, there is holding cells.” Jacob walked around and pulled back a sheet. There was a massive cage with benches against the walls. Similar to what you would see in a police station. In the middle was anoveldrama

shower head, pointed straight down. Water suddenly came out of it. Looking over, Jacob had turned a k nob so water came out and turned it back to shut the water off. “So they placed all the girls in there. Either showered them all or one of them at a time to their demand and then moved them to these viewing centers. I would guess they either tried their product out or just went off looks.” “That is my guess.” Jacob just looked at the fresh water on the floor. “There is an office up stairs that had a couch. I would guess that they would test out the girls to see if they would be good to be sold or if it was best to kill them. I would put money that if we searched the ground, we will find multiple bodies.” Looking around, this looked to be a secret place to do business that was not in their pack grounds. “Why not do it at their packhouse?” Jacob seemed to be following my thoughts. “Vin and Cash might have been doing this on the side.” I guessed. “Or we are missing something entirely.” Jacob frowned and looked around. “I hate to say it but maybe we need Ice to put her brain to the test.” Last thing I wanted to do was bring my sister out here but if we were missing something, we should know about it. “Did you find any surveillance?” Jacob asked me.









###Chapter 359

“No. I didn’t.” It felt strange but I knew when to call it. Pulling out my phone, I hit Alec’s number. “Yeah?” Alec answered after the first ring. “We found the house but I need Ice to look at it.” There was a loud silence on the other end before some murmuring.” Hello?” Ice’s voice came on the phone. “Hey, sis. I found the house but something just isn’t adding up. Can you come look at it?” “I’m in my sweats and have a bowl of ice cream.” She sounded unimpressed. “Please?” “Umm…” “Fine, what will it cost me?” I asked. Sometimes having a sister is exhausting, even if we are twins. “A homemade meal made by you.” “You’re pushing it.”

“I’m hanging up now.” She balled my bluff. “Fine. Just get out here.” Hanging up on her I air dropped my location. before sliding it into my pocket. “I take it she is coming.” Jacob didn’t even look at me. “Yeah, she is.” “Alpha! Look at this.” A warrior called from the other side of the There was a group of three men standing around, looking at the ground. Walking up, there was a man’s face sticking out of the ground. “He wasn’t buried deep. I tripped over his face.” A warrior said. “Uncover him.” He wasn’t even that bad looking. I would say probably has been dead for maybe five days. The more they uncovered him, the more I didn’t like what I saw. His chest was bare but the words’ Alpha Colt of Midnight’ and very cruedly. I had to turn my head a little to even read it. Maggots had started eating away at his stomach.

“Get him back to our morge. I want a full workup of him.” I commanded. My men bent down and started working on getting the decaying man back to our morge. “Where are you?” I heard my sister’s shriek all the way over on the other side of the house. “I’m here.” Jogging back around so she didn’t see the dead man. As I came around, I saw all three of them. “I didn’t realize everyone was coming.” I said as I walked up. Bending down, I kissed Penny on the cheek. “You wanted me to watch Penny and I wasn’t sending Kristen out here without someone so here we are.” There was a gater parked just inside the treeline. Alec just shrugged and crossed his arms over his chest. “You drug me here. What do you want?” Ice was looking at me like she was bored. “What you are going to see in that house is not humane. You need to prepare yourself.” Penny slipped under my arm as I looked Kristen in the eyes. I needed her to understand that this might be upsetting. W | “Your men are carrying a dead body…” She looked around me. had a feeling this wasn’t going to be filled with unicorns and rainbows.” She rolled her eyes at me and walked around me to the house. “You can stay out here if you need a break.” I mumbled to Alec. He snorted and took off after her. I watched them walk around the house until they came back to the front and went inside. It annoyed me that my men didn’t try to hide the body but I never did say to do that so I could exactly be mad at them.. “Are you okay?” Penny asked. Looking down, she was looking up at me with so much concern that my heart sank. “Yeah. That is like a house of horrors for women.” Squeezing her tighter, she just wrapped both arms around me and buried her head in my chest. “Why did you send Kris in there, then?” noveldrama

“She sees things that the average person cannot. I need to make sure I am seeing this location correctly. She might see something that I over looked.” GET IT NOW














###Chapter 360
“I knew that. I mean, why did you send her in there to allow her to see how women were probably tortured and killed? Would you ask me to go in there?” “F uck no. You will never step food in that house.” I was aware of the double standard that was going on but I couldn’t help it. My sister was not the same as my mate. Thankfully, Penny didn’t question it further. Instead, we watched Kristen move from room to room by the windows. Eventually, we stopped seeing her and I knew she was down in the basement. Did I like having to send her in there? Not in the slightest but there was so much riding on this. My phone rang in my pocket. Without even looking at who it was, I answered it. “Alpha Colt.” “I’ll never get used to hearing that.” My back instantly straightened as I stepped away from Penny. “Stay with Jacob, I need to take this.” I whispered to her before

walking away. Kristen POV Colt wasn’t lying. This house of horror was a woman’s nightmare. Walking into the kitchen nook, I was instantly greeted with chains on the wall. By the little indents in the drywall, many women were kicking. My mind went into investigation mode and I never even allowed myself to feel. It was like a switch. Shutting down, I could compartmentalize what I was seeing and feeling. Alec absolutely hated when I did this because he couldn’t feel my emotions. Without ume redumy me. Which, as I went around, he stayed right behind me. Looking around some but mainly watching me. Fortunately, he stayed in the doorways so I could get some space to really learn. There was so much to this puzzle and the fact that Colt even asked me to do this was huge. The footsteps were two different sizes. Which mean, two different people. By the side of each foot, it was two men that had been here. At first glance, it looked like a basic house that was used to hide out.

in. Maybe bring the random girl to torture and eventually kill but I was wrong. As soon as we hit the basement, it made the whole upstairs change. The three rooms were perfectly placed so viewing would be possible. What I noticed more was the staining. Each mattress had sunken spots that really made me look at it. “What are you doing?” Alec asked and grabbed my arm. I had taken at few steps inside one of the rooms. “Stand right there.” I pointed to an area just blow the stairs. Carefully lowering myself on the mattress, I put my butt where the indent was. This position made it possible for the person on the mattress to lean up against the wall. Without laying down. “Come sit down here.” I pointed to another sunken spot. Alec moved to the mattress. He had to reposition himself a few times. before he fit comfortably in the space. “Like this?” “With you in that position, it was almost like….” My voice trailed off as I looked around. There was so much drugs paraphernalia around the floor that most wouldn’t even question these room. “What?” They spent some time in these positions. This would be the perfect position for you to shoot me up.” Holding out my arm, Alec was able to grab it and act like he was inserting a needle. “This also allows someone to be watching.” “Like they were training people on how to do it?” Alec asked. way over “Maybe like they were training people how to handle the women they buy?” Shaking my head, I wasn’t sure but I was done sitting here.” Help me up.” Alec got up and took my hands. We made our to the other side of the basement. The sheet was pulled back, exposing the holding cell. The floor was still wet so I assume Colt had found the switch. “What are you thinking?” Alec asked.noveldrama












###Chapter 361

“I don’t really know.” We started walking upstairs. Going to the front door, I stood in front of it. “From this point of view, everything looks nice. A flower in the vase over there. Picture on the wall over here. Almost welcoming. The most direct route to the stairs, everything is still looking presentable. Fully furnished rooms. Less dust in those rooms like they actively worked on cleaning that area.” Alec followed me. “Then you get to the grand staircase. Under this dust, the wood is polished and preserved. The carpet on the stairs is in good condition. Nothing is torn or even worn down. Reaching the landing, there is al nice flower. Again, welcoming. This was designed to make a woman. feel at lease.”

“I can see that.” Alec agreed.

“Then you get to this office room. Judging by this couch, this is where they initially attacked. See how they nailed the legs to the floor? So it wouldn’t move around on them. It was like they brought them up here. to interview them or something. Maybe even gave them a water or tea that was laced with a drug.”

“Then taken to the basement.”

“Yeah. This was more of a side business than anything. Vin might have lost so many clients when Cash died. He could want to get Penny as a major f uck you to them. A ‘I still can do this without Cash’ kind of thing. Maybe Vin wants to sell Penny to get started up again. Those clients probably lost all confidence in him since everyone is gone and he is building up his reputation.” noveldrama

“That is an interesting theory.” Alec nodded but he was looking up at the ceiling.”

“What are you looking at?” I asked.

“There was a window at the top of the house. It was circular with a flower in stained glass. It isn’t in this room.”

“You think there is an attic?” I started helping him. “Most times, there is a ladder that is in the closet.” I said as I started opening the doors. The second try, I found it. It wasn’t big at all, typical from what your would have seen when this was built. However, there was a rectangle cut out on the ceiling.

“Find it?” Alec came up behind me.

“I did.” I said as I stepped aside. Alec grabbed the little string and pulled down. Dust and who knows what else fell down on his head but so did a ladder. “That is a tiny hole.”

“I don’t think I will fit.” Alec tried to take a step on the ladder but the bottom step broke in half.

“Lift me up.” I said.

“Hell no.” Alec looked at me like I was st upid.

“What? We need to look in there.”

“You could fall through the floor!” Alec pointed to the broken ladder. step.

“It’s a good thing you are good at catching me.” Patting his arm, I moved around him. I knew he wasn’t happy but instead of fight me and losing, he just put his hands on either sides of my hips and made. sure I was okay.

Taking one step at a time. They all cracked as I went. My feelings. were still turned off but I could bet that Alec was s hitting bullets at this point. Finally, I reached the top.

“Do you have a flashlight?” I asked. “On your phone?”

“Yeah.” Alec reached down and pulled out his phone from his pocket.

At first glance, it was a basic attic. Lose installation was laying across the entire floor but so were many cardboard boxes. No eyes. greeted me so that made me feel better. I did not want to come face to face with a bat.

“I’m going in.” I told Alec.

“Do you have to?” Alec groaned but it fell on deaf ears. He knew I was going to do this regardless.

“Yes.”

###Chapter 362

As soon as my feet hit the floor, it was like a heaviness that filled the air. The more I moved the flashlight around, the more uneasy I started to feel. Exposed wires lined the walls, marking on the wood ceiling were more like witch craft than kid drawings. Boxes were shoved in the corner. There was only a few in total but they were rather large. Thankfully, they weren’t taped so opening. them was easy enough. Spiders had made them their home. It wasn’t that I was afraid of spiders but they were just something I rather not come into contact with. “S HIT!” I yelped as a particularly large one came crawling out. Running down the box, he went under another one. “Are you okay?” I heard Alec yell up. “Yeah. I’m good.” I yelled back as I started looking through the box. It was filled from each side with nothing but paperwork. Not wanting to stay up here longer, I decided to just push the box to the opening and toss it down to Alec. Sitting the phone upside down so the flashlight was pointing upward, I started pushing the box with everything I had. Not wanting to hurt the baby and lift the box, this seemed easier. Plus, all the dust made. it easier to just slide it. “What are you doing?” Alec asked. “You ready to catch?” I asked as I came up on the hole. “Catch what?” I heard Alec ask that but it was too late. The box was already tipping and there was no stopping it. “HOLY F UCK KRISTEN!” I heard him shout just after a loud thud. The sound of papers flying around told me that I didn’t want to look.

“SORRY!” I didn’t have to hide my humor up here. “Sure you are.” He grumbled. Going to the next box, it was filled with some antique looking children’s toys as well as baby clothes. Not sure it was anything. worth anything but I could look at it more in the daylight. There might be anoveldrama

name or something on these items that would tell me more about who owned this house. “Ready for the next box? It isn’t heavy but delicate.” “Yeah.” Alec didn’t sound like he believed me but I didn’t heard any commotion down there. Not even bothering to look at what was inside of these boxes, I just scooted them over to the opening and dropped them down to Alec. He caught them all still. After snapping some pictures of the drawings on the walls, I looked down at Alec. He was looking rather annoyed with his hands on his hips. “I’m done.” “Good, let’s go.” Alec held up his hands. Slowly, I made my way down the ladder and into his arms. “Were you worried about me?” I teased when I was finally on the ground. “No. Just worried about what I was going to tell Colt when his sister fell through the floor.” Alec joked. My jaw hit the floor, making him laugh as he started carrying the boxes down the stairs. “Rude.” “Come on, you can tell Colt all you found out.” Alec yelled at me. “Do you need help with the boxes?” I asked as I caught up to him. “They are too heavy for you to lift right now. I’ll have a warrior help me.” I knew he was talking about our pregnancy but still it stung a little. ” Fine.” “And Kristen?” Alec turned so quickly that I almost bumped into him. “What?” “Turn your f ucking emotions back on.” He growled. It send a wave of pleasure between my legs. Making me squeeze my thighs together as I turned it back on. “Good girl.” He whispered and then turned to walk out the front door.

“What did you find?” Colt asked as he watched Alec place the box into the gator. “Lets take these boxes to your office and I will go through them and tell you everything.” I wanted to sit down for a little bit. “Feeling okay?” Colt asked. “Yeah, just tired.” “Alright. You girls can go sit down and once the boxes are put in here, we will head out.” Colt kissed Penny on the forehead before walking after Alec. Kara POV What the f uck kind of situation am I in? This is crazy! Not what I envisioned at all. To say I was stressed was an understatement. There hasn’t been any food to enter my mouth in weeks. I had dropped three sizes, my hair was looking rather ragged and my eyes. were sunken. Sitting on my bed, I was fresh out of tears. I just wanted to be loved. Was that so much to ask? Growing up, I always thought I would be entire world revolved around him. That is where my life turned upside down and kept on going. My mind flashed back to that morning. Every nerve ending in my body was flaring as I tried to keep calm. All the feelings were going through me. Mostly excitement as I thought I was finding my mate that day. My makeup was done so perfectly. I had put on a beautiful sundress and even curled my hair. Exactly what a luna should look like.















###Chapter 363

As soon as I saw him, we made eye contact and…. nothing. No bond. snapped into place. It was like everything collapsed around me and it was just Colt and I. except I wasn’t happy, the exact opposite. actually. I was completely heartbroken. The man I loved with every fiber of my being was looking at me with pity in his eyes. Not at broken heart like me but pity! All I got was ‘I’m sorry’ from him. He didn’t try to hug me or even touch me. It was all I could do but run back to my room. The worst part, I went to my bathroom to find a tissue. Since my eyes were so watery, I didn’t see my curling iron. I had turned it off but it was so hot from earlier that it hadn’t even had time to cool off. Burning my hand was just the tip of the bad day. After the birthday party, some friends took me out to a bar. Not Colt’s bar but another one in town. It was suppose to be more recreational fun. A few people I had met there told me they went there often. Since every time I looked at Colt and Penny, I wanted to die, it felt like a good decision. I had just put a smile on my face went I accidentally bumped into a guy on the dance floor. By this time, whatever the girls had given me was taking affect. When our eyes met, the bond snapped into place. He didn’t even hesitate to grab my waist and pull me against him. Hel kissed me hard. This is how I envisioned it with Colt. In my drugged mine, this was Colt.

Each touch left a wave of pleasure and electricity that was so consuming that I could barely breath. Next thing I know, we were in a back room and I was naked. My teeth were deep in his neck before he marked me back. Then, the world went black again. It wasn’t until I woke up the next morning that I was able to look at me was scared s hitless but the other part of me wasn’t. He was gentle with me. Never once did he hurt me or do anything I didn’t okay. Even that morning, he was sweet and gentle. He kissed my forehead and dropped me off about a mile from my pack. We decided that we couldn’t be seen together. Because of his pack, he didn’t want to bring me there

but he couldn’t exactly abandon hist pack and move in with me. Gunther told me he needed time to figure things out. However, he had this little cabin in the wood that we have been meeting up at. Every time I am there, he is wonderful. Little kisses to hot raw sex. Hel would confide in me how he wanted to get out and be with me. Hel wanted to provide me with a good life but then I would hear what horrible things he had done the day before. Now he wants me to sneak into Colt’s office? To top things off, Penny’s dad is now blackmailing me basically. He said he was going to help me but I wasn’t sure I fully trusted him. Still, if I could find a way to protect Gunther, I would do anything for al chance at happiness. Drying my eyes, I grabbed a pink wig and put it on. This was a short bob style and I did my make up really dramatic so it didn’t look like me. Most of the warriors were out again and I just watched Alpha Alec leave with Penny and Luna Kristen. This would give me a window. to do this. There was a letter I had wrote. I was still debating on giving it to them or not but I wanted so bad to just let Colt fix my problems but that wasn’t going to happen. Still, I didn’t want my pack to suffer. Especially when I know there is an imminent threat on it. Now, I wasn’t sure if it was just Penny they wanted or if they wanted to attack the whole pack. I wasn’t even sure who ‘they’ were. Putting the letter in my pocket, I creeped out from my room and started talking to Colt’s office. Now, I will forever know it as Colt’s office. As much as possibly, my brain has accepted that Penny didn’t steal him from me. It wasn’t her fault but I still didn’t like her. No one was around as I got on my knees and started working on the door. I have never been good at this. Truthfully, my anxiety is so hight right now that I think I might just pass out or pee myself. “What are you doing?” I heard someone ask from behind me. Mrs. Smith Author Π Thank you all for reading!

###Chapter 364

 “W-what?” I jumped so bad that my hand smacked into the door handle. Dropping everything in them, including the letter. Thankfully, the letter fell on top of everything. “I’m sorry, dear. Did I startle you?” Placing my hand over the letter, I looked behind me. Cassie was standing there, looking at me worriedly. “Yeah, a little.” I answered honestly. I was trying to see if Alpha Colt was in but I guess not. Grabbing the tools and the letter, I was able to shove them in my pocket as Cassie turned her back to have a seat on the floor. “Yes, they are out right now.” Cassie got comfortable and smiled at me. “I don’t remember seeing you here before.” “Oh, I’m trying out a new hair color. I. um… need to…”

“I’m a little sad. This packhouse has been wonderful but I am moving into my own house today and Penny isn’t here to help me. You know, I remember when I was your age. Full of life. Young and I had so many dreams to what my life was going to look like. My father, Alpha Ivan would spoil me rotten!” Cassie’s eyes glazed over like she had transported back in time. “I saw your mark and I remembered when I hoped to be marked by my mate.” S hit! Shifting my shirt, I moved so I was sitting more comfortably. Cassie didn’t look like she was going anywhere so as she kept talking, I slipped the note under the door and kept on listening. There wasn’t anyway I was getting into this office now. I’ll have to try again another. time. “Study hard, sweet girl. One day you will be luna and smart lunas get the best mates!” Cassie laughed. “That is what my dad used to tell me. Apparently, I didn’t study hard enough. Though, all those years in ummy on mo. IRHUM TUM LU Omoet tuin u yuuru. I’m not proud of it but it was my own little revenge. I may not be the best looker now but back then…. back then I was se xy. The more I flirted, the more they couldn’t resist me. Now, it only went so farnoveldrama

because Rip would feel the betrayal and come down to kill whoever it was but I didn’t care. They all needed to die.” “That would take so much strength.” I whispered in awe. “Not really. Honestly, when you only see dirt, it was the only way for me to entertain myself. It kept me feeling like a person and now a blow up doll. Sure, I got punished for it but just knowing I pis sed him off was worth it.” Cassie smiled at me. There wasn’t an ounce of regret on her face. “Can’t say I blame you.” I had to chuckle a little at that. “What would the guards tell you?” “What do you mean?” Cassie asked. “If you sweet talked them, would they just give in or why didn’t Rip just command them to not talk to you?” “Oh, well, he did. He did command them to not talk to me but they were men. Men that thought women were beneath them. If I couldn’t get them talk, I would just put on a show. I wasn’t allowed clothes. and after a year or so, you stop caring. They just couldn’t resist and disobeyed his command. I think that is what made him more mad. He would come down b itching that he had to drive all the way back in the woods or fly back on his plane.” “Where did he go?” I asked. “My father had a vacation home that was a state over. I’m not sure what is of it now but Rip would always say he had business to tend to there.” “Why didn’t Zac ever get you out of there?” I asked. I heard everyone give her a better life?














###Chapter 365

“One man against a whole army? I doubt he would have made it very far. Besides, he had to keep our Penelope safe. Rip never stopped looking for her. Even with Darin betraying him every chance he got. Should focus more on his own son and not my daughter.” Cassie obviously still held some resentment. “How did Darin betray him?” “Darin would force his friends to do things for him. More than once. hear they would argue about it in the cell. They thought no one wou filled or at least no one that could repeat it. Darin’s head was really filled with dust.” “Things like what?” “Not really sure. I think they had a side business going but I never heard enough details. Rip would come in b itching about having to handle his son and with I would just behave to make his life easier.”

“You seem to really love Zac, though.” I said, simply. “I do. I would do anything for him. He kept our daughter safe all these years at his own personal sacrifice. I think he lost so much of his humanity because of it. The Zac you see today is not the man he was twenty years ago.” “I could imagine so.” “She is now the Alpha and is carrying my grandchild. Though, I would still lay down my life for Zac. If I had to break into the worlds largest prison to save him, I would.” Cassie vowed. “Even if that meant you would die?” “Exactly. When you are in love, you will die for that person. Marking THE DONU TO VELJ physical but your head doesn’t ignore the evil that men can possess. After while, you are faced with a choice. You can either decide love is blind, adapt to their way of thinking and turn your emotions off or

you fight against the bond. No love is easy but knowing you have someone beside you that is wiling to die for you, you hold onto that.” That struck deep in me. Did I believe Gunther was a good man? Is he worth saving? Thinking back to all the times we have shared, hel treated me decent. He was rough around the edges but growing up in a life like that, I can’t be surprised. He said he wanted out and hasn’t shown me otherwise. “What is going inside your head, child?” Looking up, Cassie was looking at me with knowing eyes. “I’m just trying to find my path in this world…. for my happily ever after.” I said briefly. Last thing I needed was to say too much and tell her something I shouldn’t. “Just follow your heart.” Cassie smile warmly at me as she went to stand up. “Here! Let me help.” I said as I instantly jumped up. Grabbing her hand, I helped her stand. “Thank you. I’ve healed but there is still a lingering pain every now and then.” “Of course. I need to get going but thank you for talking to me.” I was starting to have this feeling that I needed to not be here anymore. “Come find me anytime. I enjoyed having someone to talk to!” Cassie waved bye to me as she turned and walked away. Without waiting, I took off in the opposite direction. Penny POV 213 I was never so happy to be back at the packhouse. The whole Victorian house was just creepy. Even though I didn’t go inside, the whole thing just had a bad vibe to it. Almost like a heaviness that kept. me from breathing freely. “Oh, Penelope!” Cassie’s greeting brought me out of my thoughts. We were walking into the packhouse as she was walking out. “Hello, how is your day?” I asked, trying to be polite. “Actually, very well, thank you. Are you busy today or can you meet. me for a late lunch?” Cassienoveldrama

looked at me hopeful. “Sure. I can do that. I have a meeting to go to right now but then I will meet you in the garden?” I offered.












###Chapter 366

“That would be lovely. I will organize it all.” Cassie had this massive smile on her face that made me feel a certain type of way. As she ran back inside, Colt put his hand on my lower back. “That was nice of you to agree to meet with her.” We continued to walk inside. “Truthfully, I haven’t even tried to get to know her yet.”‘ “Why not?” Kris asked as we came up to our office. “I could say it is because I am too busy but honestly, I have been avoiding her. Avoiding the whole situation.” Colt opened the door for us and closed it as we walked in. Taking a seat on the couch, Kris sat beside me and Colt sat at his desk. “Why are you avoiding her? Haven’t you always wondered what your parents were like?” Kris pushed. noveldrama

“I mean, I have but I assumed they were dead. My mother lived her life. in a cell and my dad lived on the streets. Doing things I probably don’t I want to know about. What would we talk about?” “Tell her about your project and why they are important to you. Talk to her about our mom and how your live in her house or the drawings. you have hung up.” “I don’t know… I guess that is a good suggestion.” “Listen, all I am saying is that I didn’t have a mother. Our’s died and I would give anything to have her back. You have a chance to get to know her. She might not be what you pictured but I think you would be surprised with how much you have in common with her.” Kris put her hand on my knee. “I’ll try.” I said after a moment. “Alec is going to burn that house down after he documents it all. We can get started without him.” Colt said, interrupting Kris. I wasn’t sure if he did that on purpose but I was thankful, regardless. “Okay. So overall, I got the vibe that they would lure girls in from the front door and up to the office

space. I would put money that they drugged the girls and either attacked them there or just moved them to the basement. As for the basement, I am thinking they put the girls into the holding cell before transferring them to the rooms. Now, the digs on the mattress. I sat on one and Alec helped me. From the position of them, the girl would be sitting up. Leaning against the wall. It felt like it was more of a viewing on how to shoot someone up. Like he was teaching people how to do drugs and control the women.” Kris looked at Colt. “Really?” Colt leaned back and looked at Kristen. It was then I felt like I was more of a bystander than actually part of this conversation. “The dips on the mattress only get there by prolonged exposure. Someone had to be sitting on the edge of it for hours to days. The girls were sitting up. Now, they could have very well been assaulted but it felt more like someone learning to do injections.” “Intersting.” Colt touched the tips of his fingers together as he looked at his twin. “I think they had a business of getting girls and then selling them to people who sell them to buyers. They do the risky part. Find girls and trap them. Then they allow others to sell them for a cut and in return teach them how to manage their girls. They have a business partner out there who is in charge of finding buyers and they inquire the girls. Might be on looks or by availability. Maybe both but that is what I think.” “What about how this might affect Penny?” Colt asked. “Well, now that is where this gets a little tricky. I’m just throwing how an idea here….” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! I like it Π









###Chapter 367

“What if….” Kris gave him a look before looking at me. “This is just a theory.” She told me before turning back to Colt. “What if Vin is trying to take over for Cash and continuing the business. Now, he would have lost his reputation and assuming his buyers do not want anything to do with him, he needs to prove he can run the business. What a better way to prove to them that he has what it takes by getting and selling the alpha of the pack? The daughter who inherited it all. The girl who stole it from Darin.” My mouth hung open and my eyes closed as she kept talking. This was too much. My hand moved to cover my belly as Kris fell silent. Opening my eyes and looking at Colt, he was just staring at his sister. An unspoken language between them that had never bothered me until this very moment.. Knock! Knock! The office door rattled but since Colt locked it, they couldn’t get him. Colt got up and opened it for Jacob. “I’m sorry, I’m running behind. Alec needed some help with the boxes. I have them. outside if you wish to bring them in here?” “Yes, please.” Kris answered for us. “Alright.” Jacob walked out and Colt got up to follow him. “Are you okay? It is just a theory.” Kris put her hand on my knee. “When has your theories ever been wrong?” I gave her a sad smile. It took everything in me to hold back the tears that wanted to show themselves. “There is a first time for everything.” Kris tried to pull me in for a hug but I gently leaned away.

“Thank you but I don’t really want to be touched right now. I am nonumy myoen up un UVIIL MUTIL “I understand that. All too well.” Kris whispered as the guys came back with the boxes. I watched as the three of them got down on the floor and started shifting through the boxes. I asked for this, didn’t I? I asked to be part of the discussions when it came to me. Kristen knew she was the target from day one. She was kidnapped twice and kept a straight face. I wanted to be like her but…. this was

too much. If Kris was right, which she is rarely wrong, I am their target because they are going to make a show of me. I guess finding that house was going to be a point for us. If Sherry would have been more forthcoming to begin with, we could have known this earlier. “Love, are you okay?” Colt asked in the mind-link. My whole body jumped. I didn’t realize I dazed off but as I looked over at them, Colt was still looking at papers. It was like he was trying to not bring attention to me, giving me time to gather myself. “No… yes… I don’t know.” “We don’t have proof what Ice said was even true.” “When is she ever wrong?” I asked. “I’ll keep you safe.” Colt promised. “Like Alec was able to keep Kristen safe?” I knew as soon as the words were out that it was the wrong thing to say. Colt jumped up, his black eyes looked an me angerly. “Whoa, what is going on here?” Kris jumped up and stood between us. Jacob grabbed Colt’s arms and pulled him back. “That’s your mate, dude.” “What did you just say?” Colt asked angerly at me. BONUS “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said it.” I whispered, unable to stop the tears at this point. “What did you say?” Kris turned and looked at me. “Colt said he would keep me safe and….” “And what?” Kris pushed. “I said he was going to keep me safe like Alec kept you safe.” Kris looked taken aback for a second. She didn’t yell and didn’t even look angry. “Colt, why don’t we go for a walk.” Grabbing his arm, she pulled him out of the office and shut the door. noveldrama

###Chapter 368

 “With all due respect, that was a low blow, Luna.” Jacob looked at me. “I know. I didn’t mean it as soon as it was out of my mouth but tell me I’m wrong Jacob. Tell me that Alec didn’t do absolutely everything he should have and she still got kidnapped? Tell me that with all the protection and limitations he put on her, how she still got taken? I’m not Kristen, Jacob. I’m not a fighter. I don’t know how to throw a punch. 1-1 make phone calls and organize parties. I build centers to help the development of children m entally and academically. Kristen was able to fight back. What will I even be able to do? I don’t stand a chance fighting back. Kristen got kidnapped twice and wasn’t pregnant. I am. I’m pregnant and I can’t fight.” “Shhh, come here.” Jacob walked towards me with his arms open wide. I didn’t realize I was rambling with tears running down my face. All my fears and concerns were brought to the surface. “I’m sorry.” “Luna, not everyone is meant to know all this stuff. Why do you think we keep this secret? We all grew up knowing all the danger that was around us. You didn’t. There is nothing wrong with you not wanting to be apart of it.” noveldrama


“I need to be. Our kids will need to be taught and what if something happens to Colt? I will have to take over until they are old enough, which means knowing all this.” “You have only been Luna for a short time.” Jacob stepped back but kept his hands on my arms. He leaned down and looked at me as I cleaned away the tears. “No one and I mean no one is immune to the hardship. F uck, look at me and Sherry. You saw me lose my s hit over her. You saw the bruises Colt and Alec sported on their stomachs. UNUS uwiranger. 100 outwardly has an exterior like… well ice. She learned that but on the inside, she was not okay. Ice cries in the shower or when she thinks we can’t hear but she does. Do you know how many times I have sat outside her bedroom door, listening to her cry or just making sure that she didn’t do something st upid?

Some people do handle it better than others but no one is immune. I can guarantee that Ice was scared the entire time she was kidnapped.” “Colt seems to be taken everything in strides, like it’s nothing.” It felt good to get that off my chest. Tell someone about it. “Luna, you don’t see him at training. He has pushed our men harder than we ever have before. He has increased security and really got the new warriors straightened out. I think Colt is trying to keep you calm.” “What do you mean?” “I mean, you are pregnant and getting stressed out isn’t going to help anything. Plus, he knows this isn’t something you grew up around so it’s much more scary to you than it is for us. Plus, there hasn’t actually been a threat made on your life. Other than Zac sending girls and Tanya running her mouth, we don’t actually KNOW anything. So far, all this is just speculation. Why are you working yourself up over something that we don’t even know is a real threat?” “I’m trying to stay strong but it’s hard.” “Luna, I truly do get that. I am all for you breaking down and working through your emotions. However, you got to find a way to stay strong. Not only for your babies but to keep Colt sane. Your luna legacy doesn’t have to be about fighting or war. It can be about education and helping those. You can be known as the sweet luna, the kind luna that everyone came come to if needed. You also need to be strong. for those who are hurting. You need to be level headed and be able to Sabres need you to stay strong down youred to and not need do priy sharine but don’t forget to keep your head and Kugati “









###Chapter 369

“I know you are right, I’m just not sure how to go about it.” “I can’t tell you that. Only you can find it and you have to look deep within yourself.” Jacob let me go and took a few steps back. “I think I am going to go meet Cassie for brunch now.” I said after al moment. “Good. Enjoy some food and relax a little. It is going to be a nice day today.” Jacob walked me over to the door and opened it. Kris and Colt were no where to be found. “Thank you, Jacob.” I said before he closed the door. “Of course, Luna.” He said before he closed it and I started walking to the garden. Different people were walking around. Soome said hello and others were running like they were late for something. Hoping my face didn’t give away the fact that I just cried, I walked up to Cassie. She was sitting with her back turned towards me and drinking what smelled like lemonade. noveldrama


“Hello.” I said as I walked around her. “Penelope! I am so glad you came.” Cassie smiled warmly at me. “Please, call me Penny.” I said as I took my own lemonade and too a sip. “Of course.” Cassie smiled at me as fruits got brought out with different sandwich options. A cold noodle pasta and yogurt finished it off. “Can I get anyone anything else?” The server was someone that got brought over from the other pack and I hadn’t learned her name yet. BONUS “I’m good, thank you. This looks delicious.” I said as I smiled at her.

“I’m good as well, thank you.” Cassie said. The girl bowed and walked away. “Thank you for coming. We haven’t had the chance to actually sit down and talk.” “Things have really been crazy lately. Isn’t today your move in day?” I asked, suddenly remembering. “It is. I am planning on doing that after this. I was hoping we would have been able to talk more before I moved but I’m just thankful to be here.” “Of course. That was my intention but I will admit I have been struggling with it.” Grabbing some fruit, I put them on my plate and took a sandwich. Cassie followed me. “Can you tell me what’s bothering you?” Cassie asked. “I don’t honestly know. My entire life I assumed you and Zac were dead. Of course I always dreamed of meeting you and knowing who you were but I knew that was just a fantasy. Now that you are actually here, I am finding myself feeling more angry. M entally, I know I had a way better life than if you would have kept me. My head knows that. My heart can’t wrap accept that never once did Zac try to reach out to me or you. I want to be selfish and say you could have paid a guard or something to send me something but I know that isn’t realistic either.” “If I could go back in time, I would have just taken you and ran with Zac. Honestly, I thought about it over and over again. Everyday I laid in that cell, my mind went to what ifs and eventually I had to forgive myself or I would have drove myself crazy. Seeing you… healthy and alive… I don’t regret giving you up. Especially when I lived almost twenty years in a cell. If we ran and we got caught, you would have begging for you to forgive me but I am forgiven myself. I’m not trying to be a mother figure to you but I would like the chance to get to know you.” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! I like it









###Chapter 370

 “I’ll try. Honestly, I am so caught up with some other things that I’m not sure I have it in me to get emotionally invested in something.” Cassie nodded her head as she took a bite of strawberry. “What do you have going on?” “I want my legacy of Luna to be about helping the kids that just need someone to believe in them. I am academically very intelligent but as a kid, I got into trouble. It wasn’t until Kris noticed me and gave me chance did I prove myself. I just needed her to believe in me. So, I build different programs to help kids. Regardless of age or problem, I want everyone to have a safe place to grow. Plus, we are building all these houses and navigating adding all these members to our pack. Then I have my luna ceremony I haven’t really touched and the Halloween party. When Colt and I mated, things were just getting started with Kris and Darin so I’m still trying to learn how to be a luna.” I didn’t want to tell her anything about Vin. Like Jacob said, there hasn’t actually been a threat on my life. “I love that. You know, when I was growing up, my dad had started something similar. Midnight Moon was once a happy place. Kids ran around, had pack BBQs and even held fighting competitions to encourage friendships. Dad had noticed smaller kids getting bullied and wanted a place for them to be able to train without being around the more athletic kids. He used to say that some people just need the extra help. Even if they weren’t warriors, average people could still stay healthy.” “Oh, really?” I asked, intrigued. “He was very proud of it. Dad was a very proud man. Colt reminds me of him.” Cassie was looking up at the sky. “Probably more loving behind closed doors but very protective.”


“Colt is very protective.” I agreed simply before putting some yogurt. into my mouth. “Have you guys had any fights?” Cassie asked before looking at me. “Just petty stuff really.” “Well, whatever it is, just remember that he probably has your best interest in heart. Dad would alwaysnoveldrama

do things I hated but looking back, he did them out of love.” “Like what?” I asked, more curious to learn more about him. or late “Oh, little things like needing a body guard or eating all my green beans. When I got older, it was things like not going to parties. night events. ‘Nothing good ever happens after midnight.’ That is what dad would tell me. I used to get so mad at him and sneak out the window!” Cassie laughed. I couldn’t help but smile at her. “Did you get caught?” “Every single time. It didn’t stop me though. However, it did get me a bad reputation. People assumed I was doing illegal thigs or whatever. They said I was making the alpha look bad. If he can’t contain his daughter, how can he control a pack?” “Did you get punished?” I pushed. “Not in the physical sense. He would yell and say he is disappointed in me or he would make me do some manual labor. However, I was popular and my friends would come help me. Dad never did figure out how I managed to finish so quickly.” “Was he strict?” “Very much so. He would let loose every now and then but it was rare to get a smile out of him. People would tell me that he was friendlier before he was alpha. Still, he read books to me and would watch. move up. “He sounds like he loved you.” I concluded. “He did. Still, he would often forget I had feelings and couldn’t just turn them off like he could.” “What do you mean?” I asked. Cassie got a sad look on her face. “Dad wanted me to learn to fight and do some drills with the warriors. He would get mad if I cried or showed any weakness. He felt like I should have been able to take it in stride.”








###Chapter 371

“He wanted you to be strong and hold your own.” “That is one way to look at it. The other would be he was mean and abused me.” “Do you really think that was his true intention?” I asked. “Do you really think whatever you are fighting with Colt about his true intention?” That stopped me in my tracks. The fork was half way to my mouth and now it just hung in the air. “It’s clear you been crying. There are two ways of looking at things. Are you only considering. your view or are you trying to see things from his perspective?” The way she flipped that around was impressive. However, shel wasn’t wrong. Alec literally did everything he thought was needed. It might not have been enough but in his mind he did what he needed to. Would I have done anything differently? She was limited on her outings. Bodyguards and even closed her business. Colt was doing everything he needed to. Although what I said wasn’t wrong, it was how I felt. Colt probably took that as I didn’t have any faith in him ability to protect me. Which, wasn’t true at all but Kris had faith she was safe too. “So, do you feel like you are having a boy or girl?” Cassie pulled me out of my thoughts with a whole new topic. “Actually, I am starting to have a feeling there are two in there.” That was the first time I said it out loud. noveldrama

“Twins! That would be amazing. Why do you feel like that?” Cassie was smiling. Setting down her fork, she pushed her plate away and leaned back. “Just a feeling I have. My stomach is much better than Kristen’s and she is a little ahead of me.” “Everyone grows at different rates. I showed very early with you.” Cassie nodded as she spoke. “I haven’t decided if I am enjoying this or not. It’s weird. My body isn’t really my body right now. Everything feels different. Things taste different, clothes fit different and I smell things differently. I don’t

even recognize this person right now.” “Pregnancy is both hard and beautiful. Some women actually hate being pregnant.” “Really?” “Oh yeah. Especially the ones that having bad morning sickness but some start swelling at eight weeks. It isn’t always sunshine and rainbows.” “Did you enjoy being pregnant?” I asked. “Well, that wasn’t exactly a high point in my life. I was happy I was pregnant but scared for your safety. I think I would have enjoyed being pregnant more if I was able to wear the cute pregnancy clothes and show my belly off at social events. Rip kept me in the bedroom and denied me access to the outside world. If I was able to get out, I was usually cleaning or something. “Oh.” I wasn’t sure what to say. “When you were born, my heart broke with how much I loved you. So perfect and tiny. Giving you to Zac was the hardest thing I have ever done and I’ve done some…..questionable things.” “You seemed to be adapting well to this pack house? I could imagine coming from the cells to here would be hard.” I asked a more lateral question to avoid the intimate conversation she hinted to. 20 “I have loved living here. I actually had a great conversation with a young woman who was knocking on your office door.” “Oh? When was that?” I asked, shocked. “Actually, just right before you came home. I walked up and she was trying to see if you were inside. Cute little girl, pink hair is a bit much and the makeup was heavy.” “Pink hair?” “Yeah, she had pink hair and a thick layer of makeup. I wonder if her mate likes the pink hair?” Cassie said the last part more to herself. “I’m not sure I know of any girl with pink hair in my pack.” I said, confused. “She might have dyed it today. I might be old but that hair was defiantly pink.” Cassie said as she

shifted in her seat. “I’m afraid I need to get moving on moving.” GET IT NOW







###Chapter 372

 “Oh!” Looking at the time, it was getting late. “We talked longer than I thought we would.” “I was having too much of a good time to cut it shorter but as it is getting late, I need to moved the essentials to the house so I can stay there tonight.” “Well, I hope you find the house comfortable.” I said as we stood up. “Child, everything is comfortable compared to a cell.” Cassie laughed. and pulled me into a hug. I didn’t resist but hugged her back. Still didn’t feel like I was hugging my mother but it was still comforting. “We will have to do this again.” I said and I meant it. “I agree.” Cassie put her hand on my cheek for a moment and turned to leave. “Having a great afternoon!” She yelled. “Bye!” I said as I turned and walked to the front door. I was surprised to see Alec, Kris, Jacob and Colt sitting on the front steps. “I assume you guys finished with the boxes?” I asked. Stopping at the bottom step, I just leaned against the post. Kristen was across from Alec, Jacob was sitting on the top step leaning forward and Colt was hunched over the railing. “We did. There was some stuff but nothing shocking.” Kris said. “How was lunch with Cassie?”

“Went better than I expected it to.” “Well, I think it’s time for us to head home.” Kris looked at Alec. He got up and took her hands to help her stand. “You are welcome to stay for supper. I have a recipe from your UYGI BIJU TUIUA with us.” “Hmm, what are you cooking?” Kris looked conflicted. “Sp icy Tuna Rolls.” noveldrama

“I thought you can’t have Tuna or sushi?” Jacob asked. “Actually, you can have Tuna in moderation. So much in one week is okay and you can have cooked sushi. Since the meat in sushi is Tuna, we are okay. Any cooked meat in the sushi is okay.” I clarified. “Fair enough.” Jacob nodded. “However, I am going to pass. Sherry and I have some stuff to work out.” Jacob got up and started walking inside. “Good luck.” I said and smiled at him. “Thanks, I’ll need it.” He yelled without turning around. “So, did I tempt you to come over?” I asked. “You did.” Kris sighed. “Good. I need a few things from the store. Would you mind getting them for me?” “Of course. What do you need?” “Seaweed and sesame seeds.” “Key ingredients there.” Kris smiled at me as they walked down the rest of the stairs. “Yes, they are.” Kris and Alec walked passed me and got into their cars. That left Colt and me. I could feel his eyes on me the entire time. “So, you had a good brunch?” Colt asked breaking the silence. He stood up straight and came down the stairs. “I wouldn’t mind doing it again.” I said. Not moving towards him, he walked up to stand in front of me but staying an arms length away. “I suppose we should have a talk.” “Let’s talk on the way home.” Colt said. Putting his hand on my lower back, he guided me to his car. After he opened my door, I got in and he closed it. Going around to the drivers side, he got in. I waited for him to start the engine and pull out before talking. “I understand Alec did everything in his power to protect Kristen. I do not blame him or you for her

being kidnapped. What scares me is that even with everything that was done to protect Kristen, she still got taken. I’m not a fighter like her. She stood a chance and had what it took to beat Rip. I don’t. I don’t have her fighting personality.” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! 01









###Chapter 373

 “So, you’re upset because you don’t believe you are strong enough to survive being kidnapped?” Colt asked. “Yeah. I know you can protect me. That’s not it. You would know if I was lying.” “I just wish you would have told me this in private.” Colt sighed. “Is there anything in particular that would want done? Like-security or working conditions?” “What do you mean?” I wasn’t fully understanding what he was asking. “What would make you feel safer? I’ll build you a safe room that is solid inch thick stainless steel box if you want.” “Like you said, there hasn’t actually been a threat on my life. I think I am just more worried because I am pregnant and I’m worried. something might happen to them.” “Them?” Colt looked at me as he pulled into our house. “I just have a feeling there are two in there.” Colt shut the engine off and reached over. His hand covered my stomach. “I got two babies in there….” noveldrama

“Well, we will need to get an ultrasound to check that out.” Resting my head on his shoulder, he kissed my forehead. “Well, get that schedule. I want to see how many babies I have.” Colt pulled his arm back and got out of the vehicle. “I’ve been avoiding that but I suppose I should get on that.” I said as I got out as well. “Why have you been avoiding it?” “Just don’t like the idea of it all. Being exposed or the checks. I just don’t like it.” Walking inside, I couldn’t help the smile that was on my face. This was my home. I had already moved the furniture like Kris suggested and bought new stuff. Kris hasn’t seen the changes I made so I’m excited to hear what

she thinks. The walls changed to a light shade of Sage green. The light grey couch and recliners with well with black and cream accents. Green plants sat in the corner as well as hanging from the ceiling. It was my happy place. “I’m not sure you can avoid getting checked but we can ask the doctor about limiting them.” Colt walked to the kitchen and pulled out a bottle of water. Following him, I started getting everything out to make the S picy Tunal Sushi. Since I am pan-frying the tuna, I pulled out my cast iron skillet. That would be a little better.” Colt was leaning against the wall and was watching me work. “How as your brunch?” “It was okay. I’m starting to think there is some permanent brain. damage.” “Why do you say that?” Colt asked as I put the rice in the pot. “She was telling me she was talking to some girl with pink hair and a face full of makeup. Apparently, she walked up to her as she was trying to see if we were in our office. “Interesting.” Colt said. He sat down on a stool. “I’m not sure I know any pack members with pink hair.” “Unless it was someone in a wig… which I guess it is possible.” “Hmm.” Colt nodded as the door bell rang. “Come in!” He yelled. “Oh, wow! This place looks great!” Kris was smiling as she stood in the living room and looked around. “I’m glad you like it!” “I am going to go show Alec your garden.” Colt said as he stood up. He grabbed two beers from the fridge. “Do you want to see the garden?” I asked Alec. “I’ve heard you are pretty good at it. Been thinking about starting my. own.” “Seriously?” Kris look at Alec like he was s tupid. “See, still come mystery in our lives.” Alec smirked as he walked out. Kris rolled her eyes as they left. “They just wanted to speak together privately.” “What would they have to say in private that they can’t say in front of us?” I asked as I started the tuna. “Probably something to do with the luna ceremonies.” Kris shrugged. She didn’t seem too concerned

about it. Colt POV “That wasn’t exactly subtle, dude.” Alec took the beer from my hands as we actually looked at the garden. Where Penny found the time to tend to this, I have no idea. GET IT NOW 17









###Chapter 374

 “It was a spare of the moment idea.” Taking a long sip, I pulled the paper out of my pocket and handed it to him. “What’s this?” “I found it up against the wall in my office. Like someone put it under the door and when the door got opened, it was pushed against the wall. I have no idea how long that has been there but Penny told me that Cassie was talking to a girl with pink hair and a face full of makeup. After reading that, it sounds like someone was in a disguise.” “There is a threat against Penny. Protect her at all cost. They are coming.” Alec read. “This is pretty vague and poor handwriting.” “I have a theory.” “What’s that?” “I haven’t told you yet that I got a call when you were in the house with Ice. Zac lied to me. The man we found dead was killed by Zac. Zac wrote the message in that man’s chest. The dead guy was part of Vin’s pack. He told me Gunther burned down Zac’s safe house. Apparently, he followed Zac for awhile. So far that he watched as Zac made his way back to my pack, saw a girl jump the fence and follow the girl to Gunther’s house.” “No s hit?” “Yeah, I guess Gunther has a mate from my pack. Zac didn’t tell me any of this.” noveldrama

“Do you think Zac is playing both sides?” Alec asked as he swallowed. half his beer. 1/2 “Not sure. I know he lied to me but I don’t see him handing Penny over. I think Zac has his own agenda and it includes sacrificing me to save Penny.” “Who’s the girl?” “He didn’t know and wasn’t able to get a picture. However, if Gunther is using his mate to get

information from my pack, they would probably use a disguise to do it.” “Surely she wasn’t the one that left the note.” Alec handed it back to me. “Unless she doesn’t want to turn her back on me but feels obligated to please her mate, or he is abusing her.” “If that was the case, why not just come to you and tell you all this?” Alec asked. “I actually had a different idea.” “What’s that?” “Plant information for her to take to Gunther. Let him think he is getting information and use it to our advantage to draw them out.” “Did your guy not know where Gunther and Vin live that we can just go kill them?” Alec asked. “He said they have houses but don’t stay there often. Though, he has only bee around them for a little bit.” I wish it was as simple as that. “If we play the long game, we can. possibly take out their buyers too.” “That is risky. Especially since that note mentions Penny.”. “I know.” “That would be a fun plan though. Allow something to break into your 20 sensitive information first.” “I would need to install discreet cameras to see if we can figure out who the girl is.” Not sure if I was as excited as Alec made it sound like. “Are you going to tell Penny about this?” “I’ll have to. I told her I would tell her everything when it came to her and she needs to vacate that office now. “You need to start with limiting her availability now. We can’t ignore this direct threat, even if it came from a note. On top of what Tanya said…. Vin and Gunther very well might have a bigger plan in play

then we are aware of.” “Hopefully, my guy can figure it out. We can’t rely on Zac.” “What are you going to do about Zac?” “Right now, nothing. I am going to wait and see how much rope it takes to hang himself with. Since he carved that into that man’s chest, he believe I was the only alpha. That if Vin challenged me, I would either kill Vin and issue would be over or Vin would kill me. Not sure what his plan would be if that happened. Take Penny and run?”








###Chapter 375

 “What about the kid?” “Well, I would hope you would track them down and raise them the right way. If you could save Penny too, that would ideal.” “Obviously. Let’s take it one step at a time. Vacate your office. Leave false information and let’s see how far this goes.” “That’s the other problem. What do I leave for them to find?” “Well, if you go off what we found in the boxes and in the house, they probably want blueprints.” “I could make some up.” “Do you have the original blueprints? The ones that the architect showed you before you made all the changes to Penny’s new buildings?” “I’m sure I do… somewhere.” “Find them. Use those. Install a s hit ton more cameras around an have someone watching them at all times.” “Alright. I’ll get one that first thing tomorrow. I’ll let you know when we are ready to move forward with this plan.” noveldrama

“Sounds good. You need to make sure nothing appears out of the normal. Don’t want to sp ook the girl.” Alec took our empty bottles and tossed them into the recycling. “Boys! Supper is ready!” Kris called out through the window. “Let’s keep this to ourselves for tonight. I want Penny to have one more happy evening before her world is turned upside down.” “Nobsaurel kknow he lied to me but I don’t see him handing Penny owerl think Zod has his own agenda and it includes sacrificing me to savve Penny.” “Who’s shbegin?”

“He didin’t know and wasn’t able to get a picture.

###Chapter 376

 “Just one!” Kris smirked at me as she handed over the pictures. “What am I looking at?” I asked. “This is the baby.” Penny pulled the pictures to her and pointed out a little bean shape blob. “I’ll take your word for it.” I said as I handed them back over. “You don’t think your little niece or nephew is cute?” Kris took the pictures and looked at them lovingly “It looks just like you.” I teased. “Since we are literal twins, I don’t think that comment has the same affect.” Kris rolled her eyes at me. “Have you got a sonogram yet?” She asked Penny. “Not yet. I’ve been putting it off. I know I need to though.” Penny poked around at her sushi.

“I loved it. Getting to see our baby, it was a very special moment for us.” Wanting to get the attention off Penny, “Wow, sis. Now who is turning into a mushy person. If I didn’t know any better, I would think you are quite soft.” “Kiss my as s.” Ice’s head whipped around to glare at me quickly. All I could do was toss my head back and laugh. “Thank you for supper but I think we need to head home.” Alec was smirking but rolling his eyes at us. “There is only so much someone can take of your guys bickering.” “We do not bicker.” I said, faking hurt. “You do and for adults… it’s just sad.” Penny gave me a look and took our plates to the sink. “I have no idea what you are talking about.” Ice got on my side as we were ganged up on by our mates. “You’re full of s hit.” Alec crossed his arms over his chest and gave her a look. “And you can sleep on the couch!” Ice glared back.

“Give him hell.” I whispered but everyone heard me. Giving her a hug, I pushed her towards him. “She is your problem but I love you sis!” Ice looked at me like I betrayed her. “Jacka ss.” She muttered as they were leaving. “Thanks for coming!” Penny yelled. Alec raised his had to wave goodbye before they closed the front door. “That went well.” Smiling at her, I helped Penny do the dishes. “That was our first time hosting in this house.” “I know. The bar and seating really worked out great.” Penny agreed. I was washing the dishes as she finished straightening up. “Do you want to watch a movie tonight?” “Actually, I have something important I need to discuss with you.” “Are you going to tell me what you and Alec felt the need to talk in private about?” “It wasn’t exactly the need for privacy but to bounce ideas off. We work best when it is just us talking and don’t need to concider outside. opinions.” “Like your mates?” Penny pushed. “Actually, yes. Alec and I like to figure things out. We will call each other out on our s hit and it helps when you and Ice aren’t around. We can be more forthcoming and not worry about how the other person. will take it. However, that is the reason I am telling you tonight. I want. to run by you what we discussed and see how you feel about it. Your opinion matters but I needed to figure out how I felt about things sol when I talk to you, I know what a good corse of action would be.” “Sounds like a copout to me.” Penny said as she rested her hip against the counter. Drying my hands off on a towel, I was able to flip it over my shoulder before picking Penny up and sitting her on the counter. “It’s just how I operate.” Grabbing a fist full of hair, her head tilted backwards. Allowing my tongue to graze her neck. “Oh…I want…” Penny tried to form a sentence as I slowly kissed down her neck. Reaching down, it was too easy to slip a hand under her dress and between her parted legs.


















###Chapter 377

“I love how your body responds to me.” I whispered in her ear as my finger slipped under her panties. “Mmmm.” Penny groaned. Slipped a finger in, it was all I could do to hold myself back. She was so f ucking s exy that I could barely handle it. Moving her dress up, Penny even helped me pull it out from under her. Shrinking down to a knee, the counter was the perfect height for me to eat her sweet juices. Penny put her feet on either of my shoulders and leaned back, allowing me to fully have access. Pull her as s to the end of the counter, my eyes watched as she enjoyed every lick… every touch and every feeling I gave her. With my fingers inside her and my tongue on h er cli t , I had her or gasming three times before I finally allowed her to relax. Her legs were shaking so bad that I had to pick her up and carry her upstairs to our bed. ” F uck… me…Colt.” Penny said between breaths. “Plan on it.” Sitting her on the bed, I made her take off her dress. before allowing her to lay back. The dresses were expensive but she seemed to like them and I wanted her to wear something more. comfortable. What I wasn’t prepared for was for Penny to stop me. Flipping me. over, she undid my pants. Freeing my d ick , she lowered her mouth tightly around it. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes back and put my hand on her head. I knew she felt awkward and unsure as she sucked me but it felt. amazing. “F uck, Penny.” I groaned as she picked up her pace. Her nails raked down my stomach as she kept going. As soon as they hit mipo, I Dow my c um , u

As soon as I was done, I just laid there. Breathing heavily as Penny sat up and cleaned her mouth off. “So, what did you want to talk about?” My eyes looked at her body. She still had on a black bra, her stomach swelled around her panties that

were soaking wet. Leaning up, I grabbed her arm and pulled her down on top of me. “There was letter I found against the wall in our office” Flipping her own and ripped her panties off, I went to play with her some more. “What did… it say? Penny asked as her breathing. increased. “It threatened you. Saying attack was imminent.” I said as my finger grazed her still swollen c lit. “SO+ there is a threat against me now?” Penny threaded her hands. through my hair. Keeping my fingers in her, my mouth moved to her breast. “There is.” I mumbled with a mouth full. “Now what?” She asked in a moan. “Well, adjacent to that letter, there is the pink hair girl.” Moving my tongue to her neck, I started sucking on my mark. That really caused her to start twitching. “How does she fit in?” Penny moaned loudly. Her claws dug into my hips. “Thinking she is trying to break into our office. I have a guy following Zac. He has lied to us about everything.” Looking up at her, Penny met my eyes. “What?” 70 “Exactly. He lied to us. He was the one that killed that man that was found at the house. He buried him there. Zac also found a girl jumping our fence and running into the arms of Gunther.” Moving my hands faster, Penny’s fist grabbed the sheets as she fought to stay me ntally focused. Her legs were spread far, giving me whatever I wanted. “Who…who was it?” “No idea.” Another org asm hit. Allowing her to ride it out, I just gently kissed her. Only when she came down again, did I start talking again. “ We were thinking of setting a trap.” “Trap?” Penny said trying to focus. Her eyes were battling to stay noveldrama

open. “Remove all important documentation from our office and allow this girl to break in. Plan false information, blueprints or whatever. Set up cameras and see what she takes and brings to Gunther. If we can take down the whole operation, shouldn’t we try?” GET IT NOW













###Chapter 378
“Operation as in what they were doing at the house?” Penny asked. “Exactly.” My hand wrapped around her neck, rubbing my thumb against her cheek. “We need to keep you guys safe.” “I trust you.” Penny said as she looked into my eyes. “Allow me to make whatever changes I need to make in order to keep you safe.” “I give you permission to do whatever you need to do to figure this out. However, I want you by my side more. Not a guard but you. Penny said with conviction. “That would mean you need to be around training, fighting and I everything else I need to handle.” I warned. So far, I have kept her away from it. “I understand. I’ll bring my laptop and work on things remotely.” There was so much love in her eyes that I didn’t think it was possible to have any deeper feelings than I already did. Resting my hand on her swollen stomach, I felt a little flutter “Hmm.” Penny smiled.

“Was that….?” “It was. It was our baby.” Penny rested her head against my arm as she joined me in feeling her belly. “It moved.” Resting my head against her belly, her hands moved to my head. “The baby loves hearing your voice.” Penny whispered. “Dada loves you.” I said to her belly. It felt another little flutter under my nunu. “I think he loves his daddy too.” Penny laughed. “Is this the first time you felt it?” I asked, looking up at her.

“It is.” Penny scrunched up her face. “Kinda awkward too. Like a little alien living inside you.” “You did not just call our child an alien!” I teased as I pulled her on top of me. “AH!” Penny yelled but laughed as she setting down on me. “Anything else you need to tell me?” She looked at me and wiggled her hips over my dic k. “That was the jist of it.” I said, trying to not c um too fast. “Are you getting tired?” Penny asked as she c ocked her head to the side. Folding my hands behind my head, I just watched her in all her confidence she was showing. “Maybe but I could be persuaded stay up a little.” Her eyes narrowed at me. “Is that so?” She moved back off my hardened di ck. “Doesn’t look like you are satisfied yet.” “That’s your job, not mine. I did my job.” I gave her a challenging look “Are you sure you did?” Penny asked as she grabbed my d ick and started stroking it. It was physically painful to not reach when she touched me. “Are you telling me that you still aren’t satisfied yet?” Not even flinching, I just watched her play with me. “Pretty much. I mean, I barely even org asmed.” Penny widened her eyes and looked away. 207 Slowly, I sat up and grabbed her hips. “Mission accepted.” I said as 1 picked her up and shoved her down on my di ck in one motion. Her mouth dropped open as a little gasp escaped but that was it. Flipping her over, I moved so I was off the bed. Penny was laying over the side as I started jack hammering into her. With a fist full of hair, I pulled back, forcing her to arch her back. It only took seconds before I cam but I kept going. Her eyes started shaking, her hands were gripping the sheets for dear life but it still wasn’t enough. Flipping her over, I kept going until my teeth sank into her neck, forcing us both to org asm.

Penny laid there motionless for awhile until she rolled her head over to me. “That is how you give me bad news.” “I’ll keep that in mind.” I said, laughing.

###Chapter 0379

Penny POV

"Are you about ready?" Colt knocked on the bathroom door. Currently, I was standing in a pretty elegant dress that really showed off just how big my bump had gotten in the last few days. It was a sapphire blue dress. The top was a thicker strap that hung just over my shoulders and went into a deep V. The back was corset style and after a tight chest, it flowed to the ground. Every time I moved, sparkles shimmered in the light.

"Yes." I said back, not really paying attention. My hair was curled and partly pinned up. My cheeks were rosy and all my jewelry matched perfectly.noveldrama

"We are going to be late if we don't hurry." Colt said. "Can I come in?"

Sighing, I reached for the door and turned the knob. "I'm ready." Giving me a small smile, I went to put my shoes on.

"That dress looks amazing on you." Colt knelt down and took my shoe from my hands.

"Thank you."

"When is our sonogram?" Colt asked as he finished helping me put my shoes on.

"The doctor was going to go into the office tomorrow. That way we have some privacy."

"You're nervous." Colt didn't ask but told me.

"I honestly am not sure why. Maybe it is become I am convinced there are twins in there." My hand landed on my belly.

"I would love twins." Colt leaned over, kissed my belly and stood up. Grabbing my arms, he helped me stand before we headed out.

"Why so?"

"Ice and I have this connection that I won't ever lose. We understand each other. Having a sibling is a built in friendship, having a twin makes it even more special." Colt opened the car door for me.

"Having two babies at the same time sounds exhausting." I said after Colt walked around and got in.

"That's why you have me." Colt smiled at me as we pulled out of our driveway. "We need to talk about today." Colt gave me a look

"Yeah. I know we need to do things a little different but this is Kris's luna ceremony. I don't want to take anything away from her."

"Your safety is more important than any ceremony." Colt reached over and held my hand. "The warriors are going to be standing around. Alec has arranged for security to do ID checks and even people to get wanded."

"That seems extreme. Do you honestly thing that is not too much? With all the alpha's around, surely they wouldn't try anything." That shocked me. "Though, I'm sure the alphas appreciate it."

"I doubt anyone will complain but we aren't exactly telling them why we are doing this either." Colt sighed. "What am I suppose to tell people when they ask?"

"Just that we are focused on safety of our packs." Colt said in a very political voice.

"What other things do you want to go over?" I asked. We were about at the event center and I didn't want to make a show of anything.

"Just basic things. Sherry obviously isn't going to be there so Jacob will be your personal bodyguard. I will be around as much as possible but since I am walking Ice up to Alec, I need someone to be beside you. Then, just the basic things. Don't go away from the party without Jacob or myself. Don't go anywhere without our knowledge. If you need to get away, we have set up a room for you girls to go relax in."

"That is a relief. I'm not sure these shoes are going to stay on." They were only two inch heels but since my balance is off, it would be nice to take them off.

Colt parked the car and turned the engine off but held me back from opening my door. "Last demand. It's not a request either. Leave your mind link open to me at all times. Do not close it for any reason. If you do, I will raise hell till I find you."



















###Chapter 380

“I can do that.” I said. THe look on his face made me feel like it was more for his peace of mind than a security reason. “Thank you.” Colt leaned over and kissed me gently before getting out. Since my balance was off, I waited till he came around and helped me out of the car. Last thing I wanted was to fall in front of all these people that were walking in. Jacob was waiting at the front door for us with a very serious. expression on his face. “Alpha, Luna.” He said in a very serious tone. “Beta.” Colt straightened his suit jacket and looked around. I guess. this was going to be the tone for the day. “So far everything is going smoothly. The last of guest just made their way inside and we are scheduled to start in ten minutes.” “Alright. Go ahead and take your seats. I am going to go find Ice.” Colt leaned down and kissed my cheek and then walked away. “Do you need to use the restroom before we sit?” Jacob asked as he moved to stand on the outside and pushed me against the wall. noveldrama

“No, I am good still but I would like to hold your arm as we walk. I am getting a little unstable, especially in these heels.” Jacob nodded and offered me his arm. Part of me wanted to strike up a conversation but he kept his head on a swivel as we made our way. to our seats. The ceremony was beautiful. Circle tables filled part of the room, allowing room for an aisle. Kristen went with a starry night kind of theme. Black fitted tablecloths laid under a simple candle arrangement and the yellow lights were turned down. String of tiny yellow lights really made the ceiling look like stars in the sky. “Here we are.” Jacob put us at a table at the very front. Place cards. labeled everyone’s chairs. Jacob was on one side and Colt was on the other. I assumed the rest was for Jasper and Emmy. Alec and

Kris would most likely be seating by themself at a different table. A wooden alter was at the end of the aisle with dark blue and black flower petals made a circle where they are going to be standing. A little table next to the alter had the chalice and a ceremony knife with two clothes next to it. The more I looked, the more I realized just how many warriors stood. guard. Every five feet there was another man standing tall. With ear pieces hanging down, their black outfits were really something. Some were our men and some were Alec’s “Do you think there is going to be an attack?” I asked Jacob. “Can’t be too safe.” He said but he wasn’t really paying attention to me. “Hey!” Emmy’s voice came up behind me. Giving her a smile, I was relieved to have someone to talk to. “Hello! No baby?” I asked. “Nope, got a babysitter for tonight. We wanted a relaxing evening.” Emmy sat down in her seat and Jasper stayed standing. Jacob stood up and walked next to Jacob. They were talking so low and with all the other talking going on, I couldn’t hear what they said. “I’m glad you are going to get to relax for awhile!” “How have you been feeling?” Emmy asked me. “Like a whale.” I laughed. “My balance has really come into question lately.” “I feel like you have really popped.” Emmy looked at my belly. As obvious I was pregnant now, which liked but I just really felt off. “I do too. I know I’m not that big yet but I feel like I have grown so much that my center of gravity is off” “Are you at our table?” Colt asked in the mind-link “I am Just talking to Emmy “I replied back to Colt. He didn’t answer but I could really feel him in the back of my mind. He was listening to my conversations right now.














###Chapter 381

 “It doesn’t get better. The more you grow, the more you really question your balance. Plus, after you have the kid, you realize just how much your body has really changed. Nothing will be the same.” Emmy took a sip of a water that she had and I suddenly wished I had some too. The lights dimmed a little more and the music changed. Everyone stood up as Colt and Kris turned the corner. Jacob offered me his hand as I tried to stand securely. I’m not even sure when Alec and another Alpha came up to the alter but as Colt and Kris walked down, her eyes never left him. She was wearing a very fitted white dress with beading down. The long sleeves. hung over her shoulders and the bottle flared into a mermaid and a train. Her hair was in a low bun. Emmy must have done her hair and makeup because she was incapable of doing it herself.

“She looks so beautiful.” I whispered as they passed. “Indeed.” Jacob said as he stood close to me. It was almost a little too close for my liking but since I knew him, I didn’t feel uncomfortable. Colt handed Kris off to Alec and walked over to me. Jacob took a step back and Colt wrapped his arm around me, holding me against him. They nodded at each other in understanding for Colt now being responsible for me. Jacob visibly relaxed a little but kept his back straight. “Ladies and Gentlemen. Finally, we are able to come together and celebrate the union of Alpha Alec and Luna Kristen. It is my great pleasure to be able to stand in for Alpha Marc and preform this for them. Alpha Marc was not only a great allie but a great friend. Having the picuburing me mun yum up I assume Luna Kristen you are aware that he leaves his socks around and doesn’t always put the toilet seat down.” The crowd giggled in response. “The union between you both started months ago. Although, Luna Kristen was already sworn into the pack, we need to follow our traditions. You both have already shown each other what it means to stand

beside each other in thick and thin. More than once, both of you have been in danger. Still, you stand in front of me as a unit of one. We will start with the vows they have personally wrote and then we will move to the unity ceremony. Alpha Alec….” “Who is doing the ceremony?” I asked Colt in the mind link. “Alpha Thomas. He has been our allie as well for years.” “Kristen, from the moment I walked into your tattoo shop, I knew you were destined to be mine. Your beauty took my breath away that I even forgot what I went in there for. That hasn’t changed. Every time I see you, my breath is caught in my throat and all I see is you. I have seen you bleed, cry, laugh, and even yell a time or two. You have brought more excitement to my life than I never need to relive but I wouldn’t change anything about our story. It has made us a stronger couple. Not only for us but for our people. You have taught me how to rule with my heart and not just my head. I am a better man for having you in my life. Now that we have a baby on the way, I have no doubt that you will teach me how to be a father as well. I couldn’t imagine going on this ride with anyone else, you are not only my mate but my true soulmate. I love you more than can ever express.” I couldn’t help the single tear that fell down my face.noveldrama









###Chapter 382

 “Luna Kristen, please say your vows. + “Alec, from the moment we met, you had this unwavering faith that we were mates. Even when I was doubting everything I knew, you stood firm. Over and over again you would reassure me that we were meant to be together. What scared me most was how you were able to zone in on all my insecurities. Instead of using them against me, you built me up with them. You taught me what it means to love unconditionally…. what safety feels like. You have helped me realize my full potential. Our relationship is not only built on a mutual respect but a friendship that is unwavering. We laugh, roll our eyes at eachother and even bicker frequently. I’ve laughed, cried and yelled at you. Even on our worst days, I wouldn’t trade us for anything. I promise to continue to annoy the s hit out of you but give you all the respect in the world. As great of a mate and alpha you are, I know you will be an even better father. Alec, I love you.” I could hear sniffling all around the room with a few giggles at Kris’s joke in her vows. Colt was feeling very proud of his sister. The whole thing made me very nervous for our ceremony. Not sure how we will compare to this. noveldrama

“Now, we will move to the unity ceremony.” Kris and Alec moved to stand in front of the chalice. “Alpha Alec, please take the knife. The knife that has been used for generations of alphas. By spilling your own blood, you unit your pack with their luna.” Alec took the knife and quickly sliced down. “As your blood drips into the chalice, you have committing to eternal commitment.” As soon as enough blood was give, Kris picked up the cloth and gently tightened it around his fist. “With my blood, I am committing to my enteral bond.” Alec said as he looked into Kris’s eyes. “Luna Kristen. Please take the knife and spill your blood in proof of your commitment to Alpha Alec and his pack.” Kris took the knife and without hesitation, sliced down her palm. Putting her hand over the chalice, the blood flowed until it started to slow down into a drip. “With my blood, I am committing to my enteral

bond.” Kris repeated as she looked at Alec. Taking the other strip of fabric, Alec tied it around her hand. Alpha Thomas held up the chalice in the air. “Together, they have sacrificed a part of themselves that is unbreakable. As they drink, they will become one. One ruler with one soul. Two equal parts that makes a single victor. Drink and confess your loyalty.” “I, Alpha Alec of the Black Moon Pack, vow my loyalty as your mate, your alpha and as your friend. I accept you as you stand. From this day forward, shall no one question our bond and position as Alpha and Luna.” Alec brought the chalice up to his lips and drank half of it. Handing it to Kristen, she took it and looked inside. “I, Luna Kristen of the Black Moon Pack, vow my loyalty as your mate, your luna and your friend. I accept you as you stand. From this day forward, shall no one question our bond and position as Alpha and Luna.” Bring the chalice to her lips, she emptied the rest of the cup before setting it down. They moved back to stand in front of the alter. “Ladies and gentlemen! Before us, Alpha Alec and Luna Kristen have confessed their love for each other. They have prepared a speech to address their pack and the room.” Alpha Thomas held his arms out to everyone. Alec and Kris turned to face everyone. Holding their heads up high, Alec started speaking as Kristen smiled widely. “These last few months have been trying and full of despair. Today marks a new beginning. Luna Kristen and I have worked tirelessly to create an everyon NG LUTTU CIVIC you, temnly you that we will not accept any form of treason… blatant disrespect towards the pack… or the idea of weakness. We are stronger together and will remain firm in our positions. We will rule with fairness but firmness. We are not weak and anyone else who believes otherwise will learn the same fate as our most recent enemies.”







Chapter 383

 The tent erupted in cheers. “I don’t understand why that needed to be said now.” I asked Colt in the mind-link. “There has been question if Alec is as strong of a leader as his dad. Regardless of what his dad did, he was allies with these Alphas. They need to know that he is just as strong and firm in order to keep the alliance. Alec and I have a long way to go to fully earn their respect and trust we can handle things.” “You too?” I looked at him shocked. “Oh yeah. I am a little more respected than Alec. Dad didn’t f uck things up the way Marc did at the end but died willingly. Dad had his affairs in order and spoke with these Alphas so they knew it was coming. However, I am still young and have only seen one enemy.” Colt looked at me as he spoke. The room drifted away as I focused on Colt’s face. “Will we need to say something similar?” I was more shocked than anything. “We will. Not quite the same but I’ll need to make a statement.” eyes shifted over to his sister. I was vaguely aware of them walking down the aisle. The sounds of the room came back to me, snapping me out of my thoughts. “That was really beautiful!” Emmy was wiping away her tears. “It was!” I agreed, quickly.

“What’s wrong?” Colt asked, in the mind-link. “Nothing is wrong. I just wasn’t fully aware of this. Some of this ruling stuff is still sinking in.” I just assumed we had respect until we lost it. reached out to the other lunas and tried to make nice. “I’ve let you do your thing. You said you didn’t really want to focus on that stuff so I didn’t force it. I was honestly waiting until school got going and your centers figured any and all kinks out before I put more stuff on you.” “Please help yourself through the food line according to your table assignments.” Alpha Thomas announced. We were table one so we noveldrama

were up. “Thank you.” I told Colt as he helped me stand. After I got food, these heels were coming off. Colt held my hand the entire way to the table but let it go as we reached for our plates. “Do you need me to fill a plate for you and come back?” He asked. “I think I should be okay.” Taking a plate, I started with some salad. Then I added some pasta to it before opting for a few different finger foods until my plate was full. Since wasn’t sure what any of it was, I just figured I’d try them all. Kris was pregnant too so I assumed it was all safe for me to eat. Walking carefully back to my seat, I was able to sit down before Co came over to me. “Why didn’t you wait for me?” He asked, slightly annoyed. “I’m sorry, I just wanted to get back to my seat.” “Jacob is here now. What would you like to drink?” “Lemonade or tea. Which ever is fine.” Colt leaned down and kissed my forehead before walking off. “Everything looks so good!” Emmy gushed as she sat down. “Do you have a bigger appetite since you gave birth?” I asked, honestly curious about postpartum. 270 “Oh, some. I get hungry more frequently but I don’t eat more. I think it evens out but I eat smaller more frequent meals than big meals.” “Interesting.” I said as I picked up something and ate it. After a few bites, it tasted like a blueberry tart, which was amazing. “Here you go.” Colt set down a glass of something yellow. That must be lemonade. “Thank you.” I said as I took a sip. It tasted amazing as it went down. “Jasper, how have you been feeling?” Colt asked as Jasper sat down with drinks for him and Emmy.







###Chapter 384

“Doing good. No limitations and we got decent sleep last night.” “It was the best. We slept for five whole hours.” Emmy nodded with wide eyes. “Five hours?” Jacob looked confused. “That’s it?” “Jacob, a newborn baby needs to eat every two to three hours. Basically, we put the baby to bed at lets say 8pm after being fed, changed and burped. Best case, the baby wakes up again at 11pm. It takes 30 to 45 minutes to feed him completely. Then you have to burp them and change their diapers. After that, they are possibly awake for another 30 minutes. Now it is like 12:30am. You have to rock the baby back to sleep and lay them in their crib. Now you are back in your own bed after you use the bathroom at 1am. Assuming you aren’t hungry, you can fall back asleep until 3am or 4am if you are lucky. Most of the time, it is every two hours they wake up.” “S hit.” Jacob rubbed the back of his neck. “I’m looking forward to it.” Colt said as he took a drink. My head snapped to his with a smile on my face. “You are?” Jacob asked.

“It isn’t forever. They don’t wake up that much for long. The first six months to maybe a year is rough but eventually it will even our and you get better sleep. That is why you have nannies or betas.” He joked. “I am not babysitting until that child can s hit by themselves in the toilet.” Jacob announced. I couldn’t help but laughing with the rest of the table. “One day, Jacob, one day.” Emmy said between breaths. “One day what?” Jacob challenged. “I will watch you eat your words and remind you of this conversation.” Emmy pointed her fork right back at him. “Colt, I need to use the restroom.” Leaning over, I whispered in his ear as Emmy and Jacob kept bickering. noveldrama

“Okay.” Colt cleaned his mouth off and stood up. Offering me his hand, I took it and stood up. “Where are you going?” Jacob rounded on me. “That bathroom so I can s hit in the toilet to make you happy.” I mouthed off before I turned around, unable to hide a smile. “Some times I really wonder about him.” I said to Colt. “Me too. We need to find a ga mma” Colt switched to our mind-link. “I know but how?” “Not sure. A tournament? Just appoint someone?” Colt suggested as we approached the bathroom. “Keep the link open and I’ll wait out here.” Nodding, we let go of eachother’s hands so I could go inside. “Who would you appoint?” “I’m not real sure. Ma-” Colt stopped talking and I heard him start speaking with someone else. He must have been approached by another alpha. Just as I sat down to pee, the door opened and a few more girls came in. “Did you see her? She looked like a stick was shoved up her as s!” One girl said. “Maybe I will just flirt with Colt and get her out of the way!” Another LUINITY “Shh, you need to play your part! There is so much at stake here and I don’t want any f uckups!” Another one chastised. “Oh please! They are both so focused on Vin that they don’t realized what is happening under their own noses.” The second one laughed. SLAP! The sound of flesh hitting flesh echoed off the walls. “That is enough! Let’s go before we get caught!” S hit! I tried to clean myself up as much as possible but the door opened and closed. “Colt! Stop those girls!” I yelled in the mind-link. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for being a loyal reader! I like it








###Chapter 385

 “What?” Colt asked me, slightly distracted. By the time he finally responded, I had pulled up my panties and quickly made it to the door. “The girls…” My eyes frantically looked a round to see who it could have been. “What’s wrong?” Colt asked. He grabbed my arm and pulled me to the side. “There were three girls in there. They said something about a plan being in play and they had a part to play.” I whispered urgently. My eyes never left the room as they continued to scan. “Do you know who they are?” Colt stood up straight and looked around. However, he kept his arm around me. “I don’t.” “Okay, lets head back to the table. Colt said as he slipped his arm fully around me and pulled me to the table. “Penny, we are thinking about having a girls night. You in?” Kris was standing by the table as we approached. “Of course! That sounds like fun. When?” “Not sure yet but I’ll let you know. We have a busy couple weeks but I am thinking maybe on a school night.” Alec came up to Kris with a drink in his hand. I couldn’t help but notice how little her belly was. Still completely visible as a pregnancy but not near as big as mine. “Oh, a school night..” Playfully, I gave her a naughty look as I took a sip of my lemonade.

“I like to live on the dangerous side.” Kris laughed. “We can do it at my house.” I offered. “What will the guys be doing?” “I think they will have a little hunting trip.” Kris id in a way that made me realize it wasn’t for an animal. “Interesting.” Was all I could say. s

“Colt. We need to speak with Alpha Thomas about Penny’s luna ceremony.” Alec stated. “Alright, I’m coming.” Colt looked at Jacob and he moved so he was sitting at a different angle. His whole demeanor changed as the guys. walked off. “I need to make my rounds. I’ll be right back.” Kris said as she walked off. “I’m sorry, Penny. I need to go pump. We will be right back.” Emmy and Jasper got up and walked out another door. My eyes followed her out the door but spotted three girls huddled together. Excitement suddenly filled me as I think I might have found the girls just by their posture. As soon as the door started closing, they started walking down the hall. “Where are you going?” Jacob did a double take as I got up and started walking quickly to the door. “Going for a walk.” I said without looking at him. “You can-” “Shh!” I put my finger to my mouth and quieted him. As we got into. the hallway, I grabbed his arm and pulled him along side of me. “What is going on?” He whispered in my ear. We were making our way down the same hall I saw the girls go. “There was three girls in the bathroom that said they had a plan in play. I want to know what plan that is.” I said back. My shoes were 1214 “We should go sit back down and let Colt handle this.” Jacob said, urgently. “If you are scared, you can leave.” said with a new found sense of adventure. “I’m not scared for me, I’m scared for you.” Jacob looked down the hall. Handing him my shoes, I just ignored him and kept walking. This was much easier and I felt more secure as the hallway started to incline. “Do you hear them?” I asked. “Maybe…” Jacob kept looked back like he hated everything about this. My curiosity was getting the better of me.

“Don’t f uck this up, Mary!” I heard a girl yell. “I won’t!” She answered like she was tired of being told this. “What is the plan again?” The second girl asked. “Penny won’t be dancing so I will be able to ask Colt to dance. While we are dancing, you are suppose to cause a disturbance and then I will be able to inject Colt with the poison.” “Good and you?” “I will be by Penny. When the distraction happens, I’ll inject Penny with this sleeping stuff and that will alow our men to take her.” Jacob wrapped his arm around my mouth to keep me quiet. Plastering me against the wall, I started to panic. “I’ll talking to Colt. Be still.” Jacob whispered so low in my ear that I wasn’t sure if I dreamed it. “Perfect. Here are your syringes. Be careful and do not poke yourself.” “This is so exciting!” I heard footsteps echo getting louder. Jacob didn’t say anything but grab me under the arms and pull me down the hall. I was lucky that my shoes were already off. Suddenly, I was ripped to the side and pinned against the wall. “Don’t move.” Jacob said in a voice that really had me trembling. Two strong arms had firm grips on my arms to the point that it almost hurt. There will be bruising tomorrow. However, a few seconds later, there was some commotion and a few screams and grunts. Words were not coming to my mouth as I tried to look but I was held firmly against the wall. There was a loud bang to our left and I was suddenly tossed to the right as the warrior engaged into a fist fight. It only lasted a second but the smell of blood was everywhere. noveldrama









###Chapter 386

 “Penny!” Colt’s voice came from somewhere but I was focused on the dead man on the floor. “Look at me!” Sparks ran across my face as Colt grabbed me and forced me to look at him. “W-what?” “Are you okay?” “Oh, yeah.” I said as I snapped out of my head. “I don’t know I have seen someone kill someone before. I’ve seen dead bodies, of course but not them actually get killed.” “Is she going into shock?” I heard Alec asked. “Penny?” Colt cupped my face and stepped in front of the dead man. “I-“My mouth moved a few times but nothing came out. “It’s okay.” Colt said. “JACOB!” “Right here.” “What happened?” Alec asked. “Emmy left to pump or something and Penny said someti seeing some girls in the hallway? She took off after them and couldn’t get her to come back. That is when we ran into the held her back as we overheard them plotting to kill you by injec poison and inject Penny with something to put her to sleep to ki her.”

“Did you get the girls?” I asked, looking at them. Three pairs of ey looked down at me. “We did. They are being transferred to my cells.” Alec said. “Was it much of a disturbance?” “Minor but we were able to keep it mostly quiet.” Jacob looked at Alec and Colt. “Good. Alec, this ceremony is for you too. I don’t want people to know something just happened. Jacob can escort me back to our table. Alec and go forward like nothing happened and Colt can join us when

this is all settled.” Colt and Alec shared looks before nodding. “Okay. We can do it that way.” Colt said. “Are you okay?” He looked down at me and put his arm on my shoulder. “I’m not a child.” I said, instantly annoyed. Shrugging off his hand, I turned to walk back to the party. “I got it.” I heard Jacob say before he took off after me. My emotions were all over the place but I couldn’t really figure out why. I didn’t want to be angry but I was. Men tally, I know Colt wasn’t treating me like a child so why did I get angry fast? Was that the pregnancy? That would explain what was going on with Emmy. Thankfully, no one was at our table when we got back to it. “Penny, seriously, are you okay?” Jacob asked very quietly as I took my seat. He sat in Colt’s chair and put his arms on either side of me. If someone didn’t know us, they might think this was inappropriate. “I think so.” Picking up my lemonade, I really wished this was stronger as I sipped it down. “Do you need a doctor? Is the baby okay?” Jacob pushed. “Jacob, I need some quiet time.” Putting my elbows on the table, my head rested against them. “Who did this?” Jacob grabbed my arm and twisted it. Wanting to see what he saw, I looked over and noticed I was right. There was finger “That was quick.” I said and shrugged it off. “Who did it?” He asked again. “The guard that you handed me too. I probably have it on the other arm as well. It isn’t a big deal, they did save my life.” “Penny! Are you okay?” Kris came up to me in a hurry. Jacob backed off and Kris sat on my other side. She barely even noticed Jacob. “I’m fire. Honestly just trying to wrap my head around it.” “Is there anything you need?” Kris asked me, more urgently. “I honestly don’t know what I need. Maybe once I rested.” “You look really pale.” Kris looked at me worriedly. noveldrama

“I’m actually kind of dizzy.” The lemonade slipped from my hand and crashed on the table. Thankfully, Jacob was quick and kept it from fully spilling but Kris was able to catch me before I fell over. “We need to get her to a hospital.” Kris said, urgently. “Carry her to my car.” She told Jacob. I was vaguely aware of his hand wrapping around me as my head fell over on his chest. “I already mind-linked Colt but we aren’t waiting.” I heard Jacob tell Kris. Black spots danced in my vision and I was unaware of my surroundings. “Penny! Stay with me!” Kris yelled. I heard something slam before the ground started moving. It was hard to form a thought in my head a the whole world was spinning. I wasn’t sure how long I was in that car but bright lights and loud beeping caused more distress than the actual dizziness. People were moving my body each direction, yelling my name and even a few pinches on my arm. I could hear them yell my name but I wasn’t able The sound of fabric chredding was so loud that a single thought formed in my head. “My dress’. The dress was being cut open, exposing my body. Something cold was put on my stomach before ! heard the most amazing word. “Healthy.” That’s all it took and I let the darkness pull me under.

###Chapter 387

 “What’s going on?” I groaned as my senses came back to me. Sparks were running up and down my arm, making me aware that Colt was with me. “Penny!” I heard a high pitch voice that surprised me. “Colt?” I called out. “Right here, love.” “What happened?” I asked again as I tried to open my eyes. There was this constant beeping that was starting to annoy the s hit out of me. “I’ll find the doctor!” The high pitch voice said. I wasn’t quick enough to look and see who it was. Instead, I was looking at Colt’s worried eyes. “You fainted. The doctor was running different test. I was worried they managed to sp i ke your drink or something. I’ve been so worried.” His eyes filled with water before his head rested against my hand. Reaching around, the I.V. tugged but I placed my hand on his head. “I’m so sorry I worried you. What did the doctor say? Is our baby okay?”

“I think so. He hasn’t told me anything yet.” Colt looked up and there was some anger in there. “I’m assuming they are doing blood testing. Let them do their jobs.” The door opened and Kris walked in. “The doctor will be right in. Are you okay?” It looked like she had been crying. “I’m good. I am so sorry that your party was ruined.” “Your life and the life of that baby is far more important than any party.” Kris came up to my bed and sat down. They apparently had both been camped out beside me. “What happened? At the party?” I asked looking between them.

“The girls were caught. Their men attacked but we were ready and. took them out quick enough. There was actually very little disturbance at the party. Most people didn’t even know something happened.” Kris said with a shrug. “I hear someone is awake.” The door opened and a taller but skinny man walked in. His hair was pretty grey but still had some black in there. Wrinkles lined his face with all the years of experience he had. “Is she okay?” Colt said as he stood up. “She is fine. No signs of sleeping poison or anything that shouldn’t be there. Your levels are actually very normal.” “Then why did she faint?” Colt pushed. “Pregnancy hormones can increase the heart rate and the blood supply in the body. Blood vessels relax and that can cause you to faint. Couple that with you being in shock from watching someone die, your body just fainted. Now, currently, I don’t see anything to worry about but fainting in pregnancy can be in result of something. more serious. Pay attention to any dizziness or excessive bleeding but I’m not going to list you as high risk just yet. Take it easy and don’t over do it.” “That is a relief.” I said to the room but no one in particular. “What about the baby?” Colt kept pushing. “Well, do you guys want to know everything I found out?” The doctor asked as he walked over to a monitor and turned it on. - “Yes.” Colt said in controlled anger. It was clear he wasn’t happy but the doctor ignored him. “Here is the sonogram we took when Luna Penny was brought in.” The doctor started. “Holy s hit!” Kris’s eyes were wide as she looked at the monitor. “What?” I looked between her and the screen. “Triplets.” The doctor said simply. “This is baby A, baby B and this little one is baby C. Three separate sacks with their own placentas.” As soon as the doctor stopped speaking, the room fell silent. I just stared at the monitor in disbelief. “What?” Colt asked after a moment.

“Triplets. You are decently along but due to you both being alphas and there being three in there, it’s hard to predict your due date. I would like you to come back in a week or two for an anatomy scan and to see how they grow. I have the genders from the blood draw if you want to know?” He looked between us. noveldrama









###Chapter 388

 “Do we?” Colt asked me, still in shock. My mouth opened but nothing came out. I couldn’t pull my eyes off the screen. “Here.” The doctor turned off the monitor and ripped something from the machine. “These are the pictures of the sonogram. In this envelop are the genders of your babies. Opening them when you are ready, if you want to know. Luna Penny is free to leave but I am going to request she is on light duty and not push herself. Fainting in pregnancy isn’t uncommon but it can be a sign of some complications. Obviously, call me at anytime.” Colt took the envelop but just stood there. Kris didn’t move, I don’t think I even blinked and Colt was a statue. It wasn’t until the door opened again and Alec walked in that my eyes even shifted from the sonogram. “Is everyone okay?” He asked as he walked up to Kris. “Y-yeah! We are good. Penny is good. We… um… lets give them some privacy.” Kris jumped up and took Alec’s hand before running out of the room with him. “Triplets…” Colt said as he sat down in the chair. “That is what the doctor said…” I kept looking at each scan. There was some characteristics in each picture. The profile of each baby, maybe an arm or a leg. “I got three babies in there.” Colt turned and put a hand over my stomach. Leaning his head down, he rested against me. “No wonder I have been feeling so huge.” I said as put the picture down and looked at him.

“You look beautiful.” Colt smiled at me but didn’t move his head. “Do you want to know the gender?” asked and took the envelop from him. “It is whatever you want.” Colt said. noveldrama

“That’s not what I asked.” Smiling at him, it was both annoying and sweet. “Yeah but I want to do whatever you want. If you want it to be a surprise, that’s okay, too.” Colt finally lifted his head up and smiled at me. “I think I would like to know….” I said, partially unsure. “Okay.” Colt moved so we could both read the papers. With shaky hands, I was able to open the envelope. There a single piece of paper folded into thirds. Slowly unfolding the paper, there was a big bold letters that read: RESULTS. Under that was three separate lines. “Boy!” I said and pointed at the first line. At the end, the word boy was in big letters. “Two boys!” Colt said excitedly as he pointed at the next line. “Girl!” We said at the same time, looking at the third line. “Two boys and one girl!” Colt took the letter and stood up. A huge smile was plastered on his face. “I guess I will need to pick out more stuff.” I laughed. “You started picking stuff out?” Colt looked at me with so much love in his eyes. “I have.” “I love you.” Colt said as he came over to me and kissed me. “Take me home?” I whispered when he pulled back. “Of course.” Colt pulled the covers back and helped me get on my feet. “Oh, my dress. I assume it was cut off me?” I asked disappointed. “It was. Kris brought you some sweats and a t-shirt to wear though.” Colt grabbed what looked like a to- go bag that all werewolves carried in their trunks. Pulling out some jogger style leggins and a basic KISS t-shirt, I was able to get dressed.

“I can get a wheelchair for you.” Colt said as we walked out of the room. “He said take it easy, not become immobile.” Rolling my eyes, I walked to the front door. “Still you are car-” “No!” I almost yelled too loud. Looking around, we caught the eyes of a few people. “Shh!” Colt looked at me confused but didn’t push it. Only when we were in the car and headed home did he talk. “What was that about?” “I don’t want to tell people yet I am having triplets. I want to save that till my luna ceremony and have some sort of announcement.”










###Chapter 389

 “Tell everyone at once?” “Yeah, make one big announcement. Can you text Kris and tell her not to tell anyone?” I requested. “Of course.” Colt pulled out his phone and texted her as we drove one. The pictures were clutched in my hand. “It’s a good thing we have that third extra room.” I said when he put his phone down. “It really is.” “At least I get this whole pregnancy thing over and done with.” “What do you mean?” Colt asked. “You only want three kids?” “I don’t need to risk having six kids if we get pregnant again. Plus, three kids at one time is going to take us out.” “Maybe but I have faith we will handle it like pros.” Colt smiled at me. “I will remind you of that when we are crying on the floor with poop and baby vomit all over us and neither of us have showered in three weeks.” noveldrama

“That is a tad dramatic?” Colt rolled his eyes. “Oh no, just the right level of dramatics.” “Anyway, you will need to find a few assistants to help you since you will be working from home now.” Colt looked at me like he dared me to argue. “Fine. It’s not like we haven’t cleaned out our office anyway.” Rolling my eyes, I folded my arms under my chest. Colt’s eyes followed my “If you need anything else, you can always ask me to get it for you or you can have someone do it for you. “It will be easy enough to work out of the livingroom. We have a pop up table that can get set up and

allow me to put stuff on.” It wasn’t like I hadn’t planned on working from home more but I wasn’t prepared to be stuck there. “Go through and order what you we need for the babies. I guess we need three of everything.” Colt made a face like he realized how expensive this would be. “Now that it is real, I need to focus on what I actually want and not what looks cute. It’s harder since it is real now.” “You will do great.” Colt reassured me as we pulled into our house. “I am going to get you situated and then I need to head out. We are questioning the girls this afternoon, Alec is just waiting on me to be ready. That is, unless you need me here?” “No, I am good.” “I’m not leaving you alone. Kris is waiting inside.” Colt said as he helped me out of the car. “She can help me pick a few things out.” I was slightly relieved she was here with me. “Penny!” How are you feeling?” Kris looked up from her phone as wel walked in. “Good, just tired really.” “I got the recliner all ready for you.” Kris moved the pillow and blanket out of the way. Sitting down, she put the blanket around me and put the pillow behind my head. “Not that I mind being pampered but I am still capable of doing things for myself.” “Nonesense.” She waved me off. “You are pregnant too.” I reminded her. “Not with triplets!” “I am going to leave you girls to it. There will be a warrior standing. outside the doors. Do you need anything else?” Colt asked. “I don’t think so. I must have been passed out all night since the sun. is rising.” Η “Yeah…” Colt frowned. “Get some rest though. I’ll bring breakfast with me.” “Thank you, bro! Breakfast burrito please!” Kris waved him off as she laid down on the couch.

“I’ll see what I can do.” Colt rolled his eyes and looked at me. “Do your want anything?” “Biscuits and sausage gravy.” I requested. “Alright.” Colt said and walked out. Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading! I like it
















###Chapter 390

 Colt POV “You got away faster than I expected you to.” Alec muttered as I walked into his office. “They released Penny first thing morning after she woke up. Ice is sitting at home with her as she rests.” Sitting down in his chair, Alec barely spared me a glance. “I’m glad she is doing okay.” There was an awkward silence before Alec looked up at me and smirked. “I’m more surprised you aren’t sleeping. Triplets is going to be a handful.” It was all I could do but glare at him. He snorted and went back to his work. Leaning back, I just started thinking about all the bottles I was going to need, all the diapers and all the clothes. “Triplets aren’t going to be that bad.” I finally said. “How far along is she?” “The doctor wasn’t really sure. We are both alphas and that will make the pregnancy move quicker. We have another scan soon to see.” The bottle of whiskey in the corner of the room caught my attention. Getting up, I just took a swig and felt myself relax. “Little early?” Alec set his pen down and stood up. “Might as well get used to my days and nights being mixed up.” noveldrama

“Once the shock wears off, you will be just fine.” Alec slapped his hand on my shoulder. “I’m like excited and scared s hitle ss. I was wanting a baby. A baby. I wasn’t expecting three. I’m just freaking out a bit. I’ll be okay, I just “Do you know what you are having?” “I do but Penny wants to keep it all a secret. Even the fact we are. having triplets and she wants to tell everyone at her luna ceremony.” “I’ll bring the whiskey.” Alec shook his head as we headed out and to the cells. “How far along is Ice?” “About twelve weeks.”

“Four kids running around. You know, if your child looks like Ice and my kids look like me, they will look like siblings and not cousins.” “How about we just question the girls and go eat.” Alec rolled his eyes at me. “The girls requested breakfast.” “Let me guess, Kristen wants a breakfast burrito?” “Correct.” “Make it sausage with no bacon.” “No bacon?” I asked. “Bacon makes her stomach roll.” Alec sighed. “Found out the hard way.” We walked into the cells and the smell always gets to me. It will never be something that doesn’t make me want to gag and throw up. Yet, I will forever not show a single ounce of weakness. Alec opened the door to the viewing room. “What do you want to do with them?” Alec asked as he crossed his. arms. Following his movements, I just stared at them. One moment, I was talking to Alpha Thomas about next week and then Jacob mind-links me that Penny is in danger. To think, if I was just a moment later, she could have been in serious trouble. Her and my three kids. “They are women is beating the s hit out of them might not work.” “We need to find the weak one and focus on her.” Alec was scanning them, trying to find who it was. “Start on the nails. Females are more vain than men. They will care more about permanent scaring and their looks.” Thankfully, their hands were easily accessible. “Pliers are on the table. This is your show.” Alec looked at me. Pushing Penny from my mind, I put my game face on and allowed the anger fill me. “Morning, girls.” I said as I walked into the room. My eyes went black and I didn’t even try to change them. My wolf was pi ssed and wanted blood.

” F uck you, dude.” The middle one said with more venom than I expected . Her eyes never left me as I stood in front of them. The one on the left kept looking between Alec and myself. The one on the right. was looking at the ceiling. “That was a pathetic attempt on Luna Penny’s life.” I said.








###Chapter 391

 “And yours.” Alec reminded me. “Ah yes, didn’t even get close to me. Nodding, I watched their reaction. The middle one rolled her eyes and leaned back. The left one snorted and the right kept looking at the ceiling. “Some might say that your heart wasn’t actually in it. You wanted to fail. Talking in the open like that was st upid. Such a rookie move to talk about it in the woman’s bathroom.” “I told you to shut the f uck up!” The girl on the right turned her head. and truly glared at the girl in the middle. It took my by surprise to see that kind of anger in her. The most interesting part is how her voice didn’t rise at all but stayed the same deep angry level from start to finish. The girl on the left slightly flinched and I found the weak one. “I don’t have to listen to you anymore!” The girl in the middle stated firmly. “You girls are rogues?” I could smell the hint of rotten rogue. They haven’t been rogues long. “Why do you care? Just kill us and move on.” The girl in the middle said but this time I heard more of a shake in her voice. “Tell me what I want to know and I will make your death quick.” I said simply. “Again… f uck you.” She looked at me like I was s tupid.

“Okay.” Walking over to the table, I grabbed the pliers and made a show of them. “What are you going to do with them?” The girl in the middle was eyeing me like it was a rabid dog that I was going to let loose. Walking up to her, I bent down. Grabbing one of her fingers, I forced it out and grabbed her nail. “Last chance.” She looked at me and back to her nail. “I have nothing to say!” There was a fake bravo in her voice. Without saying anything else, the pliers pinched down and I pulled firmly until the entire nail came off.

“F UCK!” Blood started dripping down to the floor. “Oh, shut up. That is nothing.” The girl on the right rolled her eyes. Alec walked over with a knife and carved an B on her cheek. “There. Carved Black Moon crest on your cheek. Forever marked.” “S ON OF A BI TCH!” She cried. “You have no idea what you just did!” The middle girl looked at the blood running down her face as she screamed. Using the distraction, I grabbed another nail and ripped it off with ease. “S HIT!” Her body started thrashing. “We had to do it!” The girl on the left cried. “Keep talking.” I said. “Shut up!” the girl on the right looked over at her and yelled. “Keep talking and it will be your eye next.” Alec pointed the knife at her. She eyed the knife but shut up. “You were saying?” I pushed. “We…we were part of Alpha Rip’s pack. After he died, our mates took us and we ran. Now, we serve Vin.” There it was. Vin. The man I can’t wait too kill. “He sent three females to do his dirty work?” I tried to make my voice sound like I didn’t “We aren’t useless.” She glared at me. “I’m prepared to give you what ever you want in order to live.” “What ever I want?” I asked, confused. “Sexually.” The girl in the middle said as her breathing leveled out. “Your mates wanted you to offer your bodies to us so you live?” I clarified. “Yeah. I’ll sleep with you and they will come save us.” I had to take a step back. “Let me get this straight. If you get caught, you are suppose to sleep with us which will tell them you were caught cause they will feel it. Then, they will come and try to kidnap you back?”

###Chapter 392

“They love us.” Her face fell. “Grow up. We were dead the moment they sent up into that party.” The blood face girl said. “My mate loves me!” She cried. “If he loved you, you wouldn’t be here right now. Our only shot was to be victorious and get in Vin’s good graces. We will die here and Vin will kill our mates for us failing.” She continued, accepting her fate. “I don’t want to die!” The girl in the middle had tears coming down her face. “Tell us what we want to know and I’ll spare your life.” I said and knelt down in front of her. I looked at her like a father would look at his daughter. Women broke differently than men. Well, some women. “You’re not getting s hit from us!”

Alec took the knife and carved an M on her other cheek. She flinched and tried to thrash around, which just resulted in her getting her ear cut off. “Should have hold still.” The entire side of her face was covered in blood. “I-I can’t!” She kept looking at at her friend. “Goo-” Alec ripped the knife across her neck in one swift movement. Blood squirted out her neck, drenching Alec from the waist down in her blood. It only took a few seconds but eventually her eyes roll back after failed attempts to talk. eto “S-she’s dead!” The girl in the middle looked at her friend in horror. “I’ll make your death quick and painless if you tell us what we want to pivnicu. run young picuouie un wunny momen “Vin said if we were able to capture Penny, then we would be rewarded. He gave us the poison and told us how to do it.” Tears fell down her face, almost making me feel bad for her. Almost. “Where is he working out of?” I asked. noveldrama

“No idea. He met us at our house. The three of us lived in a tent in a camp. Vin would come to us and give us assignments. This was our first one. Our mates had a few but since we were girls, we would be able to get closer to Penny. He said you would have less reservations about girls talking to girls.” “Do you know what else he has planned?” “I don’t. I promise! They didn’t tell us anything. Just that he wanted us to drug Penny, kill you and take Penny to a drop off. We had men around that when we said we were moving in were to start attacking.. Which, they did and you took out.” Her eyes were pleading with me to understand. “She is telling the truth. We don’t know anything.” The girl on the left cried. Alec walked over and slowly sliced the girls neck. There was a whole minute that she looked at us, begging us to spare her as she bled out. Eventually, her eyes rolled back and she took her last breath. “Last chance. Do you know anything else?” I pushed. She didn’t even watch as her friend bled to death. Instead, her eyes were squeezed shut as tight as she could make them. Still, that didn’t stop her from hearing her friend choke on her own blood. “F UCK! There was a meeting we were suppose to go to. It was tonight at midnight in the middle of the forest. I don’t know where, just that it was happening!” Putting the pliers on another nail, I kept pushing. “Are you sure you

“Are you girls good here?” I asked as I finished lacing up my black combat boots. “What exactly do you think you are going to do? Walk around the forest in hopes of finding this meeting?” Penny wasn’t the most. understanding about us leaving. “She isn’t wrong. Do you even have an idea of where it might be?” Ice frowned from the couch. “We have a general idea.” I still haven’t told either one of the girls. about my own spy. He had been following them so we actually have a very good idea of where this is going to be. The tricky part is going to be going without being noticed. “Jasper and Emmy will be here shortly. Just try to relax and enjoy your night.” Giving Penny a kiss on the forehead, we stood up to leave. “Please be careful.” Ice grumbled. “What’s wrong? You know we can’t not go!” I begged her with my eyes to understand. “I hate being left behind. I want to go on an adventure!” “You are pregnant. Absolutely not.” Alec said after he kissed her.

“Not too pregnant to do other things.” She rolled her eyes at Alec and leaned back on the couch. “Just come back safely.” Penny was worried. As much as I tired to push reassuring feelings towards her, she was still on edge. Walking up to her, I put my hands on the arm rest and got eye level но творышу чи رقاقات i promou you muc and alive. We will be as safe as humanly possible. I am way too excited for these babies to let anything happen to me. I will be careful, you enjoy an evening with everyone and don’t move from this chair. Jacob is your personal ser vant tonight.”

“Too bad your not my personal se rvant tonight.” Penny put her hand on my neck. Leaning against her ear, “I’ll be your personal s ervant in bed when I get home.” “Perfect.” She smiled widely as I stood up straight. “Jacob, if she gets so much as a paper cut, I’ll break your arm.” I said as we walked out. “A paper cut?” Alec half laughed as we walked to my car. “Just popped into my head.” I said as I started my car and pulled out of the driveway. “How was he able to find out the location of this meeting?” Alec asked. “Didn’t ask.” “I got everything you asked for.” Alec had a few different techy items that would come in handy. “Good. I want to record this or just hear it better. We might have to stay a distance back. “This should do the trick.” Alec said as he turned it on to make sure it was working correctly before turning it back off. We rode in silence for about fifteen minutes before I pulled over on a dirt road. Turning my engine off, we got out quietly and put our face masks on. Our entire bodies were covered in back. Even our eyes shifted so we beside me, I wouldn’t have known he was there. Slowly, we made our way until Alec reached out a hand and stopped me. Alec motioned he heard something. My adrenaline was racing as we crept to the left. After a step or two, I started hearing what Alec heard. It started out as whispering but eventually, it became clear. “….nicely done.” I knew that voice. That was Zac. “Gunther will be so proud of me!” Ice ran through my veins at the sound of the second voice. It couldn’t be right. We crept forward. Alec nudged me. Looking down, he handed me his night vision binoculars. “You can’t tell him yet. Let me adjust this.” Zac said. My eyes looked right at her but I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. “I have to give this to him!” Kara

was arguing with Zac. “I already told him that I got it.” noveldrama









###Chapter 394

“I told you not to do that!” Zac glared at her. “We had a plan. I thought you wanted to help Gunther. If you give this to him, there will be no saving Gunther.” “I have to! He is starting to not trust me! He-he will have to break up with me if I don’t help him! He loves me but he can’t save me if I keep failing!” Kara was crying. “Stop crying. I have zero sympathy for whiny girls. Don’t make an enemy out of me. I am trying to help you.” Zac was playing her like a fiddle. “Let me see if I can make some adjustments to it real quick before we head to the meeting.” “You know about the meeting?” Kara asked, shocked.

“I’m surprised Gunther is allowing you to go.” Zac looked at her. “He is introducing me to everyone. Since I got this for him, I have earned my place there.” “Breaking into Colt’s office allowed you to stand with them?” Zac asked as he took a pen and was drawing on whatever she took. “I did it once, I can do it again. I didn’t have much time to look but now I know how to do it, I can do it again.” Kara looked proud and ambitious with her mission. My stomach completely dropped as listened to her talk. This was not the girl I once was involved with. “If this goes well, I will need to have a meeting with Gunther myself. We will need to come up with a plan of action.” Zac kept messing with the paper and not even looking at Kara.. “I don’t know… he might not go for that and then he will know I was working with you and he will be so mad.” “What you need to tell him is that Colt is no longer living at the packhouse. Him and Penny are living in a rental property so the pack house is completely exposed. In the middle of the night, you will allow Gunther to sneak in and look around the office himself. That will show him that you are in it for good. With this, they will trust you so Gunther will have no issue meeting me.”noveldrama

That mother f ucker is going to die. Either by my hand or my wolf. When this is over, he will not be breathing. As the shock wore off, anger settled in. Was Kara just dating Gunther? Come to think of it, I am pretty sure my guy said Gunther had a mate or at least someone he was f ucking around with. How did they even meet? “Are you about done? The meeting will start soon and I need to get going or I will be late. That will look really bad for me.” Kara crossed. her arms like she was cold and looked around. Her face told me how scared she was right now. Part of me wanted to help her as she was a pack member but the other part knew she was committing treason and would be dealt with accordingly. The mate bond is strong but she could very easily come up to me and tell me she was in a situation and needed help. She is choosing this life, this path and she choosing wrong. “Here. I am done. You need to get going. I am going to follow you so we aren’t seen together.” “Good!” Kara was clearly relieved as she took whatever it was and rolled it up. Judging by the size and shape, it was the blueprints. What changes Zac made to it concerned me. Kara stomped off into the forest without worrying about who could hear her. Zac allowed her to get about fifty yards before he followed her. Not making a f ucking sound as he kept going. Alec and I started walking parallel to them. I kept an eye on Kara and Zac and Alec watched everything else. We weren’t sure exactly where this meeting

 I didn’t even need to ask Alec if he was recording. Not only could I make our the equipment but he was like an extension of myself. I trusted him with my life and knew he would get s hit done. “Gunther!” I heard Kara call out. She sounded excited and started running towards me. “Shh! Don’t yell!” Gunther got onto her but I was surprised by how gentle he was with her. “Did you come alone?” He asked as he pulled her into a huge. He was looking behind her like he knew someone. was there. Zac was behind a tree, not moving. “I did but look, I got it!” She stepped back and showed him what I suspect to be the blueprints. “This is great.” His eyes lit up as he looked at it. “What are these markings?” “No idea.” She answered that one honestly. “I figured out how to get into their office and I got that.” “Vin will like this.” Gunther said. “So what is the plan?” Kara asked nervously. noveldrama

“We will show this to Vin. He will want to do some recon and come up with a plan. Since the girls failed, Colt will know now we are after Penny. There will be no hiding that. Now we can attack head on.” “Did he expect them to actually succeed?” Kara asked, a little surprised. “What do you mean?” “I mean, Colt wasn’t going to leave her unattended and he wasn’t yunny w judi security.” Kara looked at Gunther like he was s tupid. “He sent them on a suicide mission.” “Or they walked up to him and presented him with a plan and he accepted the plan. Don’t think for one second that Vin actually thought three girls would be able to pull this off. He felt like it was too easy to just sn atch her and sell her. This way, Colt will put up a fight. and that is what makes it fun for Vin. He is like a cat playing with his food. Vin doesn’t give a s hit who dies as long as he gets what he wants in the end.”

“Does he think he is going to get Penny that easily?” Kara asked, sounding unsure. “Vin has more stuff in the works than you are even aware of and if you want to be part of this, you need to stop asking questions.” Gunther warned her. “I know, I know.” Kara shook her head. “Asking questions will make Vin think you are against him. I can’t tell you how dangerous this is by you meeting him. If he thinks you are going to run and tell Colt everything, he will kill you where you stand.” “I understand. I want to help you. We can be a family one day.” Kara put her hand on his chest. Gunther didn’t move but just looked at her.” If I need to put my life on the line to help you, I will.” “I shouldn’t even be allowing this.” Gunther bent over and kissed her before he took her hand and they started walking again. However, after a few steps, he let go of her hand and didn’t try to touch her after that. “I wondered where you went to.” Vin’s voice echoed, stopping Gunther in his tracks. “Spying on me?” Gunther recovered quickly. It was like he was at viriyisin porovni. “You brought a new person?” “Vin, this is Kara, Colt’s ex-girlfriend. She snuck into his office and was able to find this?” Gunther extended the paper to Vin but Vin was watching Kara. Slowly, he advanced on Kara. His hands touched her hair and moved down her arms. You could clearly see the annoyance and anger in Gunther but he didn’t try to stop him. Taking Kara’s hand, Vin kissed is as he looked into her eyes. “What pleasure and you are Colt’s ex?” Mrs. Smith Author Thank you all for reading!










###Chapter 396

 “Y-yes.” Kara was visibly shaking as her eyes darted between Vin and Gunther. “What do you have to offer me that Gunther felt like I wouldn’t kill you right here and right now?” Vin stopped walking behind her and placed his hands around her neck. “I brought you the blueprints. Maybe you can use them to kidnap Penny.” Her voice was barely above a whisper. If I didn’t have a view on her mouth, I probably would have missed that. “So, you want me to use you for inside information?” Vin let go and walked around to the front part of Kara. “Why exactly should I trust you? Who willingly is committing treason right now. If Colt knew of this, he would kill you.” “I-I don’t want Penny as my luna.” Kara was obviously lying. “You want me to trust that you are on my side?” Vin looked at Kara without blinking. “I am.” Kara kept her head high. “Prove it.”

“H-how?” Kara asked. Vin snapped his fingers and there was movement behind Kara. My eyes snapped over and realized that there was a few men wrestling behind a tree. They had Zac. It took three men to subdue him and drag his as s over to Vin. “This man has been a pain in my side for f ucking years. You li me when you told me you weren’t followed.” Vin looked at Kara. “I wasn’t aware we were.” Gunther shifted uncomfortably. “I know. You were too busy worrying about some used p ussy to pay attention.” Vin walked over and back handed Zac across the face. Gunther didn’t argue but looked at Zac with hatred. “If you want me to trust you, kill him.” Vin held out a gun to Kara. “What?” Her mouth dropped as she looked at the gun and then at Zac.

“Colt?” Alec whispered so low that I barely heard him. I looked at him. with wide eyes. What do I do? Save him? “F ucking da mmit.” I whispered back. We weren’t prepared for this. “Take the gun and shoot him.” Vin shoved the gun in Kara’s forcing her to grab it. chest Alec put away the equipment and we moved to get into place. Thist was not going to be an even fight. The only thing we had going for us was the element of surprise. I watched as Kara took the gun in her hands. They were shaking, making the gun move in all directions. “Come on, don’t let the little b itch kill me.” Zac groaned. “Would you prefer I do it?” Vin asked. “Either way, you are not seeing the sun rise.” “We can make a deal. You know I am Penny’s father.” “I don’t care if you are the f ucking Moon Goddess’s father. You have f ucking up more things for me and that stops tonight.” Vin growled. Shoot him!” Kara tried to hold the gun still but after a moment, she dropped t gun. “I can’t!” She cried. “It wasn’t even f ucking loaded.” Gunther glared at her. Alec and I w just about in place when Vin picked the gun up. “I guess you aren’t as with me as you thought.” Vin pulled a clip out from his pocket and put it in the gun Pulling my knife out, I gave Alec one last nod before we jumped into action. Alec took the three guys holding Zac and I took Vin. I had one shot at this before all hell broke lose. Vin saw me at the last moment and turned. The gun went off as I leaped, grazing my cheek. Slicing down, Vin and I went rolling a few times before both of us jumped up. The gun was laying between us. Gunther had grabbed Kara and was holding her back. “Well, well, well. Isn’t this a nice surprise. The man I wanted to kill.” I felt the blood running down my cheek but I also saw blood dripping down his arm. “Looks like you are the one in danger.” I gloated. Alec managed to gut the last one but punched Zac sonoveldrama

I want to kill this f ucking piece of trash by my own. hands.” I pointed my knife at Zac. “It has nothing to do with him being Penny’s father?” Vin gloated. He was stalling and I could hear the running footsteps. “Better get that arm looked at, Vin.” Gunther lunged for the gun and that was my cue to leave. Alec had Zac over his shoulders. Not caring about the noise we were making, we ran. The gun fire started going off. Tree bark flew around me. Either Gunther was a terrible aim or he wasn’t aiming to kill. It sounded like a f ucking army behind us. Men were shouting and more bullets started flying. “F uck! If we die for that piece of f ucking s hit!” I yelled. Our car came into view. Opening the back door for Alec, I got in the drivers side and turned the car on. By this time, we could clearly see dozens of men running towards us. Bullet were peppering the windshield as I waited for Alec to tell me to go. “You in?” I asked looking back. “GO! GO! GO!” Alec groaned.

 “Just a graze.” I said trying to control my anger. I knew my eyes were still black. “I know who.” I said without finishing it. Penny looked shocked and put her hands on her hips. “Who?” She asked, understanding what I meant. “Kara.” Penny’s eyes got wide as she took a step back. “No!” “What about Kara?” Ice got past Jasper and walked up to me. okay?” Alec “Warriors!” I yelled, ignoring the girls. “Get in stations.

receding. “It doesn’t look back but we do need to cauterized it and stitch it up.” The doctor said. “I’m not going under.” Alec said firmly. “I would recom-” The doctor started. “I would suggest you numb it really good and get to work. I am not going under. Especially if we get attacked and I am not able to help.” Alec said with his full authority. “Yes, Alpha.” The doctor nodded and soft hands pulled me from the room. “Colt, let them stitch your face up.” Penny pulled me to room and put me on the bed. “What happened?” She asked as the nurses got to work cleaning my face. “She is Gunther’s mate. She must have been the girl in the pink wing.” “How wo-” Penny started pacing. Trying to wrap her hand around it. “Penny, sit down.” I said as I watched her rub her belly. She ignored me. “Is that why she asked for a more hands on job at my clinics? To get more familiar with it?” “Penny!” I yelled to get her attention, “What?” She looked at me like I was st upid. Even the nurses jumped. “Sit down.” I said and pointed to the chair. She rolled her eyes but sat down. By this time, the nurse was putting stitches in my cheek. “This looks partial cauterized.” She said more to herself. “That is because it was made by a bullet.” “A bullet?” Penny Jumped up and looked more at my wound. “I can’t wait to f ucking kill Vin.” It was all I could do to roll my eyes. “Alpha! Someone is approaching the gate!” My warrior mind-linked me. “Someone is coming to the gate, get this s hit out of my face!” |

commanded. “Colt, what if it’s Kara?” Penny looked scared. “Done!” The nurse said. “Stay here.” I told Penny as I jumped out of the bed and stated taking off. “Colt!” Penny shouted. “Warrior!” Grabbing one guy by the shirt, I pulled him to me. “Keep her here and f ucking safe or it will be your head.” “Yes, Alpha.” He nodded. “Be safe!” Penny yelled. I turned and gave her a look. “Love you.” I said before walking out of the hosptial. “Jacob! Front gate!” I said in the mind-link. I got into my car as Jacob came running out of the hosptial. “What’s going on?” He said as I peeled out before he was even off the ground. “Someone is coming to the gates.” “What happened man?” Jacob asked as I floored it.













###Chapter 399

 “We walked up and witnessed Zach speaking with Kara. Kara was the one trying to break into my office. The cameras have only caught someone in pink hair. She is mated to Gunther and was helping them.” “Holy s hit.” “Zac got caught and we had to save him and here we are. Man, this whole thing is so f ucked up right now. I don’t even know what to think.” I said as we pulled up to the gate. My guards had their guns at full draw, pointing beyond my territory. “Alpha, we have them at gunpoint.” My warrior announced as we walked up. “Colt… please!” Kara had black tear stains down her face. Gunther was sporting a fresh bullet hole in his side but was on his knees with his hands behind his head. Although he was pale, he looked like he just had a flesh wound. “That is Alpha to you.” I said firmly as I walked out to see them. noveldrama

“Please, he is bleeding! Gunther got shot and he is dying! Please save him. I love him!” Kara begged. Gunther looked over at her and buried his eye brows. “It’s a flesh wound.” “Why are you here? I should kill you both right now.” I wasn’t in the mood to play. “A-alpha?” Kara looked stricken at me. “Did you really think I wasn’t aware of you sneaking into my office? If I go to your room, I won’t find a pink wig?” Kara looked taken aback. “You knew?” “Of course I knew. There are security cameras up and your little note. did nothing.” “You tipped him off?” Gunther looked at Kara like she betrayed him. “I did it for you! You didn’t want this life! I had to do something to get you out of it! YES! Yes I broke into your office to steal information, but I put the note there because I didn’t want Penny’s life in danger. I

thought if I tipped you off, that you would up her security and she would be safe. I-I still got the information to give you so you would give it to Vin so he thought I was on his side. That way, I could keep leaving notes to warn you, Alpha. Then I ran into Zac. He said he would help me. He altered the papers I stole so Vin wouldn’t have the correct information. I don’t even know what I stole. It looked important. It had Penny’s buildings on it. I asked Penny for a job so l could help keep people safe. I just wanted to save Gunther and save the pack I love.” Kara was barely audible by the end of it from all her crying. “You admit to committing treason. You willfully gave evidence to the person actively trying to kill your luna. Then there is you, Gunther. You have done so many things that warrant your death. Yet, you kneel before me, asking what exactly?” “To hear me out. Wait until I have confessed everything and then. pass your judgement. I do not come here willingly, nor do I want to be here. However, I had to make a choice…. the mate bond or Vin.” “Just like that? You expect me to believe that you had a change of heart in the matter of minutes? In the time all hell went loose, your expect me to believe that you are now on my side?” “I’m not on your side. I am on the side that keeps me alive.” Gunther said honestly. At least he was honest. “You will be treated at the hospital and then moved to cells for interrogation.” I said firmly. “What?” Kara looked at Gunther with wide eyes. “You can’t! He is a good person!” “He has done unspeakable crimes!” I bellowed. “How many women did he rape before he met you? How many women and children did he slap or abuse in any form?” I just looked at her with so much anger that she cowered back. Gunther didn’t even argue or fight as the guards picked him up and drug him away.






###Chapter 400

 “J-just please don’t kill him. That will kill me too.” Kara hiccuped as her tears ran dry. “How did you even meet Gunther?” I asked openly. I still had an audience and Jacob was standing beside me with as much anger in him as I felt. “After….after you mated Penny…. I… um… I went to a bar to get drunk. My heart was in pieces and you didn’t even seem to care. Just tossed me to the side like a piece of trash. So, I went to get drunk like everyone else does. Only, I was dancing and the mate bond is strong. We never even said a word to each other until after we were marked. I think it took us both by surprised. Now, we are in a situation that we don’t know how to fix.” Kara kept her eyes pointed downward like she was embarrassed about it. “Why didn’t you just come to me? You could have easily came up to me and explained the situation. All this could have been avoided. You put your life on the line.” I was so disappointed in her actions that I felt like I didn’t even know her in this moment. She used to be a fighter. Now, she just looks like a broken down person. “What was I suppose to do? Walk up to my ex-boyfriend who easily cased me away… tell him that I got drunk, lost my virginity and mated with my mate who was our enemy? That would be a nice conversation.” She rolled her eyes as she started feeling some anger. “That is exactly what you should have done. You know I did not cast you to the side. We were not mates, I told you weeks before that we needed to take a step back and see where our future went. We both knew that if we weren’t mates that we would break up. We had multiple conversations about it. It hurt me too that we weren’t mates but Penny is who I was meant to be with. She is the one I gave my full actions.

“What are you going to do with me?” Kara finally asked after a moment of silence. “You will be placed in the cells into you are questioned and then I will decide your fate.” She didn’t even argue as the guards picked her up and carried her inside. Jacob and I stood silent for a few moments, just looking at the woods. My guards were now back at their post, waiting for us to come back inside before closing the gates. “Colt, I got the girls and Alec headed to the house.” Jacob finally said. “Alec?” “He left against medical advice. Doc just finished stitching him shut but he said he is fine so he is leaving.” Shaking my head, I just walked pasted him and got into the drivers seat. Can’t say I wouldn’t have done the same. Besides, he did say this one wasn’t as bad as the first time. I wasn’t surprised we drove up at the same time as they did. Kris tried to help Alec out but he tried to act like he wasn’t in pain and help her instead. Jasper helped Penny out of the car before I could get there. “Did Jasper tell me that Gunther and Kara showed up?” Alec asked as we walked inside. I helped Penny to her chair an put a blanket around her. “Let’s talk outside.” I said and turned. “No.” Penny said quietly.” “No?” I turned and looked at her. The room went silent, waiting to see how this was going to play out. “It’s okay. I want to know.” Penny said, her voice barely above at whisper. “Are you sure?” “I am.” Penny nodded and crossed her arms.

“Okay.” Kris nodded and sat down as we stayed standing. “How’s the arm?” I asked, Alec. “I’ll live.” Alec blinked a few times and Ice just rolled her eyes at him.noveldrama









###Chapter 401

 “Gunther and Kara were at the gate. Gunther wants for us to hear him out before we kill him and Kara is begging for his life. Gunther said that he had to chose between the mate bond and Vin so he is unable to go back to Vin.” “He would rather die at our hands than Vin’s.” Jacob chimed in. “Is he expecting to live?” Alec asked. “No. He just wants to be heard. I think he wants to plead his case to I don’t kill Kara.” “This is a random change of heart. Yesterday he was fully ready to kill us.” Jasper said. “I’m wondering if he doesn’t have alternative motivations. However, he can’t walk free.” I said even though I wasn’t sure how to handle this situation. “I agree. Was he injured?” Alec asked. noveldrama

“He was. He is at the hospital right now getting fixed and then taken. to the cells.” I confirmed. “What about Kara? What did she say?” Penny asked. We all looked at her before speaking. “She said she got drunk and went to a bar. She found him and mated him without speaking to him. She claims she had no idea who he was before they mated. Now, she is stuck with him.” I summarized. “I mean, I can see that. Alot of people get drunk and make st upid decisions when they are hurting or upset.” Ice said in Kara’s defense. That surprised me as she was never a fan of Kara. “I don’t disagree with you but that doesn’t excuse her trying to break Into my office and steal information to give to Vin.” I countered. “True but what if she was doing it to help get Gunther out?” Ice asked. “I’m just saying, there might be more to her story than she has said.” “Maybe Gunther put her up to it. We all know how strong the mate bond can be.” Penny said. “There is more.” I said as I faced Penny more. “Zac met with Kara

before she met up with Gunther. She gave Zac the blueprints that she stole and he altered them. Zac was playing both sides to get what he wanted. He was caught and that was the only reason why we intervened. Otherwise, we would have let that played out.” “Is he alive?” Penny asked after a moment of silence. “Yeah, that’s how I got f ucking shot. Carrying his f ucking a ss.” Alec tried to cross his arms but flinched and let it hang. Penny looked at Alec and back at me. It was hard to read her facial expression and her emotions were just as flat. “Thank you for saving him. I have begun to worry how many of his nine lives were up.” “He has at least one more but he is in the cells as well. He will ne to answer to his own treason.” I said to Penny. She didn’t argue wit me, nor did she pinch her lips together, like I expected. Instead, she just nodded and seemed to be deep in thought. “What happens now?” Ice asked. “Tomorrow, we will question the three of them and decide them. You girls will not be there.” I said firmly. “Okay.” Ice shrugged. It surprised me how easily she agreed to that. Glancing at Alec, he was even shocked by this. “Best I can offer is a video and audio.” I tried to make it a little better. “No need.” Penny shook her head. “Some things I don’t need to witness.” “I’m not going to kill anyone tomorrow. We are going to hear them out and see what they have to say.” I promised her. “What do you want to come of it?” Ice asked me. “No idea. I don’t know what to think. This is not how I thought tonight was going to go.” “Are you really going to sentence Kara to die?” Penny asked with zero emotions. Mrs. Smith Author

“She is no different than any other pack member at this point.

However, I will hear her out and see from there.” I wasn’t sure how any of this was going to work. “All I know is that we need to go to bed. Everything else will be dealt with tomorrow.”

“Alright. I’ll be back first thing in the morning.” Alec said and offered. me his hand.

“Sounds good.” I said and shook his hand. “Thanks, Jasper for everything.” I said and offered him my hand. He took it and nodded as

Alec and Jacob shook hands.

“Are we not family enough that you guys don’t have to be so professional?” Ice asked as she stood up.

“Showing respect isn’t always being professional.” I said as I gave her

a kiss on the cheek. “Get some sleep.”

“Yeah, okay.” Ice rolled her eyes and they left together.

“What did she want us to do? Hug it out?” Jacob shook his head.

“How are things with Sherry?” Penny asked.

“I don’t know. Thankfully, you guys have kept me busy so I haven’t spoken to her much.”

“Has she tried to talk to you about it?” Penny pushed.


“A little but she is still adamant that she is innocent. She didn’t want

to reveal that part of her life. She said she buried it and wanted to keep it there. Just wanted to move on and focus on her future.”

“I can’t say I blame her for that.” Penny tried to stand up. Offering her my hand, she got up easily and walked to the kitchen for some water.

“Guess not.” Jacob shrugged.

“Well, I’ll see you tomorrow.” I said, giving him an out.

“Alright.” Jacob put his head down and walked out the front door.

“Ready for bed?” I asked.

“Oh yeah. I’m exhausted.” I waited for Penny to walk up the stairs first. and then I followed her.

“I have a long day tomorrow.” I said as I undressed and got into bed. Penny just took her pants off and climbed into bed.

“That you do.” Penny agreed before we turned the lights out and went fell asleep with her in my arms.

The next morning, my alarm went off but Penny didn’t move. She had, curled up on her side of the bed with about three pillows under her stomach, knees and arms. Not to mention the two under her head. Where all these pillows came from, have no idea. However, she was still peacefully sleep so I tried not to wake her as I got up to shower.

Thankfully, I was done and dressed before the sounds of tires ca into my driveway. Penny was still completely passed out so I just them at the door.

“Good Morning.” Ice said as she walked in.

“Aren’t you chipper this morning.” I said, a little shocked. She came in and went right to the kitchen.

“Coffee.” Alec shook his head.

Penny is still sleeping.” I warned. “Isn’t coffee bad for pregnant people or something?”

“One cup isn’t going to give the baby an extra arm or leg.” Ice rolled her eyes.

“Don’t even try.” Alec sighed. “She is even more stubborn than before if that is even possible.”

“Didn’t think so.” I whispered back. “Like I said, Penny is sleeping. Try not to wake her.” I told Ice as we left. noveldrama

“Wouldn’t dream of it.” Ice frowned at me and closed the door behind

US.

“Where is Jasper?” I asked as we got into Alec’s car.

“Should be here in about five minutes. The baby was up last night and so he is running on minimal sleep.”

“Gotcha.” Alec and I both wore old shorts and tennis shoes that already had blood stains on them. We, also, matched with black t- shirts that would hide any blood that got on them. In total, nothing would be ruined from whatever might happen today.

“I assumed we will start with Gunther or Kara. Save Zac for last.” Alec

said.

“Gunther. I am really curious what he has to say.”

“Sounds good. I’ll be there if you need support but this is your s Alec said as we pulled up to the cells.

“How is the shoulder?” I asked. Getting out, Alec tried to move it b winced a little.

“Sore but okay.” Thanks to our alpha healing, he should be good soon. enough.

After nodding at the guards, we headed inside and down to the

interrogation rooms. Gunther was ready to go, chained to the chair and looking rather bored.

“Gunther.” I said as we walked in.















###Chapter 403

“About time. I was starting to think you forgot about me.” He looked at me and over to Alec. Alec just stood by the door with his arms. crossed in front of him. Grabbing a chair, I moved to sit in front of

Gunther.

“Alright, I’m here. Talk.”

“What if I had a change of heart?” Gunther asked.

“Then I will use the knife for awhile before either just killing you. No, actually, I will need to kill you in front of everyone. Make a show of

it.”

“There would be many happy people from that.” Gunther nodded and tried to shift but was held down tightly.

“How is the side?” I asked.

“Fine. Had worse.” Gunther sighed loudly.

“So, are you going to talk or what? You asked for this.” I pushed. could very easily move on to Kara and question her.”

“You wouldn’t dare touch her.” Gunther narrowed his eyes at me.

“She committed treason. I can and will do whatever I need to. Don’t tell me you actually have feelings for her.” I pretended to be shocked.

“She is innocent in all this.” Gunther said through gritted teeth. noveldrama

“Let’s start from the beginning. How did you meet her?” I asked, putting one leg over another, I just sat back like we were best friends.” At a club. I realised who she was after I looked at her on the dance floor. The bond was too strong and I couldn’t help myself. Now she is forced into this life. She is a good person, trying to get me out of this


แบง่ง

“Do you even want out?” I asked. “Domestic life isn’t for everyone.”

“I don’t know.” Gunther said after a moment and put his head down.” However, I want to be with her…”

“Why did you bring her to meet Vin?” That is what confused me. “You knew that was sealing her fate.

“I had no choice. Vin found out I was seeing a girl at my cabin so he told me to bring her with me. If Vin tells you to do something, you do it. Otherwise, there is a target on your back.”

“What is Vin’s plan?” I asked directly

“Find a way to get Penny and sell her. He is trying to rebuild the business that Darin had on the side. Selling girls to the highest

bidder.”

“He doesn’t want the alpha title?” I asked.

“The title lies with Penny. If he gets Penny, he can get the title easily enough and start fresh.” Gunther shrugged.

I wanted to asked how he would get it but I didn’t really want to k that answer. “What plans did he have?” I asked.

“Going to try to put more girls under cover in Penny’s newest projects. Maybe even just walk in and grab her himself.”

“This is all very vague and stuff we already knew.” I said looking

rather disappointed.

“Did you know that Vin already has another attack in place?” Gunther looked at me like he had an Ace.


“Act like I have no idea what you are talking about.” I shrugged, trying. to look like it wasn’t bothering me.

“At her luna ceremony. If he can’t get her, he will just kill her.”

That was just a in a few short days. “Details.”

“Don’t have any. Just know that he will try something that day.” Gunther looked up at the ceiling.

“So, you burnt your bridge with him?” I asked.

“Probably. Not fully sure but I believe so.”

“Does Vin have people watching and following his men?” I asked.

“Not following but he has cameras all around that he watched or has a warrior watch.” Gunther looked confused at my question.

Suddenly, I had a plan form in my head. In order for this to work, we would really have to trust and hope nothing bad happens. Now, if Zac, Gunther or Kara die in the process, it is what it is at this point.

“How bad do you want to live with Kara, outside of working with Vin?” Lasked.

Gunther narrowed his eyes at me as he studied me. “Why?”

have a plan.”

“What is it?” Gunther asked.

Standing up, I needed to speak with Zac first. “I’ll be right back.”

“Tell me what you meant!” Gunther yelled as I walked out.

Gong up to Zac’s cell, he was sitting up in bed. “Come here.” I said to him. Za listened but was weary about approaching.

“What?” He asked.

“I have a plan. told him in his ear to see if it was doable or not.














###Chapter 404

“You can’t be serious.” Alec looked at me like I was losing my mind..

“Do you have another plan?” I asked. We were walking out of the

cells. Before we walked to the outside world, I turned and looked at him.

“I don’t but this is mad. So many things could go wrong.”

“That is a risk I am willing to take.”

“This is your call but as your allie…as your friend… as your brother, I am telling you I don’t agree with this.” Alec stated clearly.

“Are you going to stand beside me?” I asked.

“Of course.” Alec didn’t even hesitate.

“Anything else you want to get off your chest? Once we leave here, we have to be a unit.” I asked.

“F uck man…. no.” Alec shook his head and took a few steps away from me before turning around.


“Good.” I said as I turned and walked out. “Make the announcement.”

Closing his eyes, both Alec and I made the same announcement to our packs. “Attention everyone! Report immediately to Blue Fang Pack for a public conviction and execution.” In a separate link, we addressed the warriors. “Warriors, fill your guns with the blue ammo.”

“Well, no turning back now.” Alec said as he looked up at the clouds. It was going to be a gloomy day.

“What the f uck is going on?” Penny yelled at me in the mind-link.

“Please, just trust me.” I begged.

“Do I even want to know?”

“Just have Jasper bring you girls to the jury plot.” I said. We watched as the guards brought up Gunther, Kara and Zac in chains. All of them had their heads down as they walked past us.

“Kristen is going to kill you.” Alec muttered as we followed.

“Take a number behind Penny.” I sighed.

As we approached, we saw pack members running around to get everything set up. The execution would be by whatever method I felt like it required. For this, I would just inject them with a poison.

To say I wasn’t nervous would be lying. However, on the outside, I kept it calm and collected. This was the right call. As more people showed up, the more I kept racking my brains for different options but in the end, this is what I felt like was the right choice. Was it dangerous, incredibly but if this worked out, everything will work out. The only person I felt bad that was in this situation was Kara. Still, she made her bed and now she can lie in it.

“COLT!” I heard Penny yell from behind me.

“This is your rodeo.” Alec muttered before we turned.

“Thanks, bro.” I said sarcastically back. noveldrama

“Can we talk about this?” Penny looked pis sed off.

Taking her arm, I pulled her to the back so we could whisper and not be overheard. “Please. Trust me and we will talk about this after.”

“Tell me now!” She stomped her foot. The action caught me off guard that I had to fight the urge to laugh.

“Penny. Please.” I looked her in the eyes and begged her. “Baby, I

point. Whatever she was going to say, she stopped herself. Still, she wasn’t happy and walked away from me before sitting down in the chair with her arms crossed.

Walking back over to the group, Ice looked at me with nothing but. anger. “A sshole.” She whispered.

“Okay. Go sit down.” I said. If the pregnant women were going to be mad at me, they can do it from a chair. Ice huffed and sat down.

beside Penny.

“I’ve never seen them so mad before.” Jacob nodded his head as he watched them glare at me.

“Thanks for the support.” I muttered as I watched a crying Cassie come up and sit down on the other side of Penny. Penny was obviously not exactly happy but she wasn’t upset either.

Eventually, everyone was surrounding us and no one was speaking. Some people were glaring at Zac and Gunther but looked confused at Kara. I knew what I was about to do and I did feel s hitting but they were going to find out eventually.



















###Chapter 405

Walking up to the front, I cleared my throat and started speaking. “I appreciate everyone dropping what they were doing to rush over here. Since the Black Moon pack is like an extension of the Blue Fang Pack, I felt it was required for everyone to witness this. Now, what your might not know is there is a new threat to our packs.” There was a loud gasp at this.

“What?” Someone called out.

“Who?” Another person yelled before I held up my hand.

“While we were focused on Rip and Darin, Vin and Gunther here managed to escape. Vin has decided to pick up on a side business. that Darin had started. However, he lost his buyers and now wants Luna Penny as proof that he has what it takes to run the business.” There was a collective gasp around the crowd.

“However, we have been collecting evidence and different things which brings me to today.”

Walking over to the three, I started with Zac. “This is Zac. As you all aware of, he is Luna Penny’s biological father. He is being charg with playing both sides. No only has he killed but he has lied to m and caused more harm for your Luna than good. He is formally being charged with treason and I find him guilty. He will be sentence to death by lethal injection.”

Cassie was really crying at this and Penny was glaring at me hard.” KILL HIM!” I heard someone yell out.

Ignoring them, I pushed Zac back and grabbed Gunther. “This is Gunther. We managed to capture him. He is being charged with crimes against Luna Penny and Luna Kristen. He played a part in Luna Kristen’s abductions and is responsible for multiple killings. You

back.

“Finally, as you are all aware of. This is Kara.” Grabbing her arm, I pulled her forward. She was face downward at the ground. Grabbing her hair, I forced her to look at everyone. “Kara is the true mate of

Gunther and has been helping him by breaking into my office and stealing important documentation. She is charged with treason and is sentence to death by lethal injection.” Kara’s body was sobbing and shaking as I pushed her back. Gunther’s body twitched like he wanted

to hold her but decided not to.

“Alpha.” The doctor came up to me and presented me with three

syringes.

“Purple correct?” I asked under my breath.

“Yes, Alpha. I checked it myself.” He said before walking back.

“Any last words before I inject you with extreme prejudice?” I asked.

Zac and Gunther held their head high and shook their heads no. Kara was barely standing from her shaking legs. However, she didn’t. verbally respond so I just ignored her. Looking Zac in the eyes, I we had an understanding. So when I pushed the needle into his shoulder, I didn’t feel bad at all. His eyes instantly rolled back and fell forward… dead.

Setting that syringe down, I picked up the next one and looked at noveldrama

Gunther. He, too, nodded at me so I stuck him in the arm. A second

later, his eyes rolled back and he fell to the ground… dead.

“Please! NO!” Kara cried but the guards held her in place. “I am so sorry.” S not was rolling down her face as she pleaded. Grabbing the syringe, I felt like the biggest piece of s hit in the world but I still stuck her in the arm. She was fighting so much that a guard had to hold her still. Just like the other two, she fell face first in the ground… dead.

Cassie had been hysterically crying but was started to calm down as she looked at Zac and back at me. “Thank you all again for coming. Please return to your daily lives. We are still addressing the issues. with Vin. Safety measures should be taken but no alarm should be sounded. Right now, live your lives but carefully.”

















###Chapter 406

Everyone started walking away without too much commotion. “B-but he isn’-”

“Don’t f ucking say a word.” I got in Cassie’s face and used my command as quietly as possible.

Her eyes got wide as she looked at me and took a step back. “Colt?” Penny looked at me confused.

“Take Cassie to our office. You guys stay there and Alec and I will be right back. Jasper and Jacob.. you are in charge.” I said and looked around. “Warriors!” Install, I was surrounded by men, ready to go.

“Alpha!” They said in unison.

“Don’t ask questions but follow my lead. Don’t shoot until instructed.” I commanded.

“Yes, Alpha!” I heard from around. noveldrama

“Get their bodies and gently place in the back of a truck and prepare to ride.” Thankfully, no one questioned me as this is not what we do normally with dead bodies.

Within minutes, we were piled in a vehicle and driving down the road. No one spoke and I didn’t want to say anything in front of my warriors. This needed to go off according to my plan. The dangerous part was still to come but I didn’t know what else to do.

“STOP!” I yelled. Pulling out three separate syringes, I got out and walked up to the bodies. This was a tracker. Inserting this into their bodies should help me locate them but I had to inject it into a place. that wasn’t noticeable. Like, inside their mouth and under their tongue. Unless they palpated it, no one would ever know.


“Okay, let’s go.” I said as I got back in. Only Alec and I knew about the trackers and I intended on keeping it that way.

After another thirty minutes of driving, Alec told the warrior to slow down. “This is the place.” He whispered.

“You sure?” Looking around, I tried to find the little cabin Gunther told

us about.

“Right there.” Alec pointed ahead, between the trees.

“Okay.” I said as the truck got put into part. “Warriors, stay here but keep an eye out.”

“But Alpha… wha-”

“What did I just say?” I looked at him with black anger filled eyes.

“Yes, Alpha.” He bowed and took a few steps back as Alec and I grabbed the three bodies. Dead weight was so much heavier than live bodies and I was feeling all of Zac and Kara.

Slowly, we walked up to the house. Even though we half expected some traps set up, we kept walking like we had a purpose. As so I saw the camera turn towards us, I knew we were being wat

“Vin, I brought you a present. I don’t deal with traders and since seem to be on your side, I brought you a present.” We both toss down their bodies. The camera followed their lifeless bodies and

came back up to us. “Next body I carry will be yours.” I promised as

we turned and walked back to the truck.

“Any signs of life?” Alec asked quietly.

“No Alpha.”

“Good, let’s roll!” I yelled as we piled in and drove back to the

packhouse. The drive was just as silent as the drive there. “Warriors, I am commanding each one of you to keep your f ucking mouth shut

understood?”

“Yes, Alpha.” They all said before walking off.

“Now the hard part.” Alec groaned as we walked up the steps and into the pack house. As soon as I opened the office door, I was pounded with questions.

“Why is Cassie telling me that her mate bond with Zac is still present? Did you not kill him?” Penny still had so much anger in her face that I was starting to second guess myself.

###Chapter 407

“Can I sit down first?” I asked as I walked past her. Kristen, Penny and Cassie were all looking at me, glaring as I walked over to my desk. Alec walked silently behind me. Loading up my computer, I was able to get the app that will track their movements.

“Colt!” Penny stomped her foot at me.

“Penny, have I not asked you multiple times to trust me and bet patient? I need to finish this and then I will explain.” It was starting to get upset with how little patience she was showing me with this. Did she really have that little faith in me that she couldn’t wait and see?

Turning back to the computer, I clicked the three separate trackers and flipped them on. Instantly, their vitals showed up as well as their locations. Not only did I have a spot on the map of their locations but I got the map coordinates of their positioning so if the map goes out, noveldrama

I still know where they are.

“They’ve waken up.” Alec muttered as he pointed to the heart bea

“I thought that would take longer. We barely had enough time.” I wa a little surprised by this.

“Maybe the dose didn’t count for their body weights?” Alec guessed.

“Kara is awake.” Pointing out her tracker. The only reason I knew it was her was because her blood pressure wasn’t near as high as the

men’s.

“They are on the move.” Alec said after a moment. Right on cue, all three of them were walking in a different direction. More south but they walked together.


“Someone needs to be monitoring this at all times.”

“For what, exactly?” Alec asked as he put his hands on his hips.

“Their vitals. That way, if something sp ikes, we can get into position.” I didn’t want to leave them completely unprotected.

“We can’t intervene. That ruins the entire plan.” Alec shook his head.

“I know but that is a lot of trust out there.” I kept second guessing myself.

“Well, time to fill everyone in here in.” Alec said as he reached down and pressed the lock button. The entire room went into shutdown mode Windows were covered with a bullet proof metal shielding and the door had metal blocks shot out, making it so you can’t open the door or shoot through it.

“It is that serious?” Ice asked.

“For this plan to work, yes.” I said as I looked at them all. The three girls were standing in front of me and Jasper and Jacob were off to either side, looking somewhat bored.

“I’ll give Colt all the credit for this plan.” Alec said and sat down in a

random chair behind me.

“Thanks.” I said as I rolled my eyes.

“I know Zac is still alive.” Cassie said, quietly.


“Correct. They are all still alive. I faked their death in order to put them back on Vin’s radar. Hopefully with some luck, they will be able to either fly under the radar or worm their way into his circle again.”

“I don’t understand…” Penny looked confused.

“As much as I hate Zac and his methods, he hasn’t actually done. anything to hurt us. Now, it didn’t exactly work out in our favor, nor was it what I wanted to happen but his methods are his own. He hasn’t crossed a line that can’t be forgiven. Still, he is not a man that

min on quicly via onun and mater

the streets. It is what he knows and it is what he is good at.”

“You gave him another chance.” Cassie said as she looked at me.

“Correct. I saved him from getting killed by Vin. I gave them a poison that makes the heart beat so slow that it appears they died. After some time, their heart goes back to normal. Taking their bodies, I dropped them off at a known hideout for Vin. According to Gunther anyway. I dumped their bodies in hopes that Vin would see I killed them but when they lived, they are suppose to convince Vin that I made an error and didn’t poison them correctly.”

“They knew about this?” Penny asked.

“100%. It was my idea but Zac and Gunther jumped on it. Kara… well she made her bed and now she can lie in it. Besides, I can’t kill the guys and not hold her accountable for her actions as well. I needed to

sell it.”

“They were never in danger of dying.” Penny concluded.

“Actually, they are more at risk for dying. I am leaving it up to them to decide how they want to proceed.

They can stay in the shadows or walk up to him. The deal was, bri me Vin, dead or alive. If they can give me some information on him o hand deliver his head, all their actions in the past will be forgiven. I’ll allow Gunther to live and make him part of our pack. With stipulations of course but he will get to live. Zac, again, will get to live and know his daughter is safe. Kara will be forgiven.”

“She only did what she did because of the mate bond.” Ice said.

“Yeah. I assume she was thinking of ways to save him and she made poor decisions but she did try to warn us with that note. Either way, she still committed treason so if she is successful, she can come back to the pack.” I said firmly.















###Chapter 408

“Did she want to do this?” Penny asked.

“Not really but she didn’t have much of a choice. She wanted to clear her name so this was her task.” I had very little emotion in my voice. when talking about her. She was just another pack member.

“What if they get killed?” Penny asked.

“Gunther was going to get killed by my hand or Vin’s. At least this way he will have a chance at a life. Kara, well she was looking at a life of either banishment or jail. Regardless of her reasons, she still decided to help Vin. What would have happened if we didn’t leave fake information for her to give him? She would have possibly taken something very serious and costed many lives. That isn’t something you just slap on the wrist. As much as I sympathize with her situation, she could have walked up to me and told me it all. Instead,

she went behind my back.”

“And Zac?” Cassie asked.

“Zac was pis sed he was caught. I know you both are mated but domestic life isn’t for him. He was eager to get back out there and what he could to save Penny. Again, I absolutely hate his method. but as long as it keeps Penny safe, I am going to turn a blind eye… or until he crosses a line.” I was talking more to Cassie anyone else.

“Why were you so against it?” Ice asked Alec. noveldrama

“We let Gunther walk. He could go back to his ways extremely easily. We literally let him go. After all his crimes, he could easily say, f uck you and betray his word. His word doesn’t even mean s hit to begin with. I wanted to kill Gunther, banish Kara and let Zac go back out there.”

“Is there not a way to forgive Kara?” Penny asked. “Surely she could go through some punishment and then be forgiven.”

“Penny, she literally only asked you for a job so she could get close to you. She wanted a job in the buildings you built to use as an entry point for Vin. Everything she has done in the last month or so has been calculated by Gunther. She had a choice. Come talk to me and work with me to fix the issue or go behind our backs and commit treason. If she wasn’t caught, she could have been one of the girls that were sent to kill you at the luna ceremony. Did you think of that? She would have killed you if it meant saving Gunther. If Vin held a knife to Gunther’s throat, I would bet anything should would have spilled your blood to save his.”

“I’m actually going to back Colt up on this. Kara’s focus was Gunther, not how it affected the pack. It still is on Gunther. Call it the mate bond and it probably is, but you still have free will.” Alec chimed in.

“Anyone would do anything to save their mate.” Penny said

stubbornly.

“Would you die and let our babies die if it mean allowing Gunther to live?” I asked her. She looked at me and blinked a few times. “We lay down our lives for our pack willingly. However, at the end of the day, we do what is in the best interest of the pack. The pack comes first and you are carrying the heirs to the pack. What happens if we die? Your life is much greater than Gunther’s. Why do you think Vin is desperately trying to get you?” I said it in a calm voice but there was still an edge to it.

Penny put her hand over her belly and sat down. “I know it sucks but he is right. The whole situation sucks and I know you feel guilty but this might be a blessing in disguise. Even if Colt allowed Kara to stay in the pack, no one would be friends with her. No one would talk to her. She would probably get bullied and treated like c rap. Their loyalty

laid a hand on Penny’s shoulder.

“We could have found her another pack…”

“How? Call someone up and be like, can you take this pack member of mine that I am banishing for treason?” Ice said sarcastically.” Would you accept someone into your pack if their Alpha called you up and said that to you?”

“Well, no…” Penny sighed and looked at me. “This whole situation sucks.”

agree but there wasn’t much option. My choices were limited so I took a risk. It may come back and bite me in the as s or it may be the best decision that I ever made.”

“So, we can’t tell anyone outside this room.” Jacob spoke up for the

first time.

“Correct. Less people who know about this the better.”

“Do they know they are being tracked?” Penny asked.

“No. I didn’t tell him I was going to do that. They think they are walking around without my knowledge of their location.”

“Da mn, that’s crazy.” Jasper said as he started pacing.

“I don’t want to leave them completely unprotected. I do have someone helping me out but we will be doing our own recon to make sure things are working in our favor.” I said.

“So, you will help them live?” Penny asked me.
















###Chapter 409

“I’ll do anything within reason to make sure they live. I gave them a choice. Everyone, including Kara agreed to it. I didn’t force them. They chose this in their own free will. I won’t lie and say this didn’t work out in my favor but there isn’t much negative outcome for me.”

“If Zac does, I die.” Cassie clarified.

“Zac isn’t in anymore danger than he was yesterday. I just allowed him to keep doing things his way. Not that I agree with his way but regardless.”

“You can hate this but this is our reality. Our options weren’t great. You girls can keep arguing but that isn’t going to change it. If you look at it objectively, this was the best option.” Alec put his hands on the desk. He was done listening to the arguing.

“Since we were not part of the decision making, I believe I have every right to be included. I am an Alpha after all.” Penny said.

“Then act like it.” Alec narrowed his eyes at Penny.

“Okay. I think it’s time for us to go.” Ice said and stepped between us. “Fighting each other isn’t a good idea. Emotions are high and I think. we need to take a break.” Ice walked over and took Alec by the arm. Unlocking the office, Alec, Ice and Jasper all headed to their car.

“Cassie, please give us some privacy.” I said and looked at her.

“Yes, Alpha.” She out her hand on Penny and walked out. Jacob closed the door behind him.

“I should have been included. You had no right to decide that without

me.”

“You haven’t wanted to act like an Alpha! Did you not ask me to keep

3000

IL MUTIL LU NITUN

and this wasn’t directly about you.”I could feel myself getting angry.

“I came back and said I wanted to know!” Penny put her hands on her

hips.

“You can’t do this. You either need to be fully involved or you need to trust that I can make decisions that will benefit the pack. Just because you disagree with this decision doesn’t mean you get to start questioning my ability to do this job.” My hands slammed on my desk as I stood up.

“Okay…” Jacob stepped in. “Colt, let’s go for a walk.” noveldrama

Jacob was right. We needed some space. Walking right past Penny, out the office door and into the world around me.

“F uck!” I growled as my feet stomped down the steps of the porch.

“Over here.” Jacob pulled me to the gazebo in the middle of the garden.

“Why?”

“We need to talk.” Jacob said, firmly

“I don’t want to talk about Penny.” I said stubbornly as I watched

Jacob sit on the bench.

“I don’t either.” He shrugged and nodded towards the bench in fron

of him.

“Then what?” I asked but didn’t move to the bench.

“Sherry.”

“What about her?” Sighing, I sat down on the bench and leaned back. My arms were draped over the back, waiting to hear his decision.

“I think I’m ready to move on.”

“Okay.” I said and shrugged. I knew he would, just a matter of time.

“Only because I don’t really have another option. I can’t believe she was

mates to him but I knew she had a past and it was hard. I really want to know what has become to Tanya.”

“Nothing. She is still in the cells at Alec’s pack.”

“Sherry wants to confront her. The final straw to out the past behind her.” Jacob more told than asked.

“You think that’s a good idea?”

“I don’t see how it could get worse. Nothing is good about this but. maybe it will allow Sherry to heal. Seeing her really brought up negative emotions and she is back to not wanting to be touched.”

“What are you wanting from me?” I asked, unsure of what he was really asking. “we both know you didn’t need to ask this.”

“I… I don’t feel Sherry should be in position of power here.” Jacob jumped up and started pacing. “There, I said it.” He tossed his arms up in frustration.








###Chapter 410

“Oh.” I wasn’t sure what to say. I guess there isn’t a rule that said she can’t not be Beta female. I’m sure Penny could find someone to do it. Finding the right person is difficult.

“I’m sorry but with the conversations we have had, she has too much trauma that she needs to work through. Maybe one day she will be trusted with that position but right now, she needs to focus on getting

better.”

“Okay.” I said simply.

“Okay?” Jacob looked at me like he expected something more.

“Jacob, making a decision for the benefit of the pack isn’t easy. Especially when it comes to your mate. Your acting like a true beta. If Sherry needs help then move mountains and get her help. We will get by till she is available.”

“Thanks. I thought you would be upset.”

“Why? She needs help. I can’t imagine the terror she lived throu The first step of healing is accepting what was. Now, she knows y are on her side, she will have your support as she makes it.”

“Okay. Can she leave the room?”


“We need to talk to her again first.” I said. Jacob nodded but didn’t say anything else.

Saya noveldrama

“Can we do that now?” Jacob finally asked.

“Sure.” I had calmed down enough that I could do it. Standing up, we walked back to the pack house.

“I’ll get her and meet you in your office.” Jacob said.

“Okay.” I went to my office as he walked off to his room. Going inside, I saw Penny sitting at her desk. “Jacob is bringing Sherry in to talk.

She is going to get therapy and get better before returning to her duties.” Sitting behind my desk, I loaded up my computer.

“Do you want me to leave?” Penny asked.

“You are free to do whatever you want to do.” Looking at the trackers,

I saw they had split up. On my phone, there was a message.

Unknown: Gunther is back with Vin.


There was also a missed call from him that I needed to return. However, Jacob would be here soon so I didn’t have time to make

that call.

“I’ll stay.” Penny walked over and took a seat in the chair in front of me. Neither one of us spoke. The silent got almost too loud when a knock on the door made us both sigh in relief.

“A-alpha.” Sherry bowed as she came in.

“Sherry, come in and have a seat.” I said.

She was pretty timid as she made her way in and had a seat. you for seeing me.”

“Of course. What can I do for you?”

“I wanted to apologize for not telling you the full truth. I was afraid of how everyone would react.”

“Do you have anything else you want to tell me?” I asked.

“I just don’t know. I would like to confess everything to Jacob privately. He obviously will be able to tell you anything that needs relayed. If it’s okay with you, I’d like to keep between him and I. I think I’ll find it easier to face my past if I do it this way.”

“I’ll respect that as long as you understand that Jacob has a responsibility to tell me anything that will affect the security of this pack and of the Luna. I don’t want that to keep you from opening up to Jacob. I’m glad you are seeking help and I’m proud of you for it. However, in the mean time, I think you need to take a break from beta female duties. Take time and heal yourself and we can look into you doing more at a later date.”

I

“I understand that. I’m sorry it has come to this. I knew I should have. said something sooner.”

“Understand that I am granting you this freedom because Jacob is your mate. Don’t make me regret this but I want you to get better.” “I understand. Thank you.” Sherry stood up. “One more thing….”


















###Chapter 411

“What is it?” I asked, a little nervous.

“Darin used to mark his… girls. They will have a rose tattoo on their shoulder blade if they were part of what it was he was doing.”

Jacob looked down at his feet and shifted uncomfortably. I’ve seen a few of those tattoos around but didn’t think much of it. “Thank you for telling me.” I said finally.

Sherry nodded and her and Jacob walked out of our office. “What happens now?” Penny asked.

“Not really sure. Continue to monitor their location and probably do some of my own recon. We have your luna ceremony Saturday. We really need to lay low until we have some evidence of an attack or a situation.”

“Do you think it is wise to still do a luna ceremony after what happened at Kris’s?”

“We are more prepared this time.”

“I thought you were prepared last time.” Penny narrowed her eyes at

me.

“Its’s under control.” I said and looked back at the tracking decide.

Kara POV

“Kara, wake up!” Gunther was shaking me. The more I tried to ignore. him, the harder he shook. “KARA!” He whispered urgently.

“What?” I tried to forget where I even was. The last 24 hours have been something of my nightmares. The fear of being injected with something that could not just pretend to kill me but actually kill me

mspluvi

Now, I am in this abandoned shack. There is no blankets or anything. There was more holes in the walls than actual wood and it gets cold at night.

“They are here!” Gunther jumped out of the stained mattress and started pacing.

“They? As in Vin?” Lifting my head up, my frizzy hair got in the way of seeing him. noveldrama

“Yes! Get up!” He whispered more urgently. Everything in my body. protested as I got up and straighten my clothes as much as possible.

“Where are they?” I whispered as Gunther looking in a few different


directions.

“Everywhere.” He said quietly. A cold chill fell over me. “Come on.” Gunther walked to the door and opened it. As soon as he did, I saw multiple men emerging from the trees. The sun was still rising so there was enough shadowing that I wasn’t sure how many where.

there.

“Gunther. How… surprising to see you. I watched your execution.” Vin stood in front of the yard with his hands folded in front of him.

“I’m just as surprised as you are.” Gunther walked out and I moved to the front door.

“I see your mate made it as well.” Vin narrowed his eyes at me.

“He used the same poison. Obviously he didn’t use the correct dose.” Gunther crossed his arms over his chest.

“So, I take it you are ready to come back into our ranks?” Vin asked. More and more men emerged from the trees.

“It is. We are wanting to stay in the shadows and help. Colt believes we are dead so we can use that to our advantage.”

“Well….” Thunder rolled in the distance. “Let’s move this conversation back to my home and we can discuss this further. Follow me.” Vin turned and started walking. Everything in my body told me not to follow him but Gunther walked up to me, took my arm and pulled me with me.

We walked for what felt like hours. The rain started to pour just within thirty minutes of our walk. No one spoke or moved out of formation. More than once, I turned to look at who was around me but Gunther kept making me look straight.

If it wasn’t for Gunther holding onto me, I would have eat so much dirt that it wouldn’t have been funny. Still, my ankle was starting to really throb. It was only when the grey sky started getting darker that I was just about at my limit when Vin suddenly spoke.

“Home sweet home.” He sang and raised his arms. This building in front of me was like a f ucking castle. Pack houses are generally very large but this was a whole new level. Everything was either black or covered in dirt. The vines were covering most of the castle but the dark windows the most unnerving part of the whole thing.















###Chapter 412

“Stop.” The guard walked out in front of us and started patting Gunther down.

“Strip.” A guard walked up to me.

“W-what?” I looked at Gunther in fright.

“It’s customary for everyone to get searched for anything before they come onto my territory. Can’t have any traitors now.” Vin looked like he was having fun.

“She doesn’t have anything on her.” Gunther said through gritted

teeth.

“We shall see. Strip.” Vin said and dangerously.


“B-but…” Grabbing my shirt, I took a step back. My heart was beating. rapidly. A guard stepped behind me and pointed a gun at my head.

“Either strip or I will help you.” He said with an evil smile.

Taking a few steps from him, my shaking hands pulled my shirt up and over my head. I didn’t have the biggest rack but I had a decent amount. All the guards started snickering at my expense.

“The shorts.” Vin said firmly.

It took me a few times to unbutton my shorts and push them down from how bad I was shaking. A silent tear ran down my face from embarrassment. “Very nice. You got a good one Gunther. We used to share in the past.” A guard walked up to me and ran his finger down my back.

“No.” Gunther said and walked up to me. Yanking me away from him, he picked up my shirt and pushed it in my arms. “Get dressed.” He

“Come. We need to get ready for a feast. My brother is back and found his mate.” Vin said as he narrowed his eyes at me.

Dressing as we walked, I was so sickened that I had to force myself to not throw up. The inside of the castle is exactly what you would picture when thinking of a man decorated castle. Gold covered every surface, velvet lined the stairs, statues of gargoyles had eyes that followed you everywhere and even the antique pictures seemed angry. noveldrama

Vin marched us up the stairs and down a dimly lit hallway until he stopped abruptly. “This is your room. I have taken the opportunity of laying our the evening clothes for you both. Dinner is served in one hour in the grand dinning room. Don’t be late. We have much to discuss.” Vin gave Gunther a look before walking away.


Gunther opened the door, ‘shoved me in before closing it and locking it. “He doesn’t trust me.” Gunther said out loud. In the mind-link, ” Don’t say anything out loud that is private. He will have cameras and audio in this room.”

“Seriously?” I said in the mind-link as I walked over to the bed.

“Yes, speak out loud but be careful what you say.” Gunther took his shirt off and tossed it in a basket.

“I have to wear this dress?” It was a blood red dress with an extremely low V-shaped top with a very high slit in the fluffy shirt.

“Yes. You need to shower and get ready.” Gunther said in a very annoyed tone. He wasn’t exactly annoyed at me but he wasn’t loving

either.

“I don’t ha-” As soon as I walked into the bathroom, there was an array of female product for me to use to get ready. There was a little of everything on the counter. Gunther turned the water on and it was only seconds before the steam started seeping out of the top.

“It needs to be hot so the steam will fog the camera “Gunther said in the mind-link “Come stand in front of me and get undressed and get

it”

Doing as he said, I got in front of him and slipped out of my clothes and got in the boiling water. It was actually very comforting. The hot water felt nice but it was burning off all the stares I was had gotten. wasn’t a warrior so my body wasn’t tone but I didn’t have any extra fat

either

My skin was red before I grabbed the shampoo and Gunther joined me. Never had I ever shared a shower before so I was taken off guard. Gunther smirked as he noticed my surprise











###Chapter 413

“Never showered with anyone before?” He asked.

“No.” I said quietly.

“Me either.” He whispered and shifted me so he was under the water. My eyes couldn’t help but graze his body was he back was turned towards me. As I shampooed my hair, I couldn’t help but think about how se xy he was.

“You’re going to have to wait till tonight. We are in too big of a rush for me to f uck you in the shower but don’t worry. When this is all said and done, I’ll f uck you any place you want.” Gunther whispered to me and turned me so I was back under the water.

“You have to make sure we live through this, first.” I reminded him as I finished washing my hair.

“I promise I’ll do everything in my power to get us out of this.” Gunther said in the mind-link. He held up a finger to his mouth to remind me to chose my words carefully.


“I’m finished.” I said as the last of the soap ran down the drain.

Gunther shut off the water and opened the door just a little to grab the towels. After handing me one, he took one and stepped out. I

dried myself off in the shower before stepping out.

“Is there any panties or bras?” I asked.

“No. Vin doesn’t believe in them.” Gunther sighed. Tightening the towel, I pulled out a blow dryer and brush and got to work. Gunther stepped out of the bathroom as I did my hair and then moved on to my

makeup. Not wanting to look extremely good, I kept my makeup. light. Wanting to cover as much skin as possible, I left my hair down noveldrama

“We need to live in five minutes.” Gunther called from the bedroom.


“Okay.” I said as I stepped out from the bathroom. Walking over to the bed, I grabbed the dress and kept my towel. Stepping into the dress, I pulled it up and under my towel until the towel fell to the ground. Slipping my arms in the holes, Gunther came around and zipped me up. The dress really fit my like a glove. The shoulders were hanging down and my boobs were out on display. Normally, I would feel very se xy in this dress but right now, I felt exposed and dirty.

“Here are shoes.” Gunther pulled out some black heels.

“How did he know my size?” I asked.

“He probably knows everything about you. Vin makes it his mission to know a person before they are allowed in his circle. In fact, he probably knows more about your family tree than you do.” Gunther finished buckling my shoe before looking at his watch.

“Time to go.” I said as I took his arm that he offered.

“S”Speak only when spoke to and keep it short. Don’t give them rereason to be angry with you. He already knows everything eveven try to lie.” Gunther said in the mind-link as he shut the dedoor and we walked down the hall.

Hele was wearing a black pin stripped tux with a red tie. It was very mmatchy matchy to the point that I almost forgot this wasn’t a pron Yorou took good.” I said out loud.

GtGunther did a double take at me before smirking a little. “Thank you,

polo took beautiful too.”

“Whyhy red?” Lasked,

“Calotarial blood and I do love to spill blood.” Vin said from behind us.















###Chapter 414

“You got the perfect size.” I said, trying to fake confidence.

“I see that. You look delicious.” Vin grabbed my arm and made me do a twirl.

“What have you decided on dinner?” Gunther asked as he took my other hand and pulled me against him. The sparks was something that I loved feeling. More than once, I accidentally moaned out loud just from him touching my arm. In this currently situation, they were only comforting.

“Roasted duck with asparagus and mashed potatoes.” Vin started walking and Gunther instantly started following him.

“One of your favorites.” Gunther fake chuckled at him, or at least I thought it was a fake laugh. It almost sounded real. Like he found some humor in it.

“As I remember, it was once your favorite too.” Vin smirked at Gunther. “You ate it off that wh ore’s stomach.”

My stomach turned as Gunther tossed his head back and laug She got very nervous when I started using a knife.”

“Good times.” Vin said as we approached the dinning room. There was already men seated with a women beside each one. They all looked scared as they kept their heads pointed downward.

All the men’s eyes watched us as we walked up to the head table and sat down. Gunther pulled my chair out for me and pushed it in before sitting down himself. “Gentleman Gunther. Who knew.” A man said as he picked up his glass of wine and took a sip.

“Any kind of man knows how to be respectful. Not everyone was

பப

now. Following the other women’s lead, I just kept my head down and didn’t make any movements.

“Dinner is served.” Vin clapped his hands and the side doors instantly opened. Women in skimpy uniforms walked out with plates. One by one, they were set in front of us. I made the mistake of looking up as one of the guys grabbed a fist full of as s as one passed. She didn’t. even flinch but I saw the pain in her eyes.

To Gunther’s credit, he was rather disgusted in that display. “I see you got new meat.”

“Yes, we came into some good investments. They are proving to be more difficult to train but what else do you expect from them… they are only women after all.” Vin waved them off as he picked up his fork and took the first bite. Everyone else followed and started eating. Even the women so I took my fork and knife to cut the duck.

“This is so good!” A man said from across from me with a mouth full


of food.

“MANNERS!” Vin slammed his fist down on the table, making women jump, including me. I knew Vin had an evil side but the his eyes truly terrified me. So much that my hands shook as I tri keep eating.

I’m sure at the right setting, this would be great food. However, it all tasted like sawdust in my mouth. Even my saliva ran away, forcing me to drink the wine rather quickly.

“Gunther, now that you are back, I have a job for you.” Vin said after a

few minutes of silence.

“A job? You are going to give him a job?” The guy with poor manners spoke up again.

Vin looked at him. “Are you questioning me?” His eye brow raised and

TIC LOOK Ú DI vi uspuruyuʊ.

“No, Vin. Never. I am just willing to do any job that you require.” He bowed his head in submission.

“I don’t require anything from a man that can’t keep it in his pants. I need this job done correctly and not distracted by t its.” Vin waved the guy off. “Gunther. Come to my office after dinner to discuss your job.” noveldrama

“With pleasure.” Gunther said it as he looked directly at the guy who. was whining.

“Ms. Kara. I understand you are the ex-girlfriend of Alpha Colt of the Blue Fang Pack.” It was a statement, not a question.












###Chapter 415

“Correct, sir.” I said as I cleared my throat. The wine was starting to get to me. My lips were tingling, my face was flushed and my body.

was relaxing.

“Tell me, why didn’t he make you luna?” Vin asked.

“I wasn’t his mate, sir. On his birthday, it was clear we weren’t mates

so we were officially broken up.”

“However, he wasn’t your first boyfriend.”

My body froze as his words sank in. “He was my only boyfriend.”

“What about a Mr. Russell Bount?” Vin finished off his mashed

potatoes and used his cloth napkin to clean his mouth.

“We went on a few dates but that was it. He wasn’t classified as my

boyfriend.”


“But you lost your virginity to him.”

I felt Gunther stiffen up at this. He knew I wasn’t a virgin but I didn’t correct him when he assumed Colt was the only person I slept with. I found the whole thing st upid as he slept around a lot.

Since Gunther told me not to lie, I didn’t. “In the back seat of a

Corvette.”

A few men snickered. “I have a gift for you.” Vin said in a way that made me look up at him. Up until now, I kept avoiding his eye

contact.

“A gift?” Gunther said.

“Yes, come see.” Vin stood up and everyone followed.

Gunther helped me to my feet and then followed Vin out of the dinning room and down the hall. We kept going until a backdoor came into view. As soon as we walked outside, I was immediately. sick to my stomach. Russell was tied to a tree. Not around the tree but his arms and legs were stretched as far out as possible with rope connecting him to a tree. His body was suspended in the air so he was a huge X.

“I assume you recognize him.” Vin said. I had stopped walking as all the emotions ran through me.

“Yes.”

“Gunther, what you don’t know is that Russell here was Kara’s first

Jove. Not Colt but Russell.”


“Where…” I couldn’t stop myself from speaking.

“Where did I find him?” Vin filled in for me. “I assumed I would run

into you again so I took the liberty to test your loyalty.”

“Test my loyalty?” I asked, hoping I heard him wrong.

“Correct.” Vin took my arm and yanked me down the yard an by a wooden table. “Prove you are loyal to me. Kill him. Cho weapon and take him out.” Vin made it sound like it was easy as

that. noveldrama

“Pick up the gun and just do it.” Gunther said in the mind-link.

“I’ve never killed before.” I whispered back. “I don’t think I can.” Tears

threatened to fall.

“You don’t have a choice.” Gunther growled. “I am commanding your to pick up the gun and kil him.”

Me ntally, I knew he couldn’t command me to do s hit but my arms didn’t listen. “NO! PLEASE!” Russell begged.

*E BONUS

I wasn’t sure what gun I grabbed but with two hands, I pointed it at Russell and fired. The first shot missed him completely. By this time, tears were running down my face as I squeezed the trigger again. This time I hit his leg. Russell cried out in pain as I pulled the trigger again. That one nicked his side.

At this time, I just stopped paying attention and pulled the trigger until nothing else came out. Russell was still crying out as I opened my eyes to the horror scene in front of me. All my shots hit none vital parts except one. That his artery in his leg. Blood was flowing out of him painfully slow.

“That isn’t exactly what I had pictured but he will die.” Vin said, almost impressed. “You couldn’t have walked closer.”

Realization of what I just did hit me as Russell closed his eyes and became quiet. I just killed a man. “I didn’t think she would have it in her.” The guys joked behind me.


















###Chapter 416

My feet wanted to run. Would Colt take me back after his? Would he allow us to be part of his pack again or did I just seal our fate? “You did what you had to.” Gunther said in the mind-link. It was like he read my mind.

“I shouldn’t have had to.” I said avoiding looking at Russell’s body.

“No.” Gunther agreed.

“I think it is time for the men to retire to the study for a drink and then Gunther and I have a meeting.” Vin said and walked back inside.

“Come on.” Gunther said out loud to me. He walked me back inside. and up to our bedroom. Neither one of us spoke until we got there.

“Do I have anything to sleep in?” I asked.

“No. We have to sleep naked.”

“Can I sleep in your shirt?” I asked as Gunther was pulling on he.

“Not unless you want Vin to come and correct that behavior.” G didn’t even look at me as he walked to the bathroom.

It was all I could do but sit down on the bed. “Okay.” I said in

acceptance.

“I have to go meet the guys for a drink. I’ll be back later, don’t wait up.” Gunther came up to me and kissed me on the forehead before. walking out.

Getting up, I went to lock the door but there wasn’t any. Anyone could walk in at any moment and there wasn’t anything I could do about it. Sliding under the covers, I had to wiggle around until my dress slipped off me. Tossing it on the floor, I pulled the blanket up and over my

Gunther POV

“I wondered if I was going to have to come get you.” Vin said as he pushed over a whiskey for me. Sitting down on the couch, I took it and sat back. The leather was real but cold.

“Needed to pi ss.” I said before taking a drink.

“So, what the f uck happened?” Nathaniel asked. He was the same. f ucker that wanted a job but can’t focus long enough to finish it. The only thing he can finish is on a girl.

“When all hell broke f ucking lose?” I asked, looking at him angerly.” You mean when you bailed so f ucking fast that you left everyone without protection? Why didn’t you stay and fight because I don’t recall seeing you run after Colt and Alec to get the b astard back.” Leaning forward, I set my glass down and glared at him.

“I work better in the shadows.


“You mean your a coward that can’t fight when looking at someone in the face. You only strike when their backs are turned.” Picking up my drink, I downed it before leaned back again. noveldrama

“How did Colt catch you?” Vin asked,

“I got shot. I was bleeding out. It was either taking my chances with Colt and live or die on the f ucking leaves.” Snorting, I acted like I was pis sed off. “It wasn’t like you came back for me. Even you Vin. Your left me there to die.”

“You know the rules. You were shot.” Vin acted like it was not a big deal. “What I am more concerned about is how you are still alive.”

“Yeah, exactly what happed?” Nathaniel asked, again.

“I am going to knock all your f ucking teeth out if you speak again.” I

command and that meant putting people in their place. I had a reputation for doing just that. Thankfully, Nathaniel remembered and shut up.

“When I came to, I was in the cells. They had taken the bullet out and stitched me up. Then he started questioning me.”

“What did you tell him?” Vin asked.

“Nothing he didn’t already know. He found the how you and Darin worked out of for awhile.” I shrugged.

“Maybe told him about some fun times I had.” Smirking, I refilled my glass.

###Chapter 417

“I doubt that. You don’t look like he touched you at all.” Greg, another guy in the room said. “I say you are rooting for the other team. I’m not buying it.”

“Just because your wolf isn’t capable of healing you doesn’t mean mine is weak. When have any of my injuries lasted more than 24 hours. Look at my gunshot.” Standing up, I pulled up my shirt to show them where I got shot. The bruising was gone and it was almost a

scar.

“Gunther has always had this freaky fast healing and now he has a mate.” Timothy waved me off as he poured himself a drink.

“I’m done with the pi ssing contest. Anyone want to step outside and see if you can stand against me?” Narrowing my eyes, I looked at them all. No one spoke up or even looked me in the eye.

“You boys need to get some sleep. Gunther, come to my office.” Vin stood up and walked out the study with his drink. Grabbing mine, I poured myself another glass and followed him out.

“Watch your back. Vin won’t always be here to protect you.” I heard someone whisper just as I was about out of the room. Turning back. around, my eyes landed on Greg. He wasn’t even prepared for my fist to break a few teeth but he found out pretty quickly that I didn’t lack. any strength. Even when holding some alcohol.

“Serves you right.” Another guy said but I was done listening. Walking out, I made it to Vin’s office before he sat down. noveldrama

“What took you so long?” Vin asked as I shut the door.

“Reminded Greg of his place.”

“Can’t say I blame him.” Vin looked at me and turned in his seat.



“I haven’t lied to you, you know that.” Vin had this way of just knowing when someone was lying to him. At times, it was really unnerving but mostly I found it incredibly helpful. This was not one of those times.

“True, I would know.”

“What job do you have for me?” I asked when he didn’t continue talking.

Vin pulled out a vanilla envelope and handed it to me. Taking it and opening it, my eyes landed on an average joe. Nothing was special about this man. He was average height around 5’11”, 180 lbs and had brown hair and brown eyes. If I had passed him on the street, I wouldn’t have thought about it at all. His name was Tony Garcia. No. known residency or number.

“Who’s this?” I asked after looking at the very short file.

“That is the key to Alpha Brian’s success. I assume Colt is using him

as well.”

“You mean a spy.” I said flatly.

“Call him what you want but this is the man they call to do surveillance and report back. My guess, this is how Colt has ki about part of the s hit. The other part is that f ucking c ockr oach Z Assuming he is alive too, we will need to find him and kill him. However, this man is priority.”

“How did you find him?” I asked, a little shocked but not surprised. All Alphas have someone do the dirty work for them.

“I have my ways, you know that.”

“You want him dead.” I continued.


“I want him dead but recognizable. I want to deliver him to Alpha Colt

us u prcacTTL

“Do we know where is likes to hang out?” I asked.

“There is a little hole in the wall bar about thirty minutes from the packs. Address is on the next sheet. That’s all I have but given he is. doing work around Colt’s pack and the surrounding towns, that would be a good place to start.

“Kara and I will leave tomorrow to travel back and -”

“No.” Vin interrupted.

“No?” I looked at him confused.

“Kara will stay here. Call it… insurance. You complete this job for me and I’ll believe you are back on my side. Fail, and I’ll kill Kara after I have fun with her. If you are lucky, I won’t make you watch.”

“That’s f ucking b ull s hit and you know it.” I was f ucking p issed. How dare he! After all I had done for him, this was how he was going to

treat me.

“You don’t have a choice. Either complete the task or you both die.

anytime I

Kara is not leaving here on. I suggest you find himkly.

The longer I am waiting, the more impatient I become.”

I f ucking hated Vin. This is why I wanted out. He forced people stuff for him. Never getting his own hands dirty. Hitting you whe hurts and making you put your life on the line while he sat back an downed scotch. If Colt didn’t kill him, I would. Part of me wanted to right now but I wouldn’t even make it around his desk before he would have me pinned against the wall.

“Don’t f ucking touch a hair on her head.” I spit.

“Than I suggest you put your skills to work and find him. You know

the drill. That’s why we make a great team.” Vin smiled at me.

I opened my mouth to speak but closed it as I walked out of the

office. Vin didn’t he try to stop me as I stomped up to my room to see

if Kara was sleeping or not.

that.”

“He might see us coming and just kill us before we even get to the gate.” I was getting rather annoyed with how Vin has stayed one step ahead. “Maybe Vin has his own guy. Maybe we need to go at it from the way he is going at it.”

“That’s an idea.” Alec nodded as he went into his own head.

My phone started ringing. Looking at the caller I.D, “His ears mu have been burning.” I said as I hit talk.

“C”Colt.”

“I followed Zac since he is the most wild card one. He is held up at a bbar but there is an illegal gamboling room under it. There are some major players walking in and out of there tonight. Most of them are giguys I’ve seen doing business with Alpha Rip.”

“I’m starting to think Vin has a guy. Can you find out who that guy

“Fota/pprice.”

“Considered it paid in full.” I had a bad feeling about what he was going tot cerequire of me but anything was worth Penny’s life.

“I knew ‘d’ tikike working with you.” Click!

“Has he totol you what it will cost?” Alec asked.

“I’m taking one oproblem at a time.”

Alec snorted bbore we fell into a silence that kept us bot My mind kept racining to what we would find. According to th they were both califotod the most part. Some spi kes in heart nothing that would incidicate torture or fear. Gunther was far too to allow his heart mater ectoisise but Kara does not. She has no train on torture or how to baratiele certain situations. Hopefully, Gunther ha

worked with her a atuale.

We only stopped for a drive e forough to eat, otherwise we drove the entire way. Since it was stitic claviight out, we found a sleezy hotel that

won’t ask questions and act a poroom

“We are about an hour on footfromtheir location.” Alec checked his

phone again.

“Both of them are still there?” I asked as I opened my bag.

“Yeah. We got about another two hours of daylight before the sun sets. It will take us an hour to get there. I’d say we should leave in an

hour and a half to make sure we stay under the darkness.” Alec set his phone down and put his bag on his bed.

“He surely has cameras around.”

“This will detect them.” Alec held up a little device that looked like a

miniature binocular.

“If we mess with them, they will probably get alerted. We will have to move around them.” This just got harder.

“They might even have auto so we need to be prepared for radio silence.”

“Hopefully there isn’t any thermal.” F uck, I hoped they didn’t.

“Only one way to find out.” Alec said as he started pulling more stuff

out of his bag.

Gunther POV

“Kara, wake up.” Climbing into bed, I had to gentle shake her to wake her up. However, she wasn’t moving. Part of me wanted her to sleep this one night without interruptions. When I’m gone, she probably won’t be sleeping at all. Plus, it’s been a long time since she had. actually gotten a good nights sleep.

She was so beautiful sleeping in the middle of the bed. Her hair was dull, matching our situation. As I moved it out of her face, I couldn’t help but admire her inner beauty. How the Moon Goddess hand. picked her for me, I have no idea. I wanted to be a better man for her but my hands were tied. Curling up next to her, I closed my eyes and accepted this might be my last night of good sleep for a long time.

“Are you awake?” I heard her whisper in my ear.

“No.” I felt her giggle against me. Her warm body curled around me. noveldrama

“You didn’t wake me last night when you got back.”

“I tried. You were dead to the world.” Opening my eyes, I looked at her. The room was still pitch back, telling me it was still dark. Looking. over her shoulder, the clock read 4:30am.

“What was your meeting about?” She sat up and pulled the covers

with her.

“He wants me to handle a situation.”

“When do we leave?”

“That’s the kicker, you have to stay here and I am going alone.”

“W-what?” I felt her internal fear at this.

“I’m sorry but Vin was very specific on this. You are to stay here and I will go on this job.” I wasn’t about to tell her the other stuff. No way in hell was I going to allow that to happen.









###Chapter 420

“Maybe I can c-”

“No. I’m sorry but you have to stay here. Since you are up. The earlier I leave, the better.” I went to sit up but Kara grabbed my arm.

“Gunther, please! Don’t leave me here!” The fear in her voice was

clear.

“If I had a choice, I would take you with me but I don’t. I love you Karal and I’ll do what I need to do to keep you safe.”

“Then take me with you!” Prying her hand off my arm, I stood up and got dressed some clothes from the closet. Kara followed me. Standing in the doorway, she looked at me with fear and anger. noveldrama

“I need you to be brave, Kara. You need to show no weakness here. They will test you, see if you will lie and question your loyalty. Do not lie and stay strong. You might actually be in far more danger where I am going and honestly, I can’t keep you safe and do my job. If you went, I would be worried about you and not focused on the job.”

“What am I suppose to do here?”


“Stay here unless Vin req u ir e you to go out. Take advantage of a comfortable bed a warm shower.” The way she had the sheet wrapped around herself made my di ck twitch but I didn’t have time for that. I shouldn’t have even fallen asleep beside her. Now, I am hours

behind.

“Can’t you come back to bed and leave in the daylight?” Kara asked very pathetically.

“I shouldn’t have been slept beside you. I should have left you a note and taken off.” I said honestly. Kara looked away in frustration.

pprove to Vin that I am still loyal to him.” I said out loud. In the mind- lilink, I said, “I need to do this to keep you safe from Vin. I know leaving p puts you in an uncomfortable position but if this means we can be

free, I am willing to do it. Can you please understand that?”

13 suppose.” Kara said back in the mind-link. “I don’t like it.”

“Didn’t figure you would.” I said back. Out loud, I continued like we dididn’t switch to the mind-link. “I’ll check in when I can but that

prprobably won’t be very much.”

“Okay Kara said and walked back to the bed. She climbed back in ast I tiered my shoes.

“daciain when i can.” Walking over, I kissed her forehead.

“How exactly? It’s not like we have phones.” Kara looked at me with defeatininerer eyes.

“I’ll find a way.” promised before giving her one last kiss and walked out of the cedroom. Quietly shutting the door behind me, I down the hall and did for the castle. The file was the only thing I had in my hand and with no direction, I went in the direction I was most co

The whole thing was about a thirty minute walk. The moon was still shining brightly, showing mad the path. I had walked this so much that I had worn my footprints into the forest here. It really made me smile as permanent made my mark or this planet.

Looking up at the stars, I couldidn’t help but being relaxed. If it wasn’t

Still cut off from the

life. Maybe in a completely different state but world. Part of me wanted to take Kara and do just that but I knew she wasn’t the type of girl to live that way. She needed a bed and daily hot meals.













###Chapter 0421 

So, | keep walking. A few owls and bats flew around but mostly it was quiet. Every now and then a cricket would sing but the birds will be taking over shortly.

Assingle thread of smoke in the distance told me | was just about there.

Since the bar sat on the outskirts of an abandoned town, it was easy to get to.

The town wasn’t actually abandoned but it was a hot spot for anything illegal. Darin actually put his town back in action for his sells. It was all undergrown so anyone that drove by wouldn't have a clue. Very well hidden and very well protected. The closer | got, the more security | noticed. If Ol’ Man Frank didn’t see if coming, | would be surprised. €»

The smell of something smoking was getting stronger and stronger.


Whatever he was cooking, it smelled delicious. As | got to the back of the house, the smoker was unmanned and smoke was spilling out of it.noveldrama

“The hell...” | whispered as | opened it and had to use the water bottle on a few of the flames.

CLICK! The sound of a gun being cocked was the loudest sound in the entire world. “Turn around slowly.” Frank growled. This man was short, plump but had a mean streak that would surprise Vin.

“I'm just saving your brisket.” | smirked as | turned around and faced him.

“| thought you were dead.” He didn’t lower his gun but he did lift his head

up.

“Surprise!” “What are you doing here?” “Can we go inside and I'll tell you everything?” | asked and made a point to look around. “Like you ever tell me the truth.” He grumbled as he lowered his gun and started walking inside.

“Come on, we used to be buds.” | tired to get him to at least not be so angry but | don’t think it was working.

“Kiss my ass. | haven't got any money since Rip died. Do you know what that does to a business?” He turned and pointed a

finger at me. Sliding down in a seat, | just listened to him lecture. “I had to almost empty my savings! | | should be on the beach somewhere but

no! | am stuck here, doing the dirty work for sleazeballs of all kinds!” “It’s not like | am living on the beach and have a great life.” | said honestly.

“I've been on the run and doing things for vin.” “Vin doesn’t have the fucking manners that Rip had. Sure, Rip was a bastard but he had respect for us in the working community. Vin just walks all over us like we are fucking trash. | don’t plan on helping you do shit if it is for that man.” “Yes and no. | do have a job to do but it is to help my mate.” “You found a mate?” He looked at me in shock. Frank had a big mouth so | had to be careful about what | said but | needed him to trust me, allow me to stay and maybe even get some

information out of him.

“| did, awhile ago.” “Where is she?” “Being held by Vin. | need to do a job to prove my loyalty to Vin. With Rip going down and Colt being a pain in our ass, | need to prove my worth in this world.” | knew Vin would come ass so might as well see it. @ “There are other places you can go to sleep to prove yourself worthy.” Frank rolled his eyes at me.















###Chapter 0422 

“True but none are this comfortable or have such great company.” I was sucking up hard but Frank had a soft side. His rough exterior made people think he was all business but deep down, Frank liked the company. I, truly believe that is the only reason he was still here. In this business, you don’t make friends.

“What job do you have?” Frank poured himself a coffee and sat down across from me.

“Find someone.” “Well, anyone who is anyone will be here tomorrow night for the fight.” Frank took a sip and studied me over his mug.

wy "VWs Damn, that means another night away from Kara. “Sounds like I will be hanging out the next two days.” “Good, I need help around the place.

Get down there and start sweeping.” Frank stood up and started walking away.

“Where are you going?” I yelled at him.

“Back to bed.” I watched him retreat around the corner, leaving me all lone.

“Well, shit.” Standing up, I walked back outside an into the shed. It wasn’t exactly a shed but a large roof for the stairs. From the outside, people would think this is just an everyday shed. The tin was worn down, rusted and looked like the wind could take it down at any second. However, on the inside, yearly

BR ra Sn ES treated wood lined the walls, making it possible to frame the stairs for entry.

© = It had been years since I had attended one of these events. Sometimes, they were fights, other times it was an auction. Every now and then, they would have dog fights and once I even saw a chicken fight. Basically anything that made people spend money. I've seen more women get sold here than anything. Since I was one of the guards Rip made go, I had to handle most of it.

Flipping on the lights, the fluorescent lights blinked a few times before flickering on. A single chain- linked case sat in the middle of the room. noveldrama

Blood stained the cement floor, not justin the ring but the entire place.

This room was one large circle with

built-in bars and viewing areas. There was a single exit on the other side that led to a holding cell for whatever event was going on but the only way in and out of here was the stairs. This made it impossible for anything...unwanted to g0 on. No sneaking people in or out.

Grabbing the broom, I started cleaning the floor from all the rodent droppings, dead bugs and just general debris. There was an air filtration system but that didn’t do anything for nature.

It always made me laugh that people came here for anything illegal but would throw a toddler size temper tantrum if it was a little dirty. After sweeping, there was dusting the cobwebs and putting out the tables and chairs.

Wy TY BUNUS “Isn’t this cozy.” Colt’s voice surprised the shit out of me. For the first time, I was actually afraid of the situation I found myself in.

“What are you doing here?” | asked, not looking at him but kept sweeping.

“Just following up on my investments.

I might come off as a nice guy but there is a side to me that most don’t get to see and the ones that do, don’t live to tell anyone else.” The thought of underestimating him came across my mind. “I repeat, what are you doing here? This isn’t the place someone like you would show your face.” “Just checking in. Did you really think I was going to let you live and let you go without keeping an eye on you?” Colt


ww 19 sONU was leaning against the door frame with Frank’s neck in his hands.

“What did you bring to my house?” Frank was looking at me with anger.

“Vin gave me a job and I need to prove to him my loyalty.” Narrowing my eyes at Colt, I stopped sweeping and stood my ground.

“You look like a caged animal.” Colt smirked.

“What do you want, Colt?” “What job did Vin give you?” “Buy a certain girl that he has history with.” I came up with a lie quickly.

There was no way in hell I was going to tell Colt that I was after his private informant. Kara was my top priority. If

Ifailed, she would be dead, “Not that I believe you but just know, I am always watching.” Colt drug Frank by the neck over to me and tossed him at my feet. “If I find out you betray me, I'll kill everything you care about.” Colt walked over to the stairs. “I’m always watching, Gunther. Chose your actions wisely.” Colt walked up the stairs and out the door. @ “What did you bring to my door?” Frank rubbed his neck as he stood up.

“Like I said, I have to prove my loyalty to Vin.” Sighing, I started sweeping again.

“You have found yourself in some deep shit, boy.” Frank pulled a chair out and sat down. Fingerprints were already forming on his skin.

“When haven’t I been in deep shit. My entire life has been nothing but one move away from being killed. How is this different?” “I’ve heard rumors around Blue Fang Pack. There are reasons why no one wants to attack them. Fuck, they just killed Rip and the entire pack. Is that not enough reason to stay away from them? Now they joined with Black Moon, they are basically untouchable.

Most of the guys that come here don’t want anything to do with them.” “I'm aware as I barely survived that ordeal with my own life.” Giving him a look, I kept setting up.

“Fuck, I need something stronger.” Frank growled and headed up the stairs. As soon as he was out of eyeshot, I stopped sweeping,

How the fuck did Colt find me? Has he been following me this entire time? Do I have a tracker on me? Did I just lead him to Vin’s home base? If Colt attacks Vin’s castle, he will think I intentionally led him there. Kara would be the first to die. Before Frank get's back, I started stripping, looking for injection sights that Colt might have placed a tracker when I was pretending to be dead.













###Chapter 0423 

“Do you have everything ready to go for tonight?” Fred came up behind me.

The sun was starting to set and I was just watching it. Soon, people from all over will be arriving and all I could think about was Kara. Hopefully, Vin wasn’t doing anything to hurt her.

“Yeah. The girls were brought in about an hour ago. They are in their cages and ready for the show.” | “You look like a love sick puppy.” Fred slapped my back.

“I never enjoyed these events. Too many rich pricks measuring their own dicks. Never understood why they didn’t just go and steal human girls?”

~~ “Where's the fun in that!” Fred laughed as the sound of a car approached came up from behind us.

“Show time.” Fred walked out as I went to the shed. My place tonight is in the shadows. Staying in the background, looking for my target and taking care of any drama that arrises.

The different venders were either done setting up or were putting up their final touches. Slipping against the wall, only my shoes were visible in the lightening. I dressed in all back to blend in as much as possible.

More and more people arrived, quickly filling the room with loud whispering.

Circular tables were set up along the walls with chairs but there was still quite of few men that chose to stand.

As the event was about to get started,

the lights dimmed and the soft yellow lights flickered on. Only one large white light hung above the stage where the girls will be standing.noveldrama

Since fights were prone when dealing with this kind of merchandise, we established an electronic system. Each person submitted their payment method and information when they arrived. In return, they got a key pad. If you wanted to bid, type in your amount and hit send. If your bid was first, the screen said first, or second and so forth. You can either submit a higher bid or hit cancel. Each girl was standing there for ten minutes or unless the bidding stalled.

“Does everyone have their beverage of choice and into position?” Hank was the auctioneer for these events. He was one of the worst guys I have ever met. I

didn’t really give two fucks what happened to these girls but he took it to a whole different level. I’ve seen him cut a girls throat for not walking quick enough.


He is what people would call a silver fox. Salt and pepper hair with more gel than I thought it could even hold. He wore stupidly expensive suits for being as skinny as he was. More than once, I thought of him as a stick bug.

The flights instantly went off and the center one went on. Most of the whispering stopped and all eyes were focused on the stage. The door opened and a shorter girl was brought out. She was wearing only her bra and panties, her hair was flattened with makeup.

This was Vin’s rule. If the girls looked good, they would sell better. So, a week before this event, no hitting or abuse

so their skin is clear. All the guards I recognized from Vin’s army. He’s been wanting to take over for Darinbut most of these guys are not wanting to do business with him. Like Frank said, his lack of respect is enough to push them away. @ “Her name is Stacy. She comes from the fall of Alpha Rip, where she was groomed and taught values and morals. She is ready to be submissive to her next owner.” Hank stated clearly as he tossed her into the ring. She walked nervously to the middle and just

stood there. She wouldn’t have been able to see anyone so as her eyes looked around, she was seeing only black.

My eyes scanned the room, looking for my target. At this point, there wasn’t any sign of him. Still, I kept looking at

each face of each man that was here.

Walking around, quietly, I acted as if I was just making sure no issues were around. Not looking too long but making mental notes of all I could see.

What bothered me more was the fact that Zac was sitting in the corner like he belonged here. However, if Vin was right and Tony was Colt’s private investigator, then he might just show up too. If I couldn’t find Tony, I might be able to follow Zac and find Tony that way.

Unfortunatly, Zac spotted me as I made my round but didn’t acknowledged me.

We agreed to go our own ways when we woke up but I knew it was sooner or later our worlds would connect. He was a fucking roach for everyone involved.













###Chapter 0424 

«soLD!” Hank yelled and opened the fi gate. He grabbed her and walked her back to her holding sell. When he came back out, he was dragging another girl with him. This one was another one I | recognized from my old pack and as one of Darin’s whores. She was a fighter and fought Hank the entire time. At the end, he backhanded her and tossed her into the ring before slamming the gate closed before she could jump up.

«Remember! All purchases can be picked up once they are paid for at the end.” Hank was trying to calm himself.

“Next girl is Nicki, same pack but much more of an attitude problem.”

| Again, silence filled the room but not for long. After only five minutes, Hank yelled sold and took her out of the ring.

someone either bid high enough for her or no one wanted to deal with that fight. Each person had their own | preference. Hank brought out the next girl but this time, as soon as she was out, a loud growl vibrated the walls.

The girl tried to cower behind Hank.

Everyone watched in horror or delight when a guy walked around the ring, ripped her from Hank's grasp and marked her right then and there. Her head fell back as she passed out. More than one guy started yelling and walking forward.


“Don’t.” I warned as someone walked by me. Grabbing their hand, I held them back from going further. noveldrama

“STOP!” Hank yelled as the room got louder and louder. Everyone froze as he looked at the guy and the pasted out girl. “You have two options. Either pay 30k for her or I'll still sell her and you will have the pleasure of feeling everything she does.” @b “Pll fucking pay it.” Pushing Hank to the side, he walked

over to Frank and pulled out 30k in hundreds and slammed it on the table. Not even waiting, he stormed out of the room.

It was then, as he was leaving that I first noticed Tony. He was sitting with three other guys with a hat. If it wasn’t for the little bit of light across his face, I would have never seen him.

“Moving on.” Hank said. My attention was brought back to the next girl he

brought out. At this point, I stopped paying attention to the girls. Keeping one eye on Tony, I kept the other on the exit.

Watching him interact like he was just an average male, looking for a girl. It wasn’t until I noticed how he watched Zac move around that I realized that Vin got his information correct. Tony was so good at what he was doing that unless I was physically watching him, it would have gone completely unnoticed. .


Finally, the last girl of the night was brought out. Frank is expecting me to stay and help clean up but he also knows I am on a job. I'll need to find a way to come back and pay him.

Especially if Vin is going to try to cut him out. Keeping these relationships happy is important. Though, if [am

successful, I will be considered a traitor and never allowed back.

As the lights came back on, I watched 1 Tony make a beeline for the door. Not wanting to lose him, I followed suit.

There were many men trying to get out so I was stuck back a little.

My eyes instantly searched the surrounding area as soon as I was out of that place. Just out of the corner of my eye, I saw Tony slip into the treeline. There was no plan, no method to getting him. He was a master of the shadows and I had something to prove.

Trying to stay behind the trees, and being as quiet as possible, I kept him in my eye sight. All T knew was that I needed to be far enough away from here to not be seen but close enough

| that he can’t get away from me. This was my only shot.

More than once, Tony stopped and sniffed the area. The one thing I was good at was climbing trees. As quietly as I could, I started climbing as Tony took a piss. This would be a fifteen foot jump between me and him but this was the best shot I would get. Three...two....

one...














###Chapter 0425 

Colt POV “Someone is cutting it close.” Jacob said as he came into my dressing room.

“I know. I wasn’t going to miss Penny’s luna ceremony but I really need to be someone else. Something is going down and I’m not there for it.” My nerves were on high alert as I straightened my tie. In order for me to get back on time for the ceremony, I had to leave before whatever was going down was done. Assuming by the girls that were brought in, it was an auction.

Not only did it feel wrong to let it happen but I had to walk away from Gunther. Judging by the tracking, he was back at the castle. Something

inside me was telling me | was missing something very big, ®» “Like what?” Jacob asked.

“No idea but I just know I shouldn’t be here.” Sighing, I grabbed the colon and sprayed it a few times before looking at myself. € “Don’t let Penny hear you say that.” Jacob warned.

“I won't. You know that feeling that tells you, that you need to be somewhere? I just have a bad feeling that I shouldn’t have left. I should still be following Gunther.” “Did Alec come back with you?” Jacob was sitting down on a chair, picking at his fingernails.

“He did. We drove together and left together. Not about to leave one of us

behind without help.” “You might try putting on a smile before you walk out this door.” Jacob stood up and adjusted his tie before looking at me.


Knock! Knock! Knock! Jacob walked up to the door and answered it. “We came to see what the hold up was.” Alec and Jasper walked in.

“Just Colt getting in the right head space.” Jacob sighed as he stepped back and allowed them to enter.

“Are the girls ready?” I asked.

“They are. Penny had a slight freakout that you weren't here but after she saw me, she relaxed.” Alec stood with his hands in his pockets.

“That’s good.” I said, trying to convince myself that nothing bad was happening at the castle. — “Jacob... Jasper.... please get everyone ready, we will be down in five minutes.” Alec asked. It was a little more firm that left little room for arguing but still nicely.

“Okay.” Jacob said, clear of his request.

They walked out and shut the door behind them.

“Can’t shake the feeling?” Alec asked.

“No and it’s just getting worse.

Something is happening down there and we should be there.” Walking over to the window, I had to resist the urge to punchit.

“We can leave first thing in the

morning and go back down there but you need to push that to the side as much as possible and be present for Penny.” Alec didn’t make a move to me. noveldrama

“I know.” Pushing away from the wall, I just took a few deep breaths and readied myself. “Let go.” Muting the nagging in me, I focused only on the happy emotions. @& “That’s better...” Alec still frowned but opened the door. Soft music was playing as we made our way to the stage.

Penny wanted a black tie theme. It was alittle more dressy than some of these but that is what she wanted so that is what she got. All the men were in black suits and all the women were in black elegant dresses. Silver sparkling twigs

shot out from vases with water beads in the middle of the tables. Matching stretchy linings were covering every inch of the tables and chairs. Overall, I was in awe with how great everything looked. Penny kept the set up the same from Ice’s ceremony was I assume that was easy to switch things out.

It was only a minute of us standing here that the music shifted and the girls started walking down the aisle.

One by one, they took their seats and the music changed once more.

Everyone stood so I didn’t see Penny until she was half way down the aisle.

My breath got caught in my throat as her beauty really shined tonight. There was a faint glow to her that almost made my knees go weak. A fitted lacy gown hugged her tightly, really

showing off our babies. It long sleeves, off the shoulder dress with a deep V.

Her hair was curled and pinned at the base of her neck with little rhinestones making her glow really shine.














###Chapter 0426 

As she got closer, I started to realize there were tears in my eyes that I quickly tried to push away. It was fine for Penny to see that side of me but not all the other alphas and lunas that were in attendance tonight.

Penny handed off her flowers as I met her before the stage. Holding out my hand, I smiled at her. “You look so beautiful.” I whispered as we walked up to the front. Alpha Thomas was waiting patiently for us as we approached.

“Welcome!” He yelled out. “We have come to celebrate the union of Alpha Colt and Luna Penny. Cheers erupted, making Penny blush. Alpha Thomas held up his hand, quieting everyone.


“They have decided to do things a little differently, and start with the vows.

Alpha Colt, please go first.” a “penny, from the moment our eyes met and you became mine... I've felt like the luckiest man alive. Our lives have been anything but peaceful but you have adapted. More than once, you have risen above for not only my sake but for our packs. Your heart is massive as it makes it’s impact on the future generation, ensuring our future. More than once, you have stood up to me and helped me see things in a different light. The encouragement and support I have received from you has made me a better alpha and a better man. I know that will continue over to being the best dad I could be. I couldn’t imagine going through all this without you beside me. You have given me the

support and push that I needed to be able to do half the stuff I have done recently. Coming home to your smiling’ face gives me more satisfaction than anything else. With you beside me, I am unstoppable. We are a team... noveldrama

behind the desk and off. I love you.” Penny had tears running down her face as I spoke. I felt nothing but love coming from her and I tried to push all my love back at her. “Luna Penny, please take your turn.” After a moment, she started. “Growing up, we were not in the same circle but yet I was always

around you. I watched you grow up, going through different challenges and I watched you learn from each one of them.” She was wearing the bracelet I made for her. My eyes went to it and nodded in

understanding. “T admired your strength. I’ve always been someone that has been happy to be hiding behind someone. Never needing the recognition or anything but just seeing the smiles on people’s faces was enough for me. Since becoming your mate, I had to learn to be in the spotlight. There was a time I doubted my ability but someone wise told me to not compare myself to anyone. I could chose what my luna legacy was about.

Choosing what was dear to my heart was important and you did nothing but encourage and push me to achieve my dreams. I have been able to make these changes because of the strength I learned from you. Everyday, I watch you lead our pack. I see the respect in their eyes and how much they look up to you. You inspire me to continue to grow and be the best luna I can be...

and hopefully be the best mother I can be. With you beside me, I know I can handle anything that life throws at us. 1 love you.” I couldn’t help but put my hand on her belly. My babies were moving around, kicking at me. It was like they responded to my touch. Anywhere my hand went, they went.

“Please, repeat after me. I, Alpha Colt of the Blue Fang Pack, accept you Alpha Penny of the Midnight River pack as my mate and my luna.” @» I forget she has the title of Alpha. Even though she prefers to go by Luna, Alpha is still technically her title. “I, Alpha Colt of the Blue Fang Pack, accept Alpha Penny of the Midnight River Pack as my mate and my luna.













###Chapter 0427 

“Penny, repeat after me. “I, Alpha Penny of the Midnight River Pack, accept Alpha Colt of Blue Fang Pack as my mate and Alpha.” “I, Alpha Penny of the Midnight River Pack, accept Alpha Colt of the Blue Fang Pack as my mate and my Alpha.” Alpha Thomas held up the ceremonial knife. “With this knife, you will spill your blood. Combining your blood as one, making you as one. The connection between Alpha and Luna is unbreakable. The connection between Alpha and Alpha is even more intense.

From this day forward, Alpha Colt and Alpha Penny will be the strongest couple on this planet.” noveldrama

| Alpha Thomas handed me the knife and then gave the chalice to Penny.

Since she was so pregnant, we asked to not move to another place. So, I went ahead and cut my palm and allowed my blood to spill. After it was done, I tied my own hand with the cloth Alpha Thomas held. Switching sides, Penny sliced her palm and allowed some blood to spill before Alpha Thomas helped her tie the cloth around her hand.

Taking the cup from Penny, I swirled our blood together before drinking half of it. The rush I got was intense. I was a little light headed at first but thena - wave of power and raw strength filled me. Handing the cup to Penny, she finished it and I watched her go through the same emotions.

Only when we both settled down, did

Alpha Thomas continue. “It is with my great pleasure to announce, Alpha Colt and Luna Penny!” ~— We turned and waved at everyone cheering for us. Music started blasting as we made our way down the aisle.

Penny didn’t want a formal meal so as soon as we reached the end, the music changed to more of a party atmosphere. Servers came out with different appetizers and drinks. If I remember correctly, there was about ten different options. A table of them was still placed on the side for those to wanted to try

them all but people were still going to be walking around. £ “Congratulations!” Ice ran up to me and gave me a huge hug before moving on to Penny.

“Thanks, sis.” I said as I shook Alec’s

hand.

“Congratulations, Alpha.” I heard beside me. Looking over, Sherry was standing there in a beautiful but basic black gown. Her hair was curled and she appeared to have even put some makeup on. When my eyes met hers, she gave me a bow before looking nervously around.

“Thank you, Sherry. It is a pleasure seeing you this evening.” “I wanted to start here since it will be easy for me to slip out unnoticed if I get too overwhelmed.” She whispered.

“I'm just glad you made it to what you did.” Penny said in a perfect luna fashion.

“Oh shoot.” Ice looked down and back

up at Alec.

“What's wrong?” Penny asked.

“I need to pee but I didn’t think about how I was going to do it in this outfit.” Ice was wearing a very dressy pant suit.

The silk really complimented her belly but I knew she probably felt more at lease in that. @ “Pll help you.” Penny laughed. “I need to go anyway so we can help each other.” “Oh, thank you.” Ice was clearly satisfied with that.

“Thank the fucking goddess I don’t have to be pregnant.” Jacob looked at the girls as they left. Sherry went followed them to the bathroom.

“I'second that.” I muttered.

JER * “Alpha, there is a situation.” A guard mind-linked me.

“For fucks sake, what is it?” I NE responded.

“A dead body was found outside of our front gates of the pack.”













###Chapter 0428 

“Take it to the morgue and leave everything with the body. I will look at it when Luna’s ceremony is over.” | ordered the guard.

“Colt?” Penny’s voice sounded beside me. “What’s wrong?” Sparks erupted down my arm. Looking down at my beautiful mate, I tried to push my anger to the side.

“Nothing that needs addressed right now.” A slow song just started playing.

Grabbing he wrist, I pulled her out into the dance floor. We were the only ones dancing but I didn’t care. Surely, it wouldn’t take long for everyone else to join in. €» “Not omitting things from me, are you?” Penny asked, all knowingly.

“Maybe but do you really want to talk shop tonight?” I whispered, not wanting to tell her but not wanting to lie either.

“Not really but it was important enough to piss you off like this, shouldn’t I know about it?” “How can I be pissed off when I have you in my arms?” I tried to kiss her to get her mind off the subject but she dodged me.

“Colt... I thought we were a team.” Penny wrapped her arms around my neck and locked her hands together.

Her bump kept us a little bit apart but it was still comfortable to dance slowly.


“You really want to know that bad? Can’t just have fun tonight and worry tomorrow?” Sighing, I looked into her

eyes.

“Iwant you to confide in me. Don’t hide things because you think it will upset me. I want to stand beside you and handle that stuff. Even though turning a blind eye so I can focus on my projects might happen, I still want you to be able to talk to me.” “There is so much to tell. More specifically, there was a body found outside of our pack. I don’t know anything else but I had a bad feeling about leaving Gunther. We tracked him to a castle and then to an auction.” I told her in the mind-link.

“Why did you leave then?” Penny asked.

“Ineeded to come back to you.” “Oh...” Penny’s face scrunched up.

| “I wanted to come back. Even if I would have stayed, there isn’t anything that said something would have happened. T might have just followed him back to the castle. Without more men, it would have been incredibly dangerous for Alec and I to even interfere with anything. I would have had to just watch from afar so it was probably best I wasn’t there.” “You probably would have jumped in there and that could have resulted in you being injured or something.” Penny agreed.

“Exactly, you did me a huge favor by making sure I came home.” “Who was the guy?” Penny asked, still in the mind-link. More and more people were dancing beside us.

“No idea. They just told me they found

someone. I'll look and see who it is when we get home.” “Do you need to leave now?” Penny asked as the song stopped. noveldrama

“He won't be much more dead in a few hours.” Walking over to the table, everyone was sitting down and talking.

“Penny! If you had to chose between Jasper and Jacob to win in a foot race, who would it be?” Kris asked me.

“Really?” I asked as I pulled out a chair for Penny and then took my own seat.

“Cripple over here thinks he can still beat me.” Jacob laughed. Sherry just looked like she was in pain trying to smile.

“Without a doubt!” Jasper laughed.

“Has these drinks always been this strong?” Emmy asked. Jasper just shook his head at her and pulled her close. @ “Aw, my little light weight.” “Having a baby really fucks with you.” Emmy shrugged, agreeing with Jasper.

“Why is this an argument?” Penny asked, taking a drink of water.

“I think you would win.” Emmy hiccuped before setting her glass down.

“Jasper was boasting about completing amile in five minutes.” Kris glared at Emmy’s drink as she sat back.

“That is great!” Penny said with a

smile.















###Chapter 0429 

“Little slow, bro.” Jacob gave him a ‘sorry about your luck’ look.

“Alright, I accept your challenge.” Jasper sat up and smirked at Jacob.

“A challenge? When did I challenge you?” Jacob was back peddling hard.

“] heard it and accept it as well.” Alec said very alpha like. “We shall havea one mile race. Colt and I will organize the event to be held in the next week or two.” «gcared?” Jasper looked at Jacob like he already won.

“you wish, Crip.” Jacob held up his drink to Jasper. Jasper met his drink to Jacob’s and the toast sealed the deal.

«1 Jove how parties bring us together.” I said, shaking my head at their level of childishness.

“Speaking of parties, are you girls going to have a baby shower?” Sherry asked.

“Qh, yeah at some point. In a month, we have that Halloween Party.” Penny said.

“We should do it soon. With triplets, who knows when you will give birth.

Multiples always come early.” Ice said, trying not to smile too big. @ “I haven't even boughten anything.” Penny looked worried.

“We can look through it all tomorrow and buy whatever we need.” I told her to ease her mind.

«phat would be great!” Penny breathed a sigh of relief.

“Do you know the genders?” Ice leaned forward in excitement.

“We do but I want to keep it a secret right now.” Penny said to my surprise.

“Aw! Really? How will I know what to buy you?” “She is having three babies, I think you could probably buy her a little of everything and it will get used.” Jacob said as he took a sip of his drink.

“He isn’t wrong. There are so much stuff that is greens, yellows, grays and blacks!” “Well, sure but what if I want to buy a dress?” Ice challenged.

| “You are going to buy your niece a dress and not a free tattoo?” Jasper teased.

“They will get that anyway.” “I never got a free tattoo!” I complained. noveldrama

“1 didn’t either and I'm her mate.” Alec grumbled.

“First off, I charged you before we were even mated. Afterwards, what’s yours is mine so whatever. As for you, Colt, you always paid me extra since you knew I was saving to travel. Third, my niece or nephews can have whatever they want, when they want it and Aunt Ice doesn’t say no.” “We might need to find a better babysitter.” Penny whispered like she was trying to hide it but she was loud

enough for everyone to hear.

“Hey!” Ice faked looking hurt but the rest of us laughed.

“We aren’t raising spoiled children here.” I said.

“You were a spoiled kid.” Jacob laughed.

“Don’t act like you didn’t enjoy the benefits!” Ice quickly jumped in.

“We should go streaking!” Emmy yelled and put her arms out above her head.

«_Ithink it’s time we head home.” Jasper said as he looked at her with worry in his eyes. We all busted up laughing as Emmy danced to the music by herself.

“Is she really that drunk?” Sherry

asked, laughing as well.

“She is. I haven't seen her this drunk in a long time.” Ice stood up and we all followed. “This was a lovey party.

Congratulations!” “Thank you!” Penny beamed.

“Look at that. A whole party and no interruptions!” Jasper sighed as he tossed Emmy over his shoulder.

“QOH! Look at this ass!” Emmy grabbed two big handfuls of Jasper’s ass, making him jump and slap her on the ass hard.

“Quit that!” “Oh, daddy!” Emmy laughed. Jasper just rolled his eyes and got bright red as he walked out of the room.

“1 Jike drunk Emmy.” Ice laughed as

she put her arm through Alec’s as we | made our way out of the event center, | The lights came on and the staff.

started tearing stuff down.

“Give it a few months and all you girls can have a fun night.” Alec muttered in dull excitement.

“Please, try to rein in that enthusiasm.” Penny laughed.











###Chapter 0430 

“No can do.” Alec nodded as he pulled Ice to their car. Jasper was in the distance trying to get a fighting Emmy in his car and Jacob headed straight to his. We walked over to the car Emmy brought for us to head home in.

Opening her side, I let her get in before going to the drivers side.

“Do you want me to drop you off and then go to the morgue or do you want to go with me?” I asked, putting the car in drive, we were first out of the parking lot.

“I’ll go with you.” Penny said simply, like we were just going to get ice cream.

“You sure?” I asked.

“Sure am.” Penny looked out the window. Reaching over, I took her hand in mine as we drove the hour home. At some point, Penny’s eyes closed but her head never left the head rest. It wasn’t until we pulled into the driveway at the pack house did I wake her up. noveldrama

“We’re home already?” She asked, looking around confused.

“We are. You fell asleep quickly.” Getting out, I walked over to her side and opened the door for her.

“I haven't been sleeping the best.” “Why didn’t you just let me take you home?” I asked as we walked inside.

“TI won't be sleeping better until this belly is gone.” Yeah, there wasn’t

anything I could do to help with that.

“Maybe you need more pillows under you for support?” I tossed an idea out there.

“Maybe.” Penny yawned as the morgue door came into view.

“Alpha...Luna.” The guard bowed.

“Are you the one that found him?” I asked as he opened the door.

“No, patrol did. I have been standing guard until you came.” We walked inside and the guard went over to the cooler. Opening the door, he pulled the dead guy out. “Is this how he was found?” Penny took a deep breath in and a few steps back. Looking at her, I waited to

make sure she was steady before looking back at the guy. His face wasn’t touched but every inch of himwas black and blue. That is, where the skin was still attached. Chunks of flesh were crudely torn form his body. Some were hanging on by a thread and other were just completely missing.

“Yes. He was naked when we found him, except he had this stuffed into his mouth.” The guard handed me a phone.

Pressing the side button, it turned on and asked for a thumb print. “Did you or anyone open his phone?” “No, Alpha.” The guard had taken a step back and watched from a distance.

Grabbing the guys thumb, I held it up to the thumb print and pressed down.

It took a few tries and angles but I finally got it opened. The background was black. First thing I did was open the text messages. No numbers were saved but I recognized the only number on there that was listed. It was mine.

My blood ran cold as I read the message. Looking at the guy, I never seen his face before and this wasn’t a coincidences. Vin found out about my guy and he had him mutilated.

“Colt?” Penny asked. She must have felt the shift in my emotions. “You know this man?” “Ido.” Was all I said as I shifted through the phone. Looking for any trace of anyone else or any clues. No pictures. No emails. No saved numbers.

It was like the phone had a factory

reset and then only texted my phone. It was a message I got right after he called me when I was on my way to follow Gunther. Was that was Gunther was doing at the auction? I thought he was following Zac and I didn’t remember seeing Zac at the auction.

He very well could have been since I had to leave but this mean Vin is way ahead of me.

“Who is it?”









###Chapter 0431 

“Was there anything else found on him?” I'asked, trying to keep my cool.

“No, that was it.” “I'want a full examination with fingerprints and everything on this man.” I commanded before grabbing Penny’s arm and pulling her out of the morgue. noveldrama

“Colt? What is going on?” Penny asked again as we left the morgue.

“Give me a second.” I said and continued to guide us out of the packhouse and into the car. As soon as we were both locked in, then I pulled out my phone. Dialing Alec’s number, I had to wait three rings before he finally |

answered.

“This better be important.” “My informant was found dead outside of my pack tonight.” Silence. Alec didn’t speak but there was some wrestling of clothing before I could hear Ice in the back ground.

“Who's on the phone?” “Are you sure?” Alec asked, ignoring Ice.

“His phone was found on him with our last exchange.” “Damn. Vin?” “That’s what I think. Not sure how Vin found out about it or how he even found him.” “We need to find his informant.” Alec

| muttered.

“Alec, he was mutilated. We have to assume he talked.” % “He didn’t know anything that would cause us concern, did he?” “Nothing major. Just kept tabs on Zac.” I said, calming down.

“He’s had a bullseye on his back for years, this wouldn’t change that.” Alec was trying to rationalize it.


“Damn.” “Yeah. I’ll come over tomorrow and we can figure out our next move.” Alec sighed.

“Okay.” I said before I hung up.

“I take it that was your informant?” Penny said after a moment,

“Yeah. He had been following Zac.

Basically just keeping me updated on things. He was one that dad used and was the reason dad always stayed one step ahead.” “Vin tortured him.” Penny said quietly.

“Yes, he did.” “You should have stayed. You could have saved him.” Penny sounded like she was crying. Looking over, I saw a single tear slip down her cheek.

“We don’t know that. Vin could have had him way before I even got there.” “What do we do now?” Penny asked as I put the car into drive.

“Go to bed and figure out our next move in the morning,” I said. I wasn’t

sure how to feel. I was more pissed than anything but I don’t understand how he even figured out who it was.

This was a low blow and now I needed to play on the same field as him.

Getting home, Penny and I walked up to our bedroom. “Can you unzip me?” Penny asked as she turned around.

“Sure.” My mind was focused on anything Vin might know now. So, when I unzipped Penny and walked away, I wasn’t fully prepared for her to come up and unbuttoned my shirt for me.


I was only half paying attention when she pulled it off me and started working on my pants. My hands ran up and down her arms but my mind was still focused on what I could do about Vin.

Sparks erupted across my chest but it wasn’t until my dick entered something warm and moist that my attention got adverted completely back to Penny. Looking down, she was looking up at me with my dick

in her mouth.

“Pennnnny.” I moaned. One hand went to the back of her head and the other rested against the wall for support.

Fuck, I loved when she was straight forward. It had been so long since we made love. With the pregnancy and everything else going on, one of us was always passed out before anything could happen.

Her hands wrapped around my legs and dug into them. I had to force my knees to stay straight and not buckle under the pleasure. She didn’t let up and didn’t slow down. The constant

pressure was quickly becoming my downfall as she started moving her nails down my legs. = Twisting her hair in my hand, I pumped into her mouth until I shot my load deep down her throat. Penny didn’t even gag as I finished. Black spots clouded my vision as I worked myself down, but Penny stood up, licking her lips clean.

“Fuck.” I groaned as I didn’t wait but wrapped my arm around her back and the other around her neck, pressing my lips firmly against her. Penny’s body melted against mine. I took one step forward and she took one step back until we toppled over the bed. Careful not to land on the babies, I loved so I could remove her bra and panties.

“Oh, Colt!” She moaned as I slipped

my finger between her legs.

“Fuck, your so wet for me.” As my hand massaged her clip, my tongue went to her sensitive spot on her inner neck. Just to the left of her throat, there was a little sweet spot that really turned her on. @& As soon as I found her. Her hand wrapped around my dick and started pumping away. Penny was

squirming under me. Working these points really got her going in seconds. Stopping right before she came, I moved my face between her legs.

“Please!” She begged.

I didn’t bother answering as I just lowered myself. Due to her bump, I couldn’t see her face but her hands grabbed handfuls of the sheets when my tongue licked her lips. Her legs

moved up and down the harder I sucked.


















###Chapter 0432 

“Oh! OH! OH!” Penny got louder and louder the faster I moved until she was about to cum and I stopped. Her eyes rolled back but I didn’t give her a second before I shoved my dick deep into her core.

Instantly, her head snapped back as she screamed out my name. Each time I pumped in and out, I watched her body react to mine. Legs trembling, her hands wrapped in her own hair with her eyes stuck on mine. Her swollen plump breast bounced with each thrust, almost choking her as I moved.

«yES!” She screamed as her orgasm hit at the same time mine did. Pumping a few more times, I made sure I was

empty before falling beside her on the bed.

“Thanks.” She muttered as she patted my hip.

“Thanks?” I asked, laughing as I tried to catch my breath.

“Good job?” Penny looked at me and smiled. “Good effort? Which adjective would you like?” “None of those.” Penny laughed as she rolled over into my arms and we fell asleep together.

“What time is Alec coming over today?” Penny asked. I had gotten up and got dressed by the time she even opened her eyes.

«I am going to go meet him at our office. Come up with a game plan on

how we want to move forward.

That was a big fuck you from Vin so now we need to repay him.” ~~ “Any ideas on how you are going to do that?” Penny asked.


“None. I'll call you when we are finished.” I said as I walked over.

Bending down, I gave her a kiss before walking out. “Love you.” “Love you!” She yelled but T'was already on the stairs.

It was record time between making it to my car and the time arrived at the packhouse. Either there just wasn’t any traffic or I drove way too fast. Either way, no one died so it was okay...right? «About time you got here.” Alec was sitting on the porch when I got out of 2/0

my car.

“How long have you been here?” “Five minutes.” Alec shrugged as I walked past him.

“Barely anything.” Rolling my eyes, we made it to my office before I set my keys down.

«Kristen had a plan for us.” Alec crossed his arms over his chest as he looked at me.

«What is that?” I asked. Sitting down in my chair, I looked at him, waiting.

“Bomb the castle.” «Do what?” asked to make sure I heard correctly. noveldrama

«Flatten the bitch.” Alec took a seat.

“What about all the innocent people in there?” I asked. Surely there was some girls in there that didn’t deserve to die.

“Every war has collateral damage.” Alec shrugged.


“Kirsten came up with this?” I asked, not sure I believed it.

“She said find a way in and poison them. I said flatten it.” Alec shrugged.

“That sounds more like it. Poisoning them will still kill innocent people.” “We could try to sneak in and do some damage.” Alec offered.

“Like how?”

“What if we use Zac to our advantage?” Alec had a look in his eye that made me feel like I wasn’t going to like this plan.

“Let him get captured and get brought into the castle. He can release some poison or something.” “Maybe, or he could end up like my informant.” “Do you know when the next sell or event will be?” Alec kept on thinking.

“1 don’t. If we do anything to the castle, they will realize that Gunther and Kara are being tracked.” “That is if they haven’t already. You did show yourself to Gunther.” Alec reminded me.

“He didn’t find it since I can still see

where he is and it is moving.” “Flattening the castle isn’t a bad idea.” Alec said again. img “It really isn’t. I can’t stand them anyway. Just feels wrong to put that many people in danger.” “We don’t know how many innocent people are even there.” Alec was playing devil’s advocate.

“True but one innocent life is too much.” “Why don’t we stand guard over the | castle and as people leave it, kill them and hide their bodies. Then, they just don’t go back and Vin just is having his men mysteriously disappear.” “That’s not a bad idea but that is slow.

I want to punch him in the gut like he did us.” 1 wanted to hurt him as bad as

he hurt us.

“We could use a sniper and shoot : people through the window. Do it when | they are more alone so it isn’t obvious until more people are dead.” “I like that. A sniper can be hundreds of yards away to even a mile.” “I’m good with a sniper.” Alec said with an evil grin.

“Why was this not your first plan?” I asked.

«1 still want to flatten it. Fuck them all and just drop a few bombs.” Alec sighed.













###Chapter 0433 

I have another idea.” Alec leaned forward.

“What's that?” I was ready to kill someone.

“My team has a newly developed airborne virus. It’s a viral bug that when breathed in, causes your blood to not clot and you bleed out. Similar to snake venom. We would need to introduce it into his air conditioning system. There is an antidote we would need to give Gunther and Kara.” «Why wasn't this plan A?” “well, it’s not 100% effective and still lightly experimental. They might still live. Their systems might not be deadly.”

«well, we can watch and who doesn’t die can get shot.” I said simply. Even if it doesn’t work, we can still watch them panic.

«still need to get the antidote to Gunther and Kara.” Damn. “What is it?” “p pill.” «Hgmm.” There wasn’t a lot of options.

«gneak in and lay it in their bed?” I was clearly aware of the sarcasm in my voice.

«or command a girl to doit.” Alec looked at me.

“What?” “penny took over that pack. As her mate, you are their Alpha too. If they didn’t denounce their ties when they

were forced to serve Vin, they will have to obey you.” “well, shit. Still need to get close though.” Standing up, I moved to the window.

«you would. Every move you make will have to be precise. You can’t make a mistake or you will be dead. We can’t take an army.” «we could take a few men. Not many.

just the top of the elite. They would have to stay next to you and that will be hundreds of yards away.” «We can have a few people as coverage.


My men are trained.” I saw Alec shrug in the window reflection.

«what's life without a little excitement.” I said dully.

“They are still at the castle. Might as

ls" +15 BONUS well get a move on while they are still there. Otherwise, they might take a trip and we could miss them.” Alec stood up.

“Alright...” The office door opened and Penny walked in. “How soon can.

You be ready?” @&» Shutting the door, Penny walked to her desk and sat down. “Give me an hour or so. I need to get my men and things ready.” “Alright. Call me when your ready.” I sighed.

“Penny.” Alec nodded at her and walked out.

“So, I take it you are going to be gone again.” Penny didn’t even look at me but kept looking at her computer.

“Yeah, not sure how long.” I said as I

walked over to her. When 1 got close enough, I saw she was looking at baby stuff.

“We can’t let that man’s death go.” Penny sighed.

“Ilike the dark greens but the light shade.” I said pointing to a pattern.


“Sage green?” “Sure. I like that green with blue and creams or a deep blue with grays.” I pointed out a few more designs.

“What about for our daughter?” “Is there a flower design in that color scheme?” I asked.

“Sure.” Penny types something in and floral designs popped up.

“This one.” I said and pointed one out.

“Do you like that?” I asked.

“I'do actually.” Penny sounded surprised. “Thanks!” “We will need to paint their rooms.

These colors don’t match what is in there.” I watched her shift through a few different things and add it to her chart.

“This is like....stupid expensive.” Penny looked at me.

Not wanting to see how bad this is going to hurt, I didn’t look. “We have three kids coming, it wasn’t going to be cheap. Pick out everything we need.

You need to make a registry for the baby shower so you can put some items on that.” “True...” Penny looked unsure.

“It’s really okay. We will be fine and we

don’t exactly have time to look around, Just buy what you picked out.” Kissing her cheek, I stood up and walked over to my desk.


“When do you need to leave?” “As soon as Alec is ready. We set up a plan. Not sure how good it will be but we shall see. The hard part is attacking without giving Gunther and Kara away.” “Hopefully you just kill Vin and then it’s a moot point.” Penny said like she was only half listening.

“That would be the hope anyway.” “Don’t get killed. I’m not raising triplets by myself.” Penny gave me a look. I was looking at the trackers when I glanced up and saw her expression.

ww TY EON “I'll do my best.” Smirking, 1 got up.

Most of my stuff was still packed but | needed to pack more clothes. Going to the closet, I started pulling out a few different combat options.

“Exactly how long do you plan on being gone?” Penny’s voice was much closer than I expected.

“T’honestly don’t know. Hopefully just a few days. Depends on how well the plan gets executed.” “Is it dangerous?” Looking out, Penny was sitting on the floor, against the wall. She was watching me toss stuff on the floor with partial amusement and concern.

“Everything is dangerous but Alec will be there and we are bring the top of our elite men. The goal is to not be seen so hopefully I won’t be in any real

danger.” I emphasized real like going wasn’t actual danger, being there wasn’t actually dangerous... just not fully safe. @» “Ihave so much stuff to do around here. It’s a pity Sherry isn’t able to work. Doing the basic stuff is getting hard.” Penny sighed.

“Hire an assistant. You know 90% of this pack. Hire someone to be your right hand person. We have talked about this.” “I'know but it’s hard giving up control.” “Then hire someone to drive you around in a golf cart all day.” I said more sarcastically than I factual.

“That’s not a bad idea.” Apparently, she took it factual.

SR TE TY “Glad to help but you are carrying three babies. Please take it easy, you heard the doctor.” — “I'have like a month left before I am unable to function. Honestly, what am 1 going to go as for the Halloween party?” I knew it was a joke but at the same time, it wasn’t.

“Moon Goddess with your belly being the world. Little Red Riding Hood. Hell, cut up a baby doll and make three sets of arms and legs coming out of your belly with blood.” “Wow, that was a lot.” Penny

looked at me like I grew three heads.

“Hey, that Moon Goddess wasn’t bad.” I said defensively. I thought that was good for coming up with it at the drop of a dime.

“It was actually. I'll keep thinking but 1 like that idea.” “Thanks. This is all I should need. I have a few more things but then I need to get done and we will head out.” “Yeah. Just be safe please.” Penny sighed as she looked at me.

“Iwill. I'll text you often and let you know I am alive and well.” I promised as I kissed her cheek. noveldrama

“You better.” She said as my phone rang.













###Chapter 0434 

We had to take a van this time. Alec was driving, I was in the passenger seat and five men were in the back.

These men ranged from skinny and short to tall and wide. However, they all excelled in their own ways with their own specialties. However, all of them were extensively trained on the sniper and long range rifles.

Their hand to hand combat were impressive but it was knife skills that really shined. If we had twenty more of these guys, we would rule the entire world. Only Alec and I have ever beat them and we had the alpha power advantage.

By the time we arrived, it was late into the night. Since everyone had slept the

drive and Alec and I switched off, we drove straight to the castle. The trackers were still there, moving g around the castle. Parking about four miles from the castle, we walked three until we found a good lookout position that was higher up.

Alec and I waited as the men set everything up. The only thing making any noise was the owls hooting in the distance. Taking a sniper, I got on my stomach and looked through the scope.

It was insane how good I could see.

People walking around the castle, even this late at night shocked me. Every room in the castle was pitch black. We would need to scope out all the cameras he had up. Thankfully, we already had a good idea of where they were at and what traps he had but we

needed a much larger area this time.

However, we had a secret weapon there. The smallest guy, Blake, was actually a tiny due. So much so that he wolf was literally the size of a normal wolf. His skills were so good that he even moved and

acted like the animal.


With no human component to it, his wolf blended in so perfectly that he actually spend a summer with a wolf pack. Using him, we would be able to map out the layouts and blend in.

I watched him shift and run off. The only down side is wolves roam in packs. If we had a single wolf walking around the castle, that would look suspicious. He needed to join a pack and get them to come around the castle. Till then, we were collecting data.

Pulling out my phone, I texted Penny.

‘We made it, turning phone off, text in the morning. Love you.” Immediately turning it off, I put it in my bag and waited.

Alec had a map that he pulled out from last time. It was what we marked last time. We were able to even get some from when we watched Gunther leave the castle. Following him was easy enough and I don’t think he even realized he was being followed.

Though, he did turn around a few times so maybe he did.

“How many guys did you see?” Alec came over me to. Going back down to my stomach, I started counting.

“At least five.” I kept looking around for me but didn’t see much. “There is one person at the front doors and one

at each corner from what I can see.

Then there are men walking around.” “At least two men in direct eye contact at all times over each part of the castle.” Alec summarized.

“Seems that way.” The front door opened and I watched Vin step out.

“Holy fuck.” I said, surprised.

“What?” “Vin is standing at the front door! Get me a bullet!” I whispered as I kept my eyes on him. Alec moved around behind me before shoving a bullet into my hand. I had to take my eye off Vin to load the gun. Fuck, if I was able to just shoot him and leave, that would be fucking great! Loading it in, I looked through the

TE scope again but this time, he wasn’t there. “Do you see him?” “Lost him.” My heart rate was going so fast that I had to close my eyes and focus on steading myself. A fast heart rate is the difference between a kill and amiss. Looking through again, I noticed the men running around more urgently. “Something is happening.” I said. I had a weird feeling about this. A few more men got their guns and laid down beside me.

Alec grabbed one and looked too. The | front door opened and Gunther stepped out, looking rather pissed. He was looking at the men, yelling something but I wasn’t a lip reader.

“Can anyone read his lips?” Alec asked.

“Not from this distance.” Someone replied.

“From the East!” I heard. We all moved our attention to the East as three men were dragging another man in. noveldrama

“What the...” I watched as they brought in three more men. In total, four men were kneeling before Vin and Gunther. I couldn’t see Vin but I assumed he was still there but behind a tree.

“Colt, where is Zac on the tracker?” Alec asked.

“P11 kill him.” I whispered angerly as I got up and went to my bag. Pulling out my phone, I had to turn it on.

We watched as the men were hit a few times but nothing more than that.

Their mouths looked like they were

yelling but we couldn’t make anything out.

A faint sound of a gun went off that caused me to freeze. Laying back down, I looked through the scope just in time to see a second man get shot in the head. His body fell over next to another one that was laying face first in the dirt.

“Colt...” Alec asked.

My phone just finished turning on. As | quickly as I could, I pulled up the tracker and looked at it. “Mother fucker....” The gun went off a third time.















###Chapter 0435 

“Damit, what the fuck are we going to do?” I asked.

“Hold up.” Alec said.

“What's happening?” Laying down and looking through the scope, I saw as the men stood up. The guards brought them inside the castle before Vin and Gunther walked in behind them.

Closing the door, the guards outside started walking around like they did before.

“They went inside.” “Fuck, they will probably torture him the way they did my informant.” “Colt, you can’t let that happen.” Alec sighed.

-y CV VNU “Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Okay, this is what is going to happen. I am going to move in now. Somehow, I'll sneak into the castle. You boys need to get eyes on all sides of the castle and provide cover for me. I'll plant the damn pills and find the bastard.” “Colt, you're going in basically blind.” Alec looked over at me. I couldn’t see his expression but I could feel his judgement.

“Do you have a better idea? Would you like to go?” I asked as I dug through my bag. Pulling out different knives and other objects that might help me.


“You heard him. I need a man on every side of the castle. Not a single window is to be dark.” The men instantly grabbed what they

wy TV BUNS needed and walked off in different directions. “Alec, if something happens to me...” ~ “Don’t. Don’t say that.” Alec shook his head.

“I’m serious man. This is the single most dangerous thing I have ever done.


If something goes wrong...” I had to pause. The thought of not coming home to my mate and my children...

“I'll take care of her.” Alec put his hand on my shoulder. “You just focus on coming out of there alive.” Alec handed me my ear piece. Turning it on, we waited until the men all got into position. “Alright men, there is no room for error. All your training comes down to this. Alpha Colt’s life is on the line, don’t fuck this up.” Alec nodded

at me. Time to start my journey.

I'had a little ways before the security cameras started, however, | stayed against the trees as much as possible.

Pushing Penny from my mine, I had to work on steading my heart rate.


Irregular heart beat is how mistakes are made. Calm heart, calm mind. That is what I kept repeating over and over in my head. @ “Getting close to the cameras. Slow your pace.” T heard in my ear. It would be stupid of me to not listen to these men so I did just as I was told. Hugging the trees, my feet slowed down so minimal sounds to nothing was heard.

“STOP!” I heard urgently. My body became a statue. “Go on the other side of the tree, there is a camera with

thermal scanning. Wait till I tell you then move to the tree to the north.” Slipping around the tree, I waited as my eyes looked around. Even with wolf vision, I didn’t see a single camera.

“There is a camera to the west so stay on the east side.” I heard another man say.

“Now!” Jumping to the tree to the north and hugging the east side, my breath stayed slow and steady.

Pausing, I didn’t move in case there was another camera but no one said a word. I almost wished they would tell me what tree for the entire way but since I didn’t want to speak and let my breath get picked up, I stayed quiet.


Slowly, I moved from tree to tree.

Everyone was quiet enough that | started to wonder if they were still there. Every now and then, I would pause and wait. Not sure why but I waited for someone to jump out and yell boo or even a sound of a gun. After a few moment of nothing, I would move on to another tree.


“Thermal on your right. Hold till signal.” T heard. My back instantly pressed against the tree and waited.

Thankfully, T didn’t have to wait long.

“Now!” He said, my body reacted instantly as I moved to the next tree.

“I can’t be certain but watch your footing. I am catching glimmers of string reflectant.” Crouching down, I tried to look at the forest floor in the moon light. It was almost impossible to see but I started noticing a few

random flickers as well, | Stepping over a few strings, I was able to make it further still. Though, T still have over a mile to go. At this rate, it would take me all night just to get to the castle. Inching my way to the castle was tedious but I did it.

Thankfully, when I finally did get to the castle, the guards looked half asleep. Walking around with their heads pointed upwards to keep their eyes open.

“You will have exactly a five second window to leap from the tree you are against, to that bush under the window. There are thermals on the trees and the guards are canvassing.

Best option is to tuck and roll. Stay low and don’t get too high.” Understood. Need to pull some James noveldrama

Bond shit and sneak around. I waited for what felt like hours. More than once, the guards were rotating and | moving. I wasn’t sure where the window was but I started noticing the guards and when they weren’t paying attention. I assume the guard was getting the timing right in his head but it was taking longer than I was comfortable with.

“As soon as I say go, go. Hold your position.” He said. Holding my breath, I waited in the crouch position.

“Three... two... one...GO!” As soon as I heard the G sound, my body leaped forward. Staying low like he requested, my eyes only saw the bush. Never once did I look at the guard but as soon as my head hit the dirt, my body became a statue. The dive was

easy, being still in the bush on my back was another. Still, I became a pole and just waited to see if they spotted me.















###Chapter 0436

 As the footsteps pasted, my body 3 relaxed. Instant relief flooded me. Not that the danger was over but the key was to take one obstacle at a time. I was relying so heavily on our men that it was a little anxiety ridden.

“Not detected. Hold position.” I heard in my ear. Shifting over, I stayed below the bush but moved more on my legs so I was in a better position if was discovered. More than once, I just keep telling myself to stay calm. Calm heart, calm breathing. Adrenaline kept trying to take over, making me want to just rambo out of the bush and attack everyone. However, I kept pushing that down and taking things slow. Slow and steady wins the races.

“In ten seconds, reach up and check if the window is unlocked.” | Looking up, the window was only about five feet off the ground.

However, I was still going to have to jump to get over it. Normally, this wouldn’t be an issue but I was judging my time frame was incredibly limited.

“Now!” I was ready. Quickly standing up, I barely lifted it and shut it again before going back down under the bush.

“It’s unlocked.” I heard someone say.

“What's inside that room?” Alec asked.

I couldn’t judge his tone but he sounded calm.


“Appears to be a storage room. I can

see shelves and boxes.” “So, stuff that can fall and create » . ~~ noise.” Alec summarized with annoyance. noveldrama

“It’s either that, find another window or walk through the front door.” “There appears to be a cellar door in the back.” Another guy side, unsure.


“No visual inside.” “That’s too risky. There could be prisoners or fuck who knows what.” Alec sighed.

“He has about a fifteen second window to stand up, open the window and close it before the thermal will catch him.” Well fuck me. I couldn’t give him them my input as I kept hearing footsteps walk past me. One small whisper and I

am found. Fuck, breathing too loudly and I am found. = “Colt, you are going to have to make a quick judgement call. Open the window and assess what it looks like. If you need to close it and wait for the next window, do so.” Alec was being very direct. He didn’t like this plan but we didn’t have many options.

“Your window is in five....four...three...

two... NOW!” Standing up, my fingers grabbed the frame and pushed up. The way it slid up was easy but my eyes immediately saw a sensor. Slamming it shut, I got low and ran along the castle walls.

“BREECH!” I heard people yell as they ran past me as I continued to run in the opposite direction.


“Shit! There was a sensor!” I heard in my ear. £1 “The window! Look around!” The guards shouted. More footsteps filled around me. As I snuck up to the front of the castle, there was a small crawl space under the stairs that led to the front door. As quickly as I could, my body flattened on the earth before snaking in.

Trying to cover my tracks, I pushed my hand back out and smoothed the dirt around. Dust fell on my face as more men ran down the front and began to look around.

“Look in the bushes!” I heard. My breathing wanted to start panting but I kept my body steady. Flattening my body against the wall, I tried to blend in.

“The fuck! Colt! Where are you?” My ear was blowing up but between them and the guards, I couldn’t hear | anything really well. Just catching bits and pieces of it.

“Stairs.” I whispered as I looked around.


“Can you get to the other side of the castle? Most everyone is looking around the window. The door is open if you can slip out on the other side and get inside. Move quickly as they could see you at any point. No one is guarding the front right now.” Trying not to think, I just moved.

Crawling to the other side, the opening was blocked by a wooden barrier. It was nailed in. If this wasn’t a sign to bail, I wasn’t sure what was but I didn’t have an option at this point. Slowly, I

pushed against the wood. Inch by inch, the nails groaned as they came out.

Thankfully, the bushes were full, thick” and completely covered me as I slipped out from the stairs. Pushing the wood back against the stairs, so if anyone looked, it looked normal.


“Time.” I whispered as I got ready.

“Hold....hold...hold.... get ready.........

Now!” As much as I wanted to look around and gage for myself if it was clear, I had to trust my men. Jumping up, I just took off. Slipping out front the bushes, I'moved out and ran up the stairs.

Thankfully, it was still completely black out and only the guards had flashlights out. Opening the front door, I tried to make myself as small as possible and slipped in.

“Everything normal. False alarm.” 1 | heard the guard yelled. ) Looking around, the foyer was as what you would expect from a castle.

Massive ceilings that echoed everything. Marble and velvet lined the floors with a huge chandelier. There was a door to my immediate left.

Jumping over, I took a chance and opened it. The only relief I had so far was looking into a broom closet at this point.

Right as the front door handle shook, I slipped in the closet and closed the door. “You fuckers are tracking in dirt!” I heard Vin yell out. “This is the second time I am woken up tonight! Clean this up now!” His footsteps stomped away but my heart rate spiked as I was looking directly at the broom.

Moving to the back of the closet, I was just able to get behind the shelf when the door opened up. “Fucking dick.” 1 heard someone mutter as he grabbed the broom and closed the door.

Looking at my boots, they were covered in dirt. If I was going to be successful, I needed to get ride of my dirty clothes.
















###Chapter 0437 

Untying my boots, I was able to slip those off easily enough. Then came my vest, however, I needed my vest. Doing the next best thing, I just shook off my clothes, allowing the dirt to fall to the floor. Surly, they wouldn't find this mess until after I was long gone.

“Yeah! YEAH!” The door suddenly opened and I froze. My hands were visible in the light that was coming in from the foyer. “Kiss my ass.” A guy whispered as he tossed in the broom.

He must not have been paying attention because the closet shut a moment later.

“Can you give us an update?” Alec asked in my ear.

[didn’t answer right away. Instead, 1

finished cleaning off my body and listened to the world around me, The night was running out so my time frame was getting shorter and shorter, Once I was sure no one was around, I responded back.

“In a closet off the foyer. Getting ready to move.” “Holy Fuck. Good, your alive.” I heard someone say in relief.


“Any ideas on where I am going?” I asked as my hand wrapped around the door handle.

“None. Dungeons are usually where the prisoners are kept. However, you need to give the antidote to Gunther first.” “You boys better be ready.” I said before shutting up completely. Turning

the knob, I'looked out into the lobby.


No sign of guards and assuming they put Gunther and Kara in a guest room, | [just started opening doors and looking around.

“Most likely there will be cameras.

Look for anything that could be considered suspicious. I put a laser in your vest that will just make the picture go fuzzy. It only works if the laser is on the camera. The person watching it will think a bug or something is on it and not worry about it. Chances are, there are cameras in every single room. Stay to the shadows and careful with your movements.” So, no pressure. Just be a cameleon and blend in. Getting to the first door, I opened it and didn’t see anything. The bed was empty but since I didn’t move

the door more than an inch, I just shut it and continued on. Going to the next door, I did it again. Cracking the door — open, I peaked in. When there wasn’t anyone in the bed, I closed it and kept going. So far, I found a bathroom, three closets and four bedrooms.

Usually, the kitchen and living rooms are on one side and sleeping rooms are in the rooms above. Taking the stairs, I went as slowly as possible. My socks made it a little slippery but at least I wasn’t leaving any tracks from my shoes.


“Why does he want it done tonight?” I heard a door open from below. Going up three steps, I slipped into the shadow and didn’t move. Holding my breath, I continued on. “They aren’t going anywhere.”

“Not sure man, the last guy he cut up didn’t say a word. He was fucking pissed off.” My heart wanted to.start— pounding. My informant didn’t talk.

“Yeah but this guy is just a fucking roach that won’t die. I don’t think it will matter if he talks or not, he won’t see daylight.” Their voices got quieter and quieter.

They were going to be questioning Zac tonight. That made this even more important to find Gunther and get the fuck out. Moving quicker, I kept checking rooms. A few times, I saw someone in bed but it was either someone I didn’t recognize their smell or only had one person in there.

Going to the next hallway, I opened the first door and was about to close it


when I saw a little glimmer of a sparkling shoe. Figuring it wouldn’t be a maid or servant’s shoe, it would have to be Kara’s. Slipping in and shutting the door quietly, I was able to get up next to the bed.

The feeling of eyes on me was strong but as I looked around, I didn’t see any obvious cameras. Still, I knew they were there. “Please!” Kara’s whine came out as she turned over in her sleep. Sweat had covered her face and she was sporting a fresh busted lip. A little purple was starting to show up.

“Hurry up. Wake him up and tell him to take the damn pills and get out! I can see people starting to move around in the windows.” I heard in my ear.


Walking over to Gunther’s side, I put

my hand over his mouth. His eyes instantly opened and he became defensive. Dodging a left hook; I push my aura out on him and held my position.

As soon as he realized it was me, he became even more rigid but relaxed. noveldrama

“The fuck?” “Take these pills. Give these to Kara.” Shoving the pills in his hand, I took a few steps back.

“What? Why?” Gunther whispered. He looked over at Kara, who was still asleep and then stood up. “There are cameras and audio recordings.” He said so low that I barely missed it.

“Take them if you want to live.” I said simply and walked to the door.

Cracking it open, I slipped out and shut it behind me.

“Get to the dungeons. Should be | somewhere towards the back. There is a ton of movement.” One guy said | urgently.

“We only have so many eyes out so be careful.” Another guy said.

The only thing I could think of was if Blake was having any success. I very well could need a diversion and that would be a great one. Staying close to the wall, I tried to find my way down the hall while avoiding men.

As I turned the corner, I came face to face with a guard. It took a second for him to realize that I was not one of theirs and it took me a second to figure out that I was fucked



















###Chapter 0438

 Before either of us could respond, blood splattered the wall and his eyes glazed over. His body slumped forward, into my arms. Looking to the left, there was a tiny hole in the window.

There was a slight panic before I saw the door beside me. It was work opening the door without dropping him but I managed. It was a bathroom.

Trying to make it look like it was just occupied, I turned the fan on, locked the door and shut it.

“Clean up any blood.” I heard just as I was about to shut the door.

“Don’t fucking shoot them through the temple then.” I barked as I grabbed a towel, got it wet and peaked out from

-_y TN TviYe the bathroom. The coast was clear, allowing me to quickly clean the blood.

Tossing the towel into the bathroom, 1 made sure the bathroom was locked and left the room.

Following the noise, I made it to the stairs and paused. “We don’t have eyes down there.” I heard in my ear.

Looking over, the window was right there. As soon as I went beyond the door, I was alone. Looking around, there wasn’t anyone around me.

“Blake?” I whispered.


“No word yet.” Alec said. noveldrama

“TI might need a distraction.” I said, voicing my thoughts.

“We got you covered.” A guy said, a little too excited.


“Alec, you remember what we talked

about...” I looked out the window. | wasn’t sure it was Alec I was looking at but I found comfort in believing it was him.

“You can tell her yourself when you make it out.” Alec replied with a thick voice.

Nodding in understanding, my hand wrapped around the door handle. After taking a deep breath, the door opened and I slipped in. Complete darkness eloped me. The sound of flesh hitting flesh echoed down the hall. How the fuck was I going to get Zac out of here was unknown. There was a door to my left. Opening it, it was just another fucking closet with bleach and stained bloody rags. We all had closets like this but this one was rather small.

“Set off another alarm. Get the men

outside and I'll figure it out from there.” I whispered.

“Seriously? That will bring Vin out and make all the guards mobile.” Someone said over my ear.

“The other option is me killing all these fuckers and them knowing we are here. Neither option is good but if there is a chance I can do this without being noticed, the better.” “Colt..” Alec said.


“Do it, Alec.” I didn’t hear anything but about two minutes later, I heard another alarm sound.

“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH THE FUCKING ALARMS? WHERE IS PATRICK AND WHY ARE THEY MALFUNCTIONING!” I heard Vin stomp past me with multiple other

men fun either way. €» Only when a whole minute went byand there wasn’t another man going by, then I decided it was clear. Opening the closet, there wasn’t anyone in sight.

Moving quickly, I pulled out my knife was I came up to a room with an open door and bright light.

“Fuck you.” I heard a very tired Zac growl.

“You're the dead man.” I assumed a guard said as he laughed. Peaking around the room, Zac was looking down. Tied to a chair, his face and body was bloody. His shirt was off and there was carvings in his skin. I couldn’t see exactly what it said but there was only one guard. His back was towards me.

Pubfuture Ads
Making a quick attack, without thinking, I just leaped forward. The

guard turned around just in time to see me coming with a knife. He couldn’t get a thought out before the knife plunged into his neck. Not wanting him to mind-link anyone. My hands wrapped around his head, snapping it clean. His body fell to the ground as a pool of blood decorated the floor.

“Colt?” Zac looked shocked and confused.

“Do you know how to get out of here?” I asked. Going behind him, I cut the rope off his hands and legs. His body fell forward but I didn’t have time to him to be weak. “Alec, it would be a great time for Blake to show up.” I said as I heaved Zac up by the arm.

“Damn! That hurts!” Zac groaned.


“Don’t give a fuck. Get up or we are both dead.” I growled back. That did

Sy "9 BONUS the trick as Zac somehow gathered the strength and got to his feet.

“You're in luck.” Alec said, clearly relieved. Pulling Zac’s arm around me, I half carried him in the opposite direction than I came in. It was a long hallway until there was a back door.

“I’m at the back door.” I told Alec.

“Hold position.” I heard. There was no stopping my adrenaline from pumping now. My heart was going and it was all I could do to stop the panic from rising.

“Now! Get in the woods!” “Move!” I said to Zac as I opened the door. Basically, throwing him out the door, we made a mad dash to the tree line. A small wolf was waiting for us.

He got down and I tossed Zac on his back. When he stood up, he looked at i;

me.

“Get back to the base. I'm running.” 1 said and we took off. I could hear the pack of wolves setting off every alarm possible, making it a nightmare. “Did we get the poison in the air conditioner?” I asked as I ran.

“Yeah, Blake got it. That’s why I had you holding till he was in position to get Zac.” “Alright boys, start picking them off.” Alec said. I didn’t have the pleasure of watching the men fall but after thirty seconds, I heard them scream.

“Get inside the castle!” By the time we made it back to the base, the yelling had stopped and they had turned on their own self-defense systems. |

wy VY VTwWe “Did we get Vin?” | asked, praying to the Moon Goddess someone managed to kill him. =















###Chapter 0439 

“No. He never made it outside from what I saw.” Alec said as he took a shot.

“How did you find us?” Zac asked. His voice was thick with pain. His breathing was heavy and a layer of sweat had formed on his skin.

Ignoring him, I grabbed the binoculars and looked around. Men were coming out of the castle with blood seeping out of their eyes, nose and mouth. “This is working good.” I said, feeling a little hopefulness.

“Gunther and Kara are bleeding but not coughing like the rest.” Alec reported.

“Eyes on Vin. He ran into the woods

with a group of men. No eyes on him.” “Are you going after him?” Zac asked. noveldrama

“Gunther and Kara took off after him.” The same guy reported.

Alec looked at me. “Hold positions.

Finish off our task here.” Closing my eyes, I just listened to Alec’s gun go off a few more times before he sat up. “It was the right call.” “You let him get away.” Zac had a bitterness to him.

“Why the fuck are you even here?” I rounded on him. “We had a fucking plan and you royally fucked it up! Why can’t you just fucking stay in the shadow and not get caught?” I tried

SRE Ea a tr not yell but damn it was hard.

“I'had some intel. Didn't count on Vin’s men being there.” Zac looked away from me.

“Intel on what?” “There was some girls that were being sold. They used to be maids for Vin and I thought they might have some intel on his operations.” “Let’s pack it up and go home.” Alec said to his


“When is the next auction?” I asked Zac.

“Not for another few weeks. After this, might be a long time before they do anything public. Might just stick to private interactions. This was a major punch to Vin’s gut. He won't let this go.

This just costed him his reputation.”

Zac looked at me and meant every word.

“He shouldn’t have the man power to retaliate just yet. This would have taken him months to build.” Alec chimed in.

“Don’t get comfortable. He has allies and could call on them to issue an attack to your packs.” Zac looked at us like we didn’t take him seriously.

“With our size, he has enough allies to think they stand a chance?” I asked.

“You pissed a lot of alphas off by killing Rip. They might team up with Vin to kill you and then will probably turn and kill Vin after. No one likes Vin but they hate you more.” “The enemy of my enemy is my

NOME a ac friend.” Alec muttered as he kept packing his stuff up.

“Exactly.” a “That’s not a bad thing. Just fucking attack and we can battle this out. No more of this sneaking around shit.” I wanted this over and if a battle was coming and bring it on.

“Only a handful of men made it into the woods.” I heard from behind me as the men started coming back.

Grabbing my phone, I loaded the tracking and looked at them. They were running still, like they were being chanced. Zac was too busy watching everyone pack up that he didn’t pay attention to my phone. Still, I closed it and put it in my pocket. My feet were getting a little chilly from not having shoes but it is what it was. &9 E.


WY TIS BON “Where are your shoes, Alpha Colt?” Blake asked me as he shifted back into his human form. Sie “Had to take them off. Tracking dirt and leaving a trail.” “I can shift back...” Blake offered, awkwardly.

“I can shift too if needed but thanks.” Sighing, I grabbed the rest of my shit and started off towards the car.

“Little help here!” Zac yelled at me.

Feeling somewhat annoyed by him still, I grabbed his arm and yanked him up. “Better?” Watching him grimace in pain, he just scowled but kept going.

“How many lives do you have left, Zac?” Alec asked as he came up beside

SW 710 BONU us. Probably to make sure | didn’t just kill him myself, “Few more. I ain’t done yet.” Zac had some places reopen and was bleeding again. Still, my sympathy was extremely low.

“Stop talking, Zac. If you would have just fucking killed Rip when Cassie found Rip, none of this would have happened. Did you even fucking try to kill him over the years?” I knew I was projecting my own anger onto him but that didn’t mean I was exactly wrong.

No one said a word, not even Zac as we continued the rest of our walk back to the vehicle. Shoving him in the back, we got in. The sun was starting to rise and we were all exhausted. Still, I forced myself to stay awake with Alec.

+15 BONL The rest of the car was passed out, Their snoring was louder than any music we could play. The worst part, none of it was in sync with the others SO as soon as one stopped another would start. He would be half done with another would start. This is how it went for the entire way.

“You can sleep.” Alec sighed.

“I'm good.” “Where are they?” Alec asked. We were only a few hours from home at this point.

“Still walking in the woods. Headed East.” “Unless they go back and look, he i ize it was us until later.” might not realize it w.

Alec sounded hopeful.

“That would require more luck than | think I have.” That would be nice for Vin to believe Zac did something but I doubted he was that stupid.

“Yeah. We need to assume he knows it was us.” : “We should really bomb that place.

Keep him from going back and looking at any footage. Anyone there is dead so now it’s time to flatten it.” “Yeah, I would have to agree. Maybe that will prolong them from tracking, They could think it was someone he fucked over from a deal.” Alec suggested.

“The biggest question is if he will call in his allies and exactly how much support will he be able to get?”





















###Chapter 0440 

“Colt, you have been staring at that screen for two weeks now.” Penny placed her hands on my shoulders. It has been two weeks since we visited Vin. For two weeks, my eyes felt like they haven't left the tracking screen.

Gunther and Kara have been stationary at an abandoned houses in the middle of the woods. Never once leaving there. noveldrama

There was no way of us knowing if Vin was coming and going and without just showing up, we had to act like we had no idea where they were at. It was already risky that we showed up at the castle.

“I know. I'm not sure what I am looking for but I can’t seem to look away.”

“Has there been any word on I movement with the auctions?” Penny asked. She waddled over to the sofa and sat down. Her belly was really rounding out. She was at the point in her pregnancy that women with one baby felt like at 40 weeks. Still, she was being a trouper. Since her blood pressure was staying within the normal range, she has been able to keep doing whatever she wants.

However, at the end of the day, her ankles are pretty swollen. €5 “Some whispers but nothing that was concrete. Zac claims he is healed and ready to go back out there. At this point, I don’t think that is a good idea.

He has used up most of his lives and I might not be there a third time to save his ass.” Sighing, I turned off the tracker and leaned back in my chair.

“I doubt you are going to stop him, either way.” Penny was rubbing her belly with both hands.

“The Halloween party is getting closer.

Are we ready for it?” I asked, changing the subject as that one has been the center of our lives.


“Oh yeah. We are good to go. Food will be arriving soon and all the decorations arrived yesterday.” Penny's face lit up.

“Decide on a costume?” “I think I am going to go as the Moon Goddess. That will be simple, comfortable and easy to put together.” “Good.”

Bp TAA dad “What about you?” Penny looked at me with a raised eyebrow.

“Do you have something in mind you want me to go as?” I asked, trying to read her expression.

“Father time.” Not that it sounded appealing but I didn’t care enough to go against whatever she wanted. “Sure, if that is what you want me to go as.” “You don’t have to.” Penny frowned at me.

“T just don’t want to wear a beard like that.” If I remembered correctly, he had a long gray beard with robes. I was okay with the robes and a large clock hanging down my neck but I'll drawl the line at the beard.” “Ha!” Penny laughed as the door

opened and Alec walked in.

“Did I interrupt?” He looked at Penny with a little amusement. ig We never really told Penny what danger I was in. Obviously, we told her what happened and everything but left out the sheer danger I put myself into.

Not even mentioning what I asked of Alec. That will be an unspoken thing that Alec will take to his grave.

“No. Colt doesn’t want to wear a long gray beard for Halloween.” Alec looked at me. “Would you want to wear it?” I asked in self defense.

“Shit. Kristen wants to dress up as a disco ball and wants me to dress up in 70’s attire. Afro and all.” “Suddenly, a beard doesn’t sound bad at all.” I said, smirking at his expense.


“I said no fro but the rest was fine.” He took a seat and sighed. Ee “I’m sure she already bought you the costume and forgot to tell you.” I placed air quotes around forgot and Alec nodded in response. @ “We just knew you boys were busy and we walked to make sure you had an option. That way, if you didn’t have time to find one before the party, we had you covered.” Penny said as she struggled to stand up. Alec jumped up before I could and gave her a hand.

“Thank you.” “Where are you going?” I asked.

“Lay down. The Chinese I had for lunch is making me swell. I am ready to go home and let you boys talk shop.”

“Do you need a ride or do you have someone to drive you?” I asked.

“I’m good. I have the golf cart and Tl be fine. I'm hoping the belly support band I bought came in the mail.” Penny walked over to the door.

“Be safe. Let me know when you get home.” I said, watching her move. It was such a bitter sweet thing. Part of me felt sorry for her. Her body was changing before our eyes, the swelling and constant peeing was taking a toll on her. However, she never complained. On the other side, I felt so much love and gratitude towards her for carrying my children. Not just one but three babies. She looked sexy doing it. As long as her blood pressure stayed down, we were going to make it decently far.

“Will do! Bye!” Penny waved as she walked out and shut the door.

“She looks uncomfortable.” Alec said as soon as he was sure she was out of ear shot.

“How’s Ice?” I asked.

“She is loving being pregnant. Other than no drinking, she has really felt good and loves showing off her bump.

The shop is going great, too.” Alec shrugged as he placed some papers on my desk.

“What's this?” “T caught more whispering of another event coming up. They aren’t selling girls. I'm not actually sure what they are selling but word is all the major players will be there.” “If Vin wanted to put some feelers out

and see who is on his side still, he might be there.” I started thinking out loud.

“We can really play this one of two ways.”












###Chapter 0441 

“Oh?” I asked, waiting to hear what he had to say.

“Crash it and let everyone know that you have ears everywhere, even without your informant...” “Or?” “Or stay in the shadows and see what you can hear. However, 1 did gather some information that might intrigue you.” Alec got a weird glimmer in his eye.

“What?” I asked, suspiciously.

“The old man that lives there. He hates Vin. Rip funded his operation so the old man turned a blind eye and did favors for Rip. Since Rip was killed, Vin hasn't paid him, It might be worth our while

to pay him a visit with a check and see what we can do.” “That’s.... an idea.” I stewed over it for awhile before I spoke again. “We could give him money and he could betray us or give us wrong information.” “True. He could take our money and not want to work with us since he has spent his life around everything illegal.” Alec agreed. “However.” He leaned forward. “He could give us all the information we are missing.” “1 mean, we could pay him a visit and see what he has to say.” I felt a little uneasy about this.

“If we did, we couldn’t use the quiet, shadow approach. Our cover would be blown.” “What’s even worse, if we did approach him and he said he would

help us. We get to whatever event is going on and then he announces who we are. There isn’t another way. out. We would be dead.” I stressed. “I gota look of that place when I approached Gunther. Plus, I had my hand around his neck. He wasn’t exactly a fan of me.” “Money changes a person.” Alec gave me a look as he said it. He wasn’t wrong. Money does change a person.

Changes their motives and changes their attitude towards a situation.

“It’s not like we can send Zac anywhere and Gunther and Kara have been hiding in some cabin. We are running out of tricks to see but I would like to figure out what he has to say.” “That might be our next move. See

what Gunther thinks.” Alec agreed.


“You said he slept at the old man’s house. Maybe Gunther will be able to gage on if he would work with us or not.” “We would have to see if Vin is around or watching.” “We could send that pack of wolves.

Blake has been with them since a few days ago. He doesn’t have a family and I'was thinking he would be good to have undercover in case we needed something.” “That would be helpful. Blake could give him a message or figure out the best way to communicate with Gunther.” I was surprised he sent Blake to live with the pack of wolves but it made sense.

“The only problem with that. If Vin

recognized them, that wouldn’t be good.” Alec said.

“That is assuming Vin has enough man power to do anything about it.” “They ran to that cabin with no hesitation. Other than the helicopter we sent to look at it, we don’t have eyes. Who knows what security he has.” Alec didn’t sound too sure himself.

“Think about it. Kristen wants to go to your house for supper. She doesn’t Penny isn’t going to cook so she is wanting to bring something with us for everyone.” @ “Is everything okay?” I asked.

“Oh yeah. I think she just misses you honestly. You have been so busy with things that you haven't spent time

with Kristen and she is missing her twin.” “Look at her heart showing.” 1 ~~ laughed.

“She has been a little more emotional ~ butshe does have something she wants to talk to you about.” “Emotional like Emmy?” I asked. noveldrama

“Fuck no. Nothing like that.” “What does she want to talk to me about?” I asked, unsure of this supper.

“That’s between you and her. My only job was to tell you that we are coming.” Alec held up his hands.

“Thanks for the warning.” I said, dully.

“Anytime.” Alec smirked as he stood up. “I'm going home to tell her I | delivered the message. We wiil see you | at six.” “Okay. See you then.” Alec nodded and walked out.

Deciding I might as well go break the news to Penny, I stood up and walked out of my office. The packhouse was busy. People were coming and going and the warriors were all on high alert.

Since the attack on Vin, I have expected an attack in retaliation but so far, Vin has been quiet.

Getting into my car, I was able to make it home in complete silence. Just looking at the house, I was filled with happiness. Raising my kids here meant everything to me.

“Penny?” I asked as I walked in the

front door.

“I’m here!” Penny yelled from the ; kitchen. pe “What are you doing?” I asked as I walked into the kitchen. She was looking in the fridge, while holding an opened jar of pickles. As she looked, she kept picking one out and eating it.

“Looking for something for supper.” She didn’t even look over at me.

“Kristen wants to bring supper over for us. She has something she wants to talk to us about.” “Oh? What's that?” Penny sighed and shut the door.

“Alec didn’t say.” Grabbing a pickle, I ate it as she walked to the livingroom.

“I think I have an idea of what it might be about.” Penny looked at me and sat down.

“What's that?”

offer. "There's no need to trouble you further. I'll take this one. It's perfect," she said, her voice tight with emotion.

Rose observed Clarissa's tension with a pang of sadness. "Ready-made garments may not offer the same fit as bespoke ones. There might be some adjustments needed. I recommend trying it on in the fitting room for the best result. If alterations are necessary, I'll take care of it." Clarissa hesitated briefly before she walked into the fitting room. 9

Chapter 0442 “I’m guessing the Halloween party. We have been discussing costumes and food.” “Alec said she wants them to go a disco ball and a 70s person.” I looked at her to gage her reaction.

Penny tossed her head back and laughed. “Tloved that idea. It was by far one of the better ones she tossed out there.” “What else did she want?” I asked.

“Either she was going to be the volleyball from Castaway and make him Tom Hanks or be Juno.” “Those are horrible ideas.” Shaking my head, we walked back to the livingroom and sat down.

“There was some more sexual ones but we all decided to go as sornething funny.” Penny had made the recliners | hers. There was pillows lining it all the edges. Cups and snacks were piled neatly on the end table and her computer was within arms reach.

“The Moon Goddess was funny?” I asked turning on the T.V.

“Better than the gumball machine she wanted me to be.” Penny pulled up a blanket as Friends started playing. By the time I looked over at the next commercial, she was passed out.

Wanting to be helpful, I got up and picked up the livingroom, did the dishes and got the laundry rotated.

There was some cleaning stuff out so | went ahead and cleaned the bathrooms. I had just finished folding

the blankets when the doorbell rang.

“What?” Penny shot up, looking confused.

“Looks like Alec and Ice are here.” I tried to hide my laughter as I opened the door.

“Hey!” Ice smiled as she came in. Alec was holding a few different bags and took them straight to the kitchen.

Pubfuture Ads
“Oh no! I was going to do some cleaning before you got here.” Penny frowned.

“Already did it.” I said as I went into the kitchen with Alec.

“You can come do my house next.” Ice laughed as the girls came in.

“The builders have finished putting in

all the cabinets and shit. Our hour is a giant dust collection.” Alec was pulling the food out. He placed two salads in front of the girls and him and I each got a steak.

“I can’t wait to see it!” Penny looked excited. “I'm surprised you managed to do it all by yourself. Usually, I have to do it all for you.” “Hey!” Ice faked looking hurt. I was mid way into a beer and choked on it.

Beer came out my nose, making my eyes water.

“She isn’t wrong.” I laughed as I cleaned my face.

“If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have even made it to fifteen years old.” Penny opened her salad and took a bite.

“Send your ass back to the orphanage.” Ice grumbled. “I did some stuff!” Gi | “You did. You gave me all the information and I organized, created a plan and submitted it. Then I did the followup checks and daily set ups.” Penny looked at Ice like she dared her to argue.

“Whatever. I was running my own shop.” “Speaking of which, I am going to need a tattoo once our babies are born.” I said to her.

“What are you going to get?” Ice asked, eagerly. noveldrama

“I'was thinking about their footprints down my arm or something.” “With three of them, that would be |

really cute.” Ice agreed.

“Yeah, that is what I am going for....cute.” Rolling my eyes, I just finished my beer off and got started on my food.

“Alec said you have something you wanted to discuss with us?” Penny asked after we were quiet for awhile.

“Yeah so.... we found out we are having agirl.” “That’s so exciting!” Penny’s eyes got wide as she smiled.

“Thank you. We wanted to have a handful of kids so Alec will have another chance for a boy.” “Hey! Girls are just as capable as men.” Penny pointed her fork at him.

“I know that but I'm not going to raise my daughter like Kristen was raised. If she wants to fight, that will be her choice. If she wants to be a princess and get pampered, that’s okay too.” Part of me was a little put off by that but I understood where he was coming from. Ice didn’t have the best upbringing and had very little choice on her life. He wanted to make sure his daughter was given the options her mother didn’t have.

“So, what is the question?” I asked.

“Well, I was wanting to see if you guys have talked about baby names? We were discussing some and [ was thinking about naming our daughter, | Adalynn.”

That surprised me a little. We have talked about baby name some but nothing more than a few suggestions: Putting another bite in my mouth, I just looked at Ice. Alec and Penny didn’t say anything but watched us. Ice was clearly nervous but I wasn’t sure why.

“Why are you so nervous?” I finally asked.

“I’m not nervous!” She rolled her eyes and looked away from me.

“I can see it all over your face.” I said, calling her out on her bullshit.

“I just didn’t know if you wanted to name your daughter after our mother.” “I'haven’t really put much thought into baby names. I’ve been busy doing

other things.” “Well, you should. Your babies will be here sooner than later and since there are three, you need to be ready.” Ice gave me a pointed look.

“I’m trying to make sure the world is a safer place and their mother isn’t in danger.” I challenged her back.

“We really have only thrown names out there but we haven’t had a serious conversation about what to name them.” Penny said, trying to defuse any tension.

“Ice, if you want to name your daughter Adalynn, that’s fine by me.” I tried to sound as neutral as possible.

“Are you sure? We can look at other names.” Ice looked at me uneasily.

“I’m sure. Adalynn what?” I asked.

“Adalynn Grace.” y—










###Chapter 0443 “

I really like that.” Penny said, enthusiastically.

“It was just a thought. We haven't decided really but I didn’t want to officially decide on it until I talked to you.” Ice was looking at me, hoping for some reaction.

“Whatever you call her, I'll be spoiling her rotten so it doesn’t really matter.” I tried to sound like it didn’t bother me but there was a little nagging voice in the back of my head that told me it really did bother me. Not sure why. It wasn’t like we already decided on names. We talked about it once and that was it.

Getting up, I grabbed two more beers and set one in front of Alec. After

opening mine, I took a long drink as Penny, thankfully, changed the subject. “I got some fabric from the store and I’m going to need help designing the goddess dress.” “Oh! 1 would love to help. We can either cut a whole in a dress for your stomach and just wrap the white fabric around it or just make a dress out of the fabric.” “I like the idea of cutting a whole. We can go shopping for a white dress or I can order one.” Penny acted relieved but kept looking at me and smiling.

“I need to buy Alec some 70s clothes too.” Ice kept looking at me too and it was getting annoying. Since we were done eating, I started cleaning up. noveldrama

“Colt needs some robes. Maybe we can go shopping this week. Halloween isn’t

far off and our chances to go are very limited.” Penny pointed out.

«Prue. We really need to get going.” Ice agreed.

Alec got my attention and nodded to the front door. Following him out as the girls talked, I sat on the porch swing and he leaned against the pillar.

“Here.” He offered me another beer.

“Thanks.” I said. Downing the one I had, I was able to open the other one and take a sip before he started talking.

“We don’t have to name our daughter that.” Alec started.

| Waving him off, I just shook my head.

“It just caught me by surprise. We | haven’t discussed names. My attention


has been on Vin, not baby names.” “you have three to name. Not just one.

Plus, making a child is big. Needs to be fierce.” “Come out here to plead your mate’s wishes?” I asked with a little bit of attitude.

“No. Blake got back to me this afternoon. There is another event tomorrow. If we want to finance the old man, we need to move.” “What about Vin?” I asked, intrigued.

“Rumors say he isn’t going to show up.” Alec looked at me.

“Do you think this is our best play?” I asked. Taking a long sip from my beer, I weighed our options. We didn’t have many choices and sitting back, waiting

for an attack or for Vin to get stronger didn’t feel like a great option.

“There isn’t one but if we did nothing, Vin will only get stronger.” Alec said, mirroring my thoughts.

“Just thinking that. Let go and see what he has to say.” I finished speaking when the girls came out.

Penny sat beside me on the swing and Ice took a chair.

“What are you boys talking about?” Penny asked.

“We are going to go on another trip.” Alec said, simply.

“You have been gone a lot.” Ice said.

“Do you want us to get Vin?” I asked, a little annoyed.

“That isn’t what she meant.” Penny put her hand on my knee. “Every time you guys leave, we are just worried you won’t come back.” “If we don’t leave, the fight comes here and that means more death.” I said. Draping my arm around her, she snuggled against me. Kissing her forehead, I tried to push reassuring feelings into her.

“If the event is tomorrow, we should really leave tonight.” Alec said, slightly unsure.


“Yeah, we can make it by there in the morning.” “At this rate, you guys should rent an apartment there.” Ice half joked.

“Nope, you need to come home. Who knows when I will have these babies.”

Penny instantly got concerned.

“1’1l never miss the delivery.” Putting my hand on her stomach, I just felt my little guys fight it out.

“However, we do need to leave tonight.

Maybe gone a day or two.” “Might as well stay and watch the auction. Take the guys with you?” Ice said.

“Probably. Little extra cover and maybe put someone on the inside.” Alec agreed.

“Well, then I guess we should get going so you can pack.” Ice stood up.

“Thank you for bring over supper!” Penny smiled at them.

“Of course. It was nice talking to you

all.” Ice looked at me as we stood up.

“Take care. Better give my niece some candy when you get home.” I said and gave her a smile.

“Is that what kind of uncle you are going to be?” “Obviously.” I just shrugged as Alec helped her down the stairs and into their car.

“I’m ready for this to be over so you don’t have to leave anymore.” Penny said as we made our way inside.

“You and me both.” We made our way to the bedroom for me to start pulling out all the clothes I had just put away the week before. “I guess you can think of baby names on

your way down there.” “Coming up with one name is hard enough. Now we got to think of three.” “All the baby stuff we ordered should be in soon.” Penny sat down on the rocking chair.

“Oh good. We should be back in time for me to put it all together.” “Thank for cleaning the house for me.” Penny said as I finished packing my bag.

“Of course. You really shouldn’t be doing that stuff anyway. I'll take care of it.” I said to Penny but my mind was already on the task at hand.












###Chapter 0444 

“Boys ready?” Alec asked as he got into the passenger’s seat.

“yes.” We wear a collection of yes and a few just grunts from the back. They were happy to come along as the men had fun last time but riding in this SUV for this long is not idea.

“Good. You boys have a few hours to help Alpha Colt come up with baby names.” Alec said. My head snapped him his in shock.

“The fuck did my sister do to you?” I asked. That earned many chuckles from the back.

“you didn’t exactly respond favorably earlier so now she has it in her mind that we need to help you.” Alec said as

he pulled out a piece of paper.

«Is that a list of names?” I asked. noveldrama

“yes.” Alec started to read the first one but I grabbed it from his hand and tossed it out of the window.

“Hey! » “Tell my sister to kiss my ass.” Sighing, I knew this was going to be a long car ride.

“Waylon is a good name.” I heard from the back. “My mate and I were going to use that name but we only had girls.” “Wesley is good.” “Wesley is a pretty boys name. Not a name for an Alpha.” I groaned. Alec was just silently laughing at my misery.

“Archer Brian.” I heard from the back.

“That’s not a bad name.” Another guy noted.

“Anton.” “Yeah, if you want him to get picked on at school.” The men in the back were starting to argue about what names are better than the rest. I honestly liked Archer Brian. It wasn’t terrible.


“Grayson.” I heard them say. That was another one that caught my attention.

It wasn’t so unknown that made it weird but it was still not common that he will run into many other Graysons.

“How about we discuss something else.” I suggested but in a more firm voice.

They changed their conversation but I let it drift into background noise.

Instead, I just kept thinking about the stress of it all. Nothing was making me happier than to be getting three babies here soon. However, the stress of knowing my heavily pregnant mate was in imminent danger was giving me narrow vision. As much as I wanted to meet my children and name them, I wanted it to be in a world that was safe.

Thinking of baby names right now seemed impractical.

I needed to focus on how to kill Vin and take down whatever thing he was building. Only when he was dead, would my mate and children be safe.

Allowing them come into a world with Vin still alive wasn’t an option.

After stopping for food, we managed to make it to our destination. Since I had

drove through the night, it was only an hour or so before the sun came up.

Knowing the men wanted a few hours of shut eye, I pulled into a hotel.

Alec got rooms for everyone. As they paired up, they went into their rooms and shut the door. “What are you doing?” Alec asked.

“Going to go visit the old man.” I responded. There was no way in hell I would be able to sleep right now.


“Now?” “I don’t want to visit him in the day time and tonight is the event.

Whatever event that is, I rather not cut it close. At least, this way, we can set up and not worry about approaching until the time is right.” “Let me get my shoes on.” Alec sighed.

Picking up my wallet, I just looked at { him. “You don’t have to go.” All he did was roll his eyes at me.

Turning, I just walked out of the room and got into the drivers seat. Alec was only a few steps behind me as he got in the passengers seat.

Taking a deep breath, Alec just got comfortable. “Ready to go.” “Wonderful.” Putting the vehicle in reverse, we backed up and got back on the road.

“What’s your plan?” Looking over, Alec had set his phone down and looked at me. “Not really sure. Walk up to him and offer him money for information.”

“simple enough.” “Let’s just hope it works.” The rest of the drive was silent. Even as we pulled up to a different outskirts of the forest, we were quiet. Not once did Alec try to speak to me, which was just alright with me.

A single, small line of smoke rose above the trees. Alec climbed a tree.

Looking up, I waited for him to give me the signal. He had his binoculars and other fancy tools to help him asses the situation without actually being there.

Once he gave me the signal, I started my journey. The night life was starting to quiet down as the morning life was starting to stir. As I got closer to the stack, I saw some movement in the window. This was going to make it

trickier but I had to make the best out of it. ) Staying right in the tree line, I watched the movement. It seemed he was making some coffee or tea. Thankfully, he hadn’t turned any lights on or maybe he didn’t have the capability to turn the lights on.

I saw my opportunity as he walked out of the kitchen and into the back of the room. Quickly moving to the back door, my eyes kept shifting around for any signs of danger.

My hand was bone dry as I grabbed the handle and slowly turned it. Slipping in, I closed it quickly and sat down at the table. Since it was still dark, only the moonlight showed just my foot, intentionally.

Slowly, the old man limped back into

the kitchen. Keeping my breathing shallow, I waited until he turned and J sat my foot. The coffee pot fell to the ground, shattering.

«W-who are you?” He asked. There was some fear but mostly anger.

“We already met.” I said, leaning forward, I allowed him to see my face.



















###Chapter 0445 

The old man squinted at me before recognition spread across his face.

“The fuck do you want?” He asked before sitting down. With no coffee to hold, his hands kept fidgeting around.

“Just wanted to have a little chat with you.” “Last time you wanted to chat, your hands cut off my air supply.” He grumbled a few thing that I didn’t catch but I could assume what the gist of it was.

“You can understand someone in my position might need to use....

unfavorable tactics to achieve a certain outcome.”

“Go blow your shit up someone else’s ass.” He waved me off as he got up and limped to his cabinets. Pulling out a tee bag, he filled a dirty mug with some brown water before putting the tea bag in it. His immune system must be Strong. €9 “It has been brought to my attention that you are running out of money. Vin isn’t supplying you anymore and now you are feeling it.” To give the old man credit, he barely even flinched but his eyes gave him away. “Rumors.” “Just because they are rumors, doesn’t make it false.” Leaning forward, I pulled out my wallet. Grabbing a hundred, I tossed it over to him.

“There is more where that came from.”

“Why the fuck do I want your money?” His eyes lingered on it but he just sat back and didn’t touch it. .

“You need it. This place is going out of business and by the looks of it, you don’t even have electricity.” He grumbled and huffed. “How do you even know that?” He asked like it wasn’t obvious.

“Is that a serious question? Your light switches are all on. You heated up your coffee over an open flame and now you are drinking cold tea. Probably since that is a caffeine tea, you will be struggling today. Let’s have a serious discussion.” “What do you want?” “Information.” The old man leaned back and tried to

put his bad leg over his good leg but winced and put it back down. Then he moved so he was sitting more upright but decided against it and sat back again. “What kind of information?” “Have you ever heard of the phrase, ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’?” I asked.

“Who's our enemy?” He asked, glancing over at me.

“Vin.” Ilooked at him like he was stupid. “We both know I want Vin fucking dead yesterday. Since Rip died, you haven’t been getting paid.

Knowing Vin and by the looks of things, you aren’t getting paid. I think we both would benefit if Vin was removed from the equation. My family is safe and you can continue to do

whatever it is your heart desires.” “I don’t have information on Vin.” | It was the old man’s turn to look at me like I was stupid. “You're lying.” I said simply.

“How so?” Slamming his cup down, cold tea spilled everywhere but neither of us flinched. For starters, it was cold tea and second, neither of us cared.

“You know Gunther. Gunther is his right hand man. I'm sure he has told you something and I’m sure there has been talk. Someone like you doesn’t closes his ears to the noise around him.” “You want me to double dip.” “Call it what you want but I only want Vin. My soul purpose is to kill him, otherwise I wouldn’t be here. Now, |

can do that with or without your help.

If Ido it without, I'll take this place down with him. If you don’t believe me, ask Rip what I am capable of. If you work with me, you get to keep this hell whole and make some money off it.” “What about after?” “After what?” He stood up and limped over to the windows and looked out. The sun was starting to peak through the trees and my time was running out. “The offer is not an outstanding thing. You either

“I'll see you tonight.” I said before | stood up. My body towered over him as I reached for the door. - “Tonight?” Looking back, he was gauging my reaction.

“I'll be watching. You won’t see me, hear me or even feel me but I'll always be watching your every move.

Especially, if you decline my offer.” Not giving him a chance to respond, I opened the door and ran out of the house. Everything in me told me it was time to go. My extra sense was ringing and that was something I didn’t listen to. Even my wolf was feeling agitated.

From the corner of my eye, I saw some movement. noveldrama

Pausing... another flash of something small and brown ran past the trees. It

wasn’t until a small brown wolf stopped and made eye contact with me did I realize what it was. Blake. They made it to the show.

As I reached Alec, he was getting down from the tree. “Some players just showed up. You got out right in the nick of time. I about had Blake get you out.” “Thad a feeling it was time to go.” I whispered as Alec was finishing something up. “What are you doing?” “Putting up a camera.” “It will be able to see his house from here?” I asked, a little taken aback.

“No but it will span this area. This is where Gunther came in last time so maybe we can identify some

characters. Later tonight we can install more.” The feeling was still nagging me. My wolf was pacing in my head, waiting for something to happen. “We need to go.” I said urgently.

“Yeah.” Alec looked around before tossing up the end of the cord. “Let’s go.” This time, Alec and I sprinted back to the vehicle. Not wanting to get caugh but what made our hair stand up was the sounds of wolves growling.














###Chapter 0446 

“Blake just mind-linked me. There was some new players.” Alec had an edge to his voice that I didn’t quite like.

Trying to stay as quiet as possible, I didn’t ask any questions until we came upon our vehicle. By the look of Alec, I could tell he was anxious. Whatever Blake had told him, it wasn’t good.

“What’s going on?” I finally asked when we got into the front seats.

“TIdon’t...” Alec shook his head in confusion.

What could be worse? “We are literally the most powerful Alphas on this continent. Who would cause this kind of reaction from Blake?” Alec looked at me, his hand running

through his hair. “Sir joe Gambino.” “The Russian Mafia Boss?” Alec nodded his head. “Exactly.” “He’s human.” I was so confused.

“No, he’s not. Blake said he could smell his wolf right away. His closer bodyguards are all wolves.” “Seriously? He is a wolf that runs the largest Russian organization? He poses as a human.” “I know. That’s probably why he has been left alone. For him to come over here and out himself as a wolf puts a huge target on his back.” Alec stared blankly out the window.

“I wonder if the other alphas didn’t want to side with him.” I speculated.

Putting the car in drive, I drove back to | the hotel. Alec watched the screen and was writing down each person he saw and taking screen shots, “Where are Gunther and Kara?” He asked me after we got back into our room.

Grabbing my phone, I pulled up the tracking device and looked at it. “Still at the cabin.” Alec glanced over at me. “Might have someone check on them tonight. I have a feeling that Vin will show up on Joe’s arm tonight. Flaunting his company.” “Not a bad idea.” This changed everything. The carpet was wearing thin with how much I was pacing. Alec was going to town on his phone still and neither of us got any sleep.

“I'honestly don’t know.” Shaking my head, I was just trying to figure out how we were going to go about this.

“Not really. We have a new player and it isn’t good” “Got it. Anything else?” Looking at Alec, I asked. “Was it Ben that did the dumpster diving for Ice?” “It was.” Alec confirmed without ~~

“Jacob, get Ben on looking everything he can about Sir. Joe Gambino.” “The mafia guy?” Jacob was a little taken aback. There was a small pause before he pieced it together.

“Fuck.” “Yeah. Any known residence in the U.S and just really anything on him.” “I'mean, he’s a human...” “No, he’s not.” There was a long pregnant pause before Jacob responded. “Damn. On it.” He hung up the phone.

Alec stood up and was looking at his phone as he walked to the door. “I'm going to call your sister. I'll be right back.” He said before closing the door behind him. His phone was already to his ear. Using the privacy, I dialed Penny’s number.

“Hey. How’s it going?” Her sweet voice sent shivers down my spine.

“Not great. Listen, I need you to set up camp in the packhouse. I might just being over protective and anxious but until I get more information, I would

“Okay. I love you and sleep good.” “Love you too.” I said as I yawned.

“...and Colt?” Penny’s voice sounded really emotional.

“Yeah?” “Please be careful.” “Always.” I said and we both hung up as Alec walked back into the room.

« i to tell you to Your sister wants me

Lo +15 BONUS sleep.” Alec rolled his eyes at what he said.

“You sure are being Ice’s little bitch lately.” Draping my arm over my eyes, I was ready to sleep.

“I'rather not deal with her emotional state if I don’t do what she asks.” Metal squeaking pierced my ears until he got comfortable.

“Hal Is she crying, making you feel bad?” I'had to hide a laughter.

Alec snorted. “No, she is extra bitchy. I always liked her fiery personality but pregnancy has magnified it.” “Can’t say I feel sorry for you.” It was out of my mouth and a second later, something soft hit me in the face.

“Go to sleep, we have to be ready in

###Chapter 0447 

“Alright men. You know your jobs.” Alec was looking at everyone.

“How do I look?” Mark was our top black ops person. Skilled in every skill he has learned and was the perfect person to go under cover. His mission was just to blend in and observe. His contact lenses doubled as a camera lense, allowing up to see what he saw.

Wearing a simple black blazer and a beanie, his beard was thick and his jeans were worn. Knowing how people dressed in there, he would blend in perfectly.

“Good. Better get going.” I urged him.

Alec checked the cameras and nodded.

“Let’s go.” We watched Mark walk into

the forest. The other men took their paths to find a secret location to observe everything.

I wanted nothing more than to be in that room tonight but we would have to deal with watching it through Mark’s eyes. Still, I didn’t like sending him in by himself but it would have been suspicious for him to have multiple people. The goal was to make it look like he might be with Sir Joe Gambino to the everyone else but put enough distance that to Joe, he was a normal person there.

“Check in.” Alec pulled up the computer and looked at everyone’s visuals.

Follow current on

Mark was still walking but had lit a cigar. We could see a few others pulling up from the headlights and there was

movement to his left. Voices were getting louder as he got closer and closer.

“In position.” I heard someone say. My attention to on Mark’s screen and not as much on the other men. Another screen popped up and it looked like it was through the scope of his sniper. It was pointed directly on Mark. From two different views, we watched Mark walk up behind someone in a large trench coat.

“Is audio on?” I asked. I wanted to hear everything.

“Hold on.” Alec messed with a few wires but suddenly, their voices filled my ears. noveldrama

«nice of you to join us this evening, I think you will thoroughly enjoy tonights events.” The old man’s voice

was a little shaky but so was he.

“I hope all the accommodations have been made that I requested.” My phone buzzed in my pocket.

Pulling it out, Jacob’s name flashed with a new message alert. Clicking it, I read it to myself. “Almost to the cabin now.” Putting my phone on the my leg with the screen open so I could see when a new message came through. “Jacob is almost there to check on Gunther and Kara.” “Sir Joe, please proceed down with your men. You will find adequate beverages being provided. The event will start soon.” Mark slipped behind the last man so perfectly. As the mafia people entered

the shed and walked down the stairs, Mark followed without any issues.

Follow current on novel-online.com

“Uncle! It is so good to see you!” My blood ran cold as Vin’s voice came across the mic. Vin made such a production about coming up to Sir Joe that everyone turned and looked.

Mark backed up and sat in a chair in the corner on the room. Three other men were just sitting there, watching this all play out. No one was talking or even moving really. Just watching this.

“Vin. It has been awhile.” Sr Joe looked at Vin with slight disappointment but accepted a hug.

“Come. I have secured a spot for you.” Vin lead them to a table directly in front of the cages.

The old man come down and shuts the door behind him. The lights went dim and a single light went on above the ring. “Show time.” Alec said.

“Mafia men generally respect women.


What event would this be?” I whispered more to myself than to anyone else.

I got any answer a second later. A table was brought out with a single chair.

Two men brought out a man in chains and tied him to the chair. Whoever the man was, he still had fight to him.

“What is this? What is going on?” He yelled. I had this nagging feeling in my stomach that he was human.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“Tonight, we have a different event scheduled.” Vin walked into the ring and started rolling up his sleeves.

“In honor of my uncle making this

trip, I have decided to display my current projects.” Vin’s reputation was on the line here so he was taking a large risk by showing this now. Some of the crowd I recognized and some I didn’t. Alec was busy taking screen shots as I studied everything I could.

“There has been rumors going around about myself and my ability to still produce is being questioned. With my uncle present, I want to show you all what I have been working tirelessly on.

What Darin and I had been working on until he death.” Vin paused as he pulled out a syringe.

“you see, Darin had a business of selling women. He would accumulate them and turn around and see to you.

However, what you didn’t know was

that he using them before he sold them.” There was a few that jumped up and yelled. Vin just stood there and calmly looked at them all. It wasn’t until the mafia guards stood up that they sat back down and shut up. It was clear they demanded respect.

“As I was saying.... let me clarify. Darin would take their blood for experimental purposes.” Vin was making this a whole show. Holding his hands together, he paced behind the chained man. “Together, him and I were working on something to change life as we know it. Experimenting with different drugs and then we started working with blood of ranking wolves.

It wasn’t until a little while ago that 1 finished our work. We have created a....potion of sorts.” Vin picked up the

syringe and waved it back and forth.

“This potion has the ability to give a human a wolf.” He put the needle into the man’s neck and pushed the red liquid into his neck.















###Chapter 0448 

“What?” I heard the men in my ear collectively ask. “Did we hear that right?” Alec and I didn’t respond as we watched in horror. The man screamed in agony. “While this takes affect, I am going to keep talking. This process takes a little bit of time to complete.” Vin snapped his fingers and the guards came out and placed tape over the guys mouth. His screams were muffled but it was easier to hear Vin.

Vin kept pacing around but looked at everyone as he talked. His eyes scanned the room, not really seeing anyone but making sure everyone felt addressed. “I have recently come into some ranking wolf’s blood. It is what

we used today but as you can see, it isn’t a perfect solution. After trials and errors, we have narrowed it down to what type of blood is needed and what kind of recipients is best to survive the transformation. Obviously, ranking wolf blood is the best blood as it has the strongest properties in it.

Awkwardly enough, female blood works better.” Vin held up his arms in acceptance.

The crowd did not like this. “Bullshit!” “Fuck off!” “Listen here!” Vin said, using his hands to help lower the volume, he kept going. “Women have a higher pain tolerance. It is a known fact. Just think about it. Not only are they constantly disciplined but they are

bending over cleaning, cooking or servicing us. They have their monthly cycles that I heard are painful and they are used to manual labor. We have used both men and women's blood and have found a higher success rate within the female category. Darin did a whole interviewing process. Moving them to rooms and tested their pain tolerances and even took some blood to test.” As he spoke, my mind went to the house. Ice was right. We weren't exactly wrong with what that how was for but we were way off. It all clicked.

Darin would draw them in. Interview them on their blood and probably still have his way with them. However, he wanted them for their blood. After he was done with them, he just sold them for a profit to he could keep running his business.

My phone buzzed slightly, making my eyes go there. Jacob texted back but what he said made me pick up my phone. “Gunther and Kara are gone.

Trackers were found and placed in some men.” Holding my phone up to Alec, he did a double take before looking at me. “He used Gunther’s blood.” I said.

“Kara doesn’t have any ranking blood, does she?” “No, her family is warriors.” “That's why they want Penny. She is an alpha female. Literally the strong female there is” Alec said. My eyes flipped back to the screen as Vin stepped back. The human was thrashing around. Nails were elongating, hair was sprouting out of his body and his eyes had changed.

“The unfortunate thing, when they turn into wolves, they lose their human counterpart. They will listen toyour command and are incredibly loyal.

Since they have ranking blood in their system, they are strong. An army of these can easily defeat a regular army of wolves.” Mark’s eyes scanned the room. Most of the guys were nodding. Some had smiles on their faces and some looked at the man like this was the most horrific thing they had seen.

The man’s screams went from human to more of a growl. Mark looked back over and saw fangs slash through the tape. His shoes ripped off his feet as they resembled more claws than anything else.

“What is in that potion?” Someone

called out.

“I'don’t give away my secrets but there are some different types of drugs, herbs and other things that everyone dabbles in. I am in the process of securing the most powerful blood there is. Once I do that, this will be unstoppable.” “Who's blood is the strongest?” Mark’s eyes went over to Sir Joe.

“penelope Jeffrey.” Vin answered as his eyes narrowed.

“Alpha Colt’s mate, Penny?” Someone yelled out.

“Exactly. Did you know that she has was the only remaining heir to the alpha title? As Darin’s older sister, she was going to inherit it all.” «Then why was he after Kristen?”

Follow current on noveldrama.org

Another man yelled out, “I thought he just wanted her body!” Another one said.

“Half false. He wanted to mate because they would make strong blooded children. With her IQ and blood status, she should have been the strongest female. Colt is her twin. Their DNA is the same so she would have been about 3/4th alpha blood. However, since Penny actually holds the title now of both alpha of two packs and luna, she is now stronger than Kristen. Penny is 100% pure alpha blood.” “So, you plan on kidnapping the pregnant mate of on the the strongest alphas in the U.S?” A man said. noveldrama

“Between him and Alec, they are untouchable.” “Half true.” Vin pointed at that man.

“With the help from my uncle and if we all gather together, we will have the power and numbers to do this. Add ina few of these bad boys and we shall be victorious!” Right on cue, the man snapped all the chains off his body and stood up.

Letting out a deep growl, he finally relaxed. Breathing heavily, he sat down and howled up. Making all the men howl in response. Even Mark howled to make sure he blended in.

“To sweeten the pot, I have a little more information for you all. Call it incentive or whatever you want but what I have to saw might change your mind.” Vin paused for the dramatic effect. Looking around, most of the men were on the edge of their seats, waiting and listening. “Penny is indeed | pregnant. The pups that she is growing

will not only have her blood but Colt’s blood as well running through their veins.” “Pups?” Someone yelled out.

Vin pointed at the man. “Thanks for catching that! Yes, I said pups. Penny is pregnant with triplets.”














###Chapter 0449 

“Triplets?” The whispers around the room was sickening.

“Just think how you could take a child and raise it as your own. Get their blood from them whenever you needed Ha My body was frozen as I listened to his plan. Alec had gotten up and was on the phone with people but it was background noise at this point. They didn’t want to kill Penny or sell her.

They wanted her blood. They wanted my kids. They wanted to use them as blood banks to create this army.

“Men. Get back here now! As soon as Mark gets free, we are leaving.” Alec said in our ears. It snapped me out of my tunnel vision and pure rage ran

through me.

“Penny is at the packhouse. Jacob has increased security and is with her.” Alec said to me as he sat back down.

“Move Kristen there. She might not be their target but they won’t pass up the opportunity to take her.” Vin was right, she has alpha blood running through her veins. Alec got up as I kept listening.

“Who needs a demonstration?” Vin's face was lit up. Mark moved around and landed on Sir Joe’s face. It was neutral. No smile, no hint of amusement or anything. The mafia commandments were their law. Wives are held to the same respect as the | men. Italian men did not have the same values at American men. They had |

Follow current on

traditional values that meant no harm to women unless provoked. Basically, Penny should be safe and it should be my head.

Vin clearly wants to go straight to not only Penny but the children. Plus, if I am not mistaken, one of their laws is appointments are to be respected.

doubt if I made an appointment with Sir Joe that I should be able to meet with him in a neutral ground and leave unharmed.

“Mark. I need you to turn on the bluetooth and pick up Sir Joe’s phone number. If he has an iPhone, we should be able to sync it together. The phone you have is a burner.” I said.


Alec looked at me confused but didn’t argue. The event was over and everyone was standing up. We watched

on the edge of our seats as Mark got up too. Since phones were prohibited, he had to do it incredibly delicate...

Thankfully, everyone was gathered around Vin and looking at the newly formed werewolf.

Downing the rest of his drink, Mark fake stumbled into the crowd. His bodyguards were clearly around him, making it impossible to get close enough. I was about to suggest a distraction when Mark intentionally rubbed on another guys genitals. noveldrama

“Fucker! Watch what you are doing!” His arm came up and punched Mark straight in the jaw. Mark positioned himself so after he got hit, he fell between the guards and against Joe.

Follow current on novel-online.com

“WHOA!” Someone yelled out. By the

time Mark opened his eyes, he was being hoisted up by the collars. “What is going on here?” — | “This fucker touched my dick!” The man that hit Mark was also being held by the collar.

“Iwas walking to see the wolf! I didn’t touch shit!” Mark spit out. He struggled against the hold but I could tell it was a feeble attempt.

“Both of you, out!” The old man walked to the door and held it open.

Both Mark and the guy got drug up the stairs and out past the shed. “Don’t fucking come back!” Mark managed to stay on his feet but acted like he was drunk. The other guy fell on his face, into the dirt.

“Bastard.” Mark spit.

“Say that to my face!” Mark watched the guy stand up but stagger a little.


I wasn’t about to watch this. “Mark, knock him out and get back.” As the man fell forward from the momentum from his fist, Mark | stepped to the side and landed a punch to his temple. His neck cracked so loud that I questioned if he didn’t just break his neck with the punch.

“Get it, Mark!” The guys approved as everyone started arriving back. As soon as Mark was back, he tossed me his phone and got into the SUV.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“Headed home?” “Alec, can you drive?” I asked.

Alec nodded and we switched places. As soon as Alec was back on the road, I |

started shifting through all the pictures and identifying names with faces. Creating a folder of what.

information we had on each person, I collected everything.

While the men snored in the back, I was typing nonstop. Hopefully, Ben had some information for me as well.

However, my first step is to call Sir Joe tomorrow and request a meeting. I knew I was putting in a lot of faith in their supposed commandments but what choice did I have? This was my family and if that mean meeting the devil himself, then that is what I would do.

I finally had the truth. All the speculations and all the ill-fitting clues have finally made sense. It felt great to finally know what was going on but I have never been this anxious before.

Failure wasn’t an option. This next 24 hours will determine if I am declaring war or if my focus is still one a singular person. The old man meant nothing to me at this point. I had what I needed.

By the time we made it home, my folder was complete. Every single person was identified. They had a sheet of information filled out with pictures.

[ had Sir Joe Gambino’s phone number so the only thing I needed to do was educate myself on the etiquette of the mafia. I had a mission in place and nothing was going to stop me. Nothing.

“Everyone is in your office, waiting for us.” Alec said as everyone jumped out of the SUV. His voice snapped me out of

my train of thoughts.

“Where is Ben? Does he have anything yet?” aT














###Chapter 0450 

“Not sure. We can ask them when we get inside.” Alec got out We were going to be on major lock down from here on out. “Warriors.” I mind-linked everyone. “Stage five lockdown!” I was met with a collective, ‘yes alpha’ and the alarm instantly went off. It meant that everyone is to stay in our territory. No one is to come and go but you can travel freely within the territory.

Walking up the stairs, there was this suffocating heaviness that appeared in my chest. I wasn’t accustom to this emotion but I knew what it was. Fear.

Fear of losing my family.

As soon as we walked into the office, my eyes immediately went to Penny.

She was sitting in my chair, smiling at something someone said. All eyes looked at Alec and I as I closed the door.

“This isn’t good.” Ice said. She tried to stand up but Alec got to her first and made her stay in her seat.

“Penny. We had a deal.” Walking up to her, I got on my knees in front of her and took her hands. “I told you I wouldn’t keep anything that had to deal with you, from you. What I have to tell everyone has everything to do with you. Do you want to stay here for this or do you want to go to your own space?” Penny looked at my face, read my sincerity and absorbed it. I knew

everyone was looking at us but I didn’t give a flying fuck. I watched as Penny accepted that this wasn’t going to be good news. “I don’t know.” “It’s your choice but you would have to remain calm. Any stress on the babies isn’t good for you or them.” “Maybe I should go get a snack.” Penny looked at me with tears in her eyes.

“I think that is a good idea.” Pulling her against me, her scent filled me, calming me. I should be calming her but it was her smell that calmed me.

Being away from her was difficult and today made it much worse. I could even start to smell my pups. They were starting to have their own unique smells and if I wasn’t already kneeling, I would have fallen. My family.

“Come on, Penny. I'll walk with you.” Sherry was standing up, holding her hand out for Penny. a “Take a guard with you at all times and never leave them.” I said to Penny. noveldrama

Penny nodded as I stood up. “Okay.” She said when she was finally on her feet.

“Grant. Luna Penny is going to the kitchen for a snack. Are you not to leave her for any reason, understood?” Mind-linking a very talented warrior, | he was quick to respond. €» “Yes, Alpha.” As Sherry and Penny walked out, I heard his voice down the hall greet them.

“What's going on?” Ice asked. Jasper closed the door and I hit the secure button. Within seconds, the windows

and doors were sealed shut. Nobody was leaving and nothing was getting } in. da “I don’t...” Shaking my head, I just ran my fingers through my hair. My stress was coming out and there was no hiding it.

“Colt...” Ice’s voice was one she saved for when she was scared. Looking at her, her eyes mirrored my worry.

“I can tell them.” Alec offered.


“No.” Taking a deep breath, I started in. “Vin has an uncle. Sir Joe Gambino.” “Isn’t that the mafia due?” Jacob asked.

“He’s in Italy.” Jasper agreed with Jacob.

““...and human.” Jacob followed up.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“All wrong.” Interrupting them, both of their heads snapped to me. “He is now in the U.S. He is the head of the mafia family in Italy but he is here and he is Vin’s uncle. Vin has called on his mafia connection to assist in his....

business.” “The mafia doesn’t deal with human trafficking.” Ice stated. “Do they?” Shaking my head at her, we made eye contact. “Vin isn’t trafficking girls. Vin has created a potion that turns humans into werewolves. Their human part is gone but they are werewolves. The issues is, the potion needs werewolf blood. The higher the ranking wolf, the stronger the blood.” “He made a werewolf?” Jasper was trying to absorb this information.

“Correct.” “You saw this?” Jasper continued. He looked at Alec as if to ask if I was lying or not. “Seriously?” Alec nodded. “We watched him do it.” “How?” Ice asked in a far away voice.

Leaning forward, I placed my hands on my chair and stepped back so I was partially bent over. “That house to torched? It was to bring girls there but not for the reason we thought. Darin would lure the girls in. Interview them and possibly assault them but would take them to the basement to experiment on them. Females are genetically tougher than men. As in they endure more physical strain like childbirth, household chores and more

bent over activities that would kill our backs. The higher ranked the female, the stronger the blood, the better transition of wolves.” @ “Penny is an alpha...” Ice’s face was white.

“That is why they origionally wanted you. We are twins, making our genetics the same. You were the strongest female when I took over because I was an alpha. Darin wanted to have babies with you so he could use their blood to fuel his. Now, Penny inherited the pack and is a female alpha. Where you are lacking as a luna, Penny is 100% alpha.

She is strong than you. They want Penny’s blood and they want our pups to raise as their own blood bank.” It was hard getting the words out. Just saying it made me so pissed off that my

claws dug into the chair. Chunks of foam fell to the floor in the room of complete silence. S— No one said a word. Ice had her hand over her mouth. Jasper and Jacob looked fucking pissed and Emmy was looking horror stricken.

“What’s our next move?” Jacob asked looking at me. His eyes were full of hatred.














###Chapter 0451

 «well, I am going to call Joe and ask for ameeting.” The room erupted in fucking chaos.

“The fuck do you mean?” Ice shouted the loudest.

“No, man!” “stop!” Holding up my hand, they all quieted down. Only after they were quiet did I start talk again. “One of the Jaws mafia men live by is meetings are to respected. They don’t miss meetings and it is considered neutral. Obviously, 1 will be taking men but this is to just meet and have a conversation.” «About what?” Ice asked. Looking at her. Alec was holding her against him like she was going to come at me and

hit me.

“Mafia families don’t push themselves into other’s fights. This isn’t his fight.

It’s Vin’s. One that Vin started without any push from us. It will allow me to gauge his feeling and see if he is a player in this. At the end of the meeting, I will know if we are declaring war or if my focus is still only Vin. We will both lay out our intentions and go from there.” Jasper stood up and started pacing.

“you are putting a lot of faith in a mafia boss.” “Who operates based off respect. If we show respect, we should recieve ie! It was Jacob’s turn. “It could go 100 ways wrong.”

“I’m aware but what choice do I have? My mate and three unborn children’s lives are at stake. If they get their hands on them, they will be shipped off to Italy and I'll never see them again.” Everyone was quiet as they let the gravity of the situation consume them.

Ice finally sat down on Alec's lap and Jasper followed not long after. “Ice, you need to be under protection. Their focus might be Penny but your blood is still incredibly strong. If given the opportunity, they will take you too.” Ice had this far away look to her.

“Okay.” She finally said to no one in particular.

«] think we all need to turn in for the evening and gather our thoughts and

figure out the best way to address this.

I'll call Joe in the morning after I do some research tonight.” “Sounds good.” Jasper stood up after a moment and took Emmy by the hand.

Going back to my desk, I sat down and unlocked the office. “Colt?” Ice’s voice drew my eyes up. She was looking at me with an emotion in her eyes that I barely ever saw.

“I’m okay, sis. Just like we did before, we will figure this out.” I tried to reassure her that I was still mentally able to function. It was a complete lie but I wasn’t about to allow a pregnant woman, let alone my sister, get emotional about my emotional state. noveldrama

«you're not okay but all my attention

and focus will be on this.” Smiling at her, I tried to give her my best humorous face. “We already won.” The look on her face told me she didn’t buy it but she didn’t argue. Instead, Alec pushed her out the door. After he made eye contact with me and nodded, he followed her out too. Jasper and Emmy were next but Jacob stayed sitting on the chair.

“What are we thinking?” Jacob asked.

“well, I am trying to figure out the safest place for her to be. Honestly, I have an idea but it’s a crazy one.” pulling up to my computer, I went to G****e to figure out about mafia etiquette.

“Where is that?” My fingers didn’t even stop typing as 1 { responded. “The cells.” “What?” Jacob looked at me like I was crazy.


“Think about it. It’s undergrown.

Nothing is going to penetrate it. What enemy thinks to go to the cells to look for someone? Honestly, if you were them, where would you assume we would keep her?” “Fuck.” I could see Jacob run his fingers through his hair out of the corner of my eye. “Is there even cell service?” “No. She couldn’t have visitors and we would have to make major comminations.” “The better solution would be to just

build a safe room. Dig a big ass hole and make our own.” Looking at Jacob, I could see it was more of a sarcastic remark but it really wasn’t a bad idea. We could build one for the ranking women and then build one for all the women and children of the pack. As a backup safety thing.

“That is a good idea. You are in charge of that. I want it done in a week.” Turning back to my computer, I missed his facial expression.

“Do what?” “you are in charge of building a safe room for Penny and our three children.

[ want it done in a week.” «But... I...there is... um....” “Get it done Jacob.” I didn’t command him but I did change my tone to make

sure he knew I was serious.

“Alright. I'm on it.” Jacob looked concerned as he stood up. The office door opened just as he was about to turn and walk out.

“Am I interrupting?” Penny’s voice was sweetness to my ears.

“No. I was just leaving.” Jacob sounded weary. I wasn’t sure what was his problem but I didn’t really care either way.

Penny waited till he walked out before she spoke to me. Sitting down, she asked. “What is his problem?” «Don’t know and don’t really care.” “Everyone looked really sad when they left. It’s bad isn’t it?” Penny sounded worried.

Not wanting to lie to her, I just told her the truth. “Yeah, it’s bad. I can either tell you or you can just trust me.to keep you safe. That means you need to do as I ask without question.” “I mean, I’d do that anyway but just give me the cliff notes of it.” Looking up, Penny was biting her lip.

“Are you sure?” “Yeah, just the PG version.” As much as I didn’t want to, I wasn’t going to keep this from her either.

“Okay.”

“There was a different reason Darin wanted Ice. He has made a potion of sorts that will transform humans into werewolves. They lose their human counterpart and are only werewolves.

Loyal to their maker, they are just as strong and aggressive. In order to make the potion, they need blood. The stronger the blood, the stronger the potion. The stronger the potion is, the better chance the human has at surviving it. Female blood is strong than male blood and alpha female blood is the strongest.” @» Pausing, I waited to see if Penny would connect the dots so I didn’t have to do it for her. “That makes sense... I guess.

In a twisted way but I can understand that. Kristen does have strong blood.

She is your twin and you are an alpha.” “Yes but they reason they want you is because you are not a partial alpha. You are a true female alpha.” @ “He wants my blood.” Penny seemed to take it better than I thought.

“Yeah. He wants to take our kids and raise them. He will use them and you for a constant blood bank for these potions.” Penny was quiet for a while. Her facial expressions made it hard to predict exactly what she was thinking. Even through the mate bond, it was hard to figure her out. Still, I waited patiently for her to figure it out.

“Well...” Penny finally said. “...it honestly wasn’t as bad as I was

thinking.” “Not as bad as you were thinking? What exactly where you thinking?” “They wanted to harvest my organs or something.” Penny shrugged. “Still, getting kidnapped doesn’t sound like something I want to be part of.” Feeling slight proud of how well she handled that, I couldn’t help but smiling at her. “Jacob is going to build you a safe room undergrown. However, that wasn’t all of it.” Penny looked both surprised and weary. “What else is there?” “Vin has a mafia connection.


Apparently, Sir Joe Gambino is his uncle. He is currently here.” “Thhhhhhat is not good.” Penny agreed with a slow nod. “What are you

going to do about that?” Leaving forward, I put both arms on my desk. “I am going to call him and ask for a meeting.” Penny’s eyes widdened. “What?” “If what I read is correct, respect and meetings are something you don’t fuck with.” “What? You did an internet search and now your an expert on mafia ways of life?” Penny narrowed her eyes and was judging me hard.

“I know it’s not idea but it’s worth a try.” “Call him.” Penny folded her arms over her chest and looked at me like she was daring me to do it. Almost like she didn’t think I would.

“It’s late.” I said looking at the time.

“He is a mafia boss from Italy. He is awake. Call him.” “Fine.” Pulling out my phone, I was going to call her bluff. Finding his number that we got, I dialed it on my desk phone and put it on speaker phone.

It ran four times before he answered it.

His voice echoed in my office. “Who is this?” “Alpha Colt, Sir Joe.” Pause. “How did you get this number?” He sounded suspicious and amused. noveldrama

“Is that really the question you want to ask me?” I was using my alpha voice.

Penny shivered as I smirked at her. My

alpha voice turned her on.

“I suppose not. What can I do for you?” “I would like to request a meeting with you. I understand you are state side and I wish to discuss some...delicate matters.” “This is interesting indeed. A meeting is what you are after.” Sir Joe Gambino sounded like he was trying to wrap his head around talking to me or how I even got his number.

“Assuming you still hold mafia laws with upmost respect. By requesting a meeting, we should be able to meet with no blood shed and speak like gentlemen.” “I know you are merely inquiring about your safety and not questioning

our morals.” There was a slight challenge in his voice.

“You are a wise man, Sir Joe. Being a gentleman myself, I prefer to have face to face meetings. There seems to be a situation, that if we are going to become enemies, I would like there to not be any misunderstandings. Blood shed over misunderstands is nothing but waste.” “I would have to agree with you there.

Unnecessary blood shed is not something we practice.” “perfect, then we should be able to have a civilized discussion.” “You know what? I'll grant you a meeting. You have peaked my interest and I am willing to hear what you have to say.” Sir Joe was slightly laughing.

“Thank you for allowing us to meet. I do have one request though.” “Oh? What would that be?” “I'am requesting that Vin is not present. I am not sure I will contain my anger and not kill him as soon as my eyes land on him. Again, this is a mere request but in order for us to have a productive meeting, I believe it would be best he is not there.” Sir Joe laughed loud enough that I leaned back. “I like you. Sure, I will keep Vin away. Meet me tomorrow evening. The Mountain Spring Casino that I will be at. I will have someone waiting for you at 5pm.” “I would like to inform you that I will be bring a few of my own men. Two that will stand guard for myself and one more that will accompany me in

this meeting.” My heart was racing as I realized I will be meeting an actual mafia boss. This was both exciting and scary.

“That’s fine. I wouldn't expect anything else. I can promise no harm will find any of you. We will be gentleman and have a discussion on this matter.” “Thank you for accommodating my request. This is a unique situation.” “That it is. See you tomorrow, Alpha Colt.” Sir Joe said before he hung up.
















###Chapter 0453 

Hanging up the phone, Penny just stared at me like I was a ghost. “Welp, I guess I have to leave again tomorrow.” “Where did you get his number?” “Long story.” I'said as I dialed Alec’s number.

It ran twice before he answered.

“What’s up?” «We have a meeting with Joe.” There was a small pause. “Do what?” “penny suggested I go ahead and call him so I did. He agreed to meet with me tomorrow at 5pm at the Mountain Spring Casino. Jacob, Jasper and you

and me are all going in. Jacob and jasper can stand guard at the door. You and I will meet with him. I have requested Vin to not be theresol didn’t kill him. Otherwise, he agreed no blood will be spilled.” “Well, shit.” Alec said.

“How can you trust him?” I heard Ice ask.

«1 don’t think it is a trust but a mutual agreement to no kill each other. So, we can have a conversation like gentlemen.” «Does that mean I have to wear ad suit?” Alec groaned.

«yeah, sure does. We are representing werewolves. If it goes our way, we can form some sort of agreement with the biggest mafia boss.”

“If it goes bad?” Ice asked.

“Then we are declaring war against Vin and his mafia uncle.” There really isn’t another way around this.

Follow current on

“I don’t like this, Colt. So many things can go wrong.” Ice sounded really worried. Although I understood her concern, it also annoyed me. We did everything in order to keep her safe.

Now, it’s Penny's turn.

“I’m not about to let Penny become a blood bank, Kristen. If I have to meet with Joe by myself I will.” «phat isn’t what I meant and you know that.” “Okay!” Alec chimed in quickly. “I'll see you tomorrow.” Click! Alec hung up the phone.


“She doesn’t want Alec to go?” Penny

asked.

I half forgot she was in the room with _ | the way Ice was acting. “It’s not that. It will be dangerous and since we already have taken so many dangerous jobs, it’s taking a toll on her for him to be gone more.” I tried to reassure her that it had nothing to really do with her but the situation in general.

“I brought us a bag to stay the night here.” Penny said, quickly. She wanted to change the subject and I wasn’t complaining.

«That was very thoughtful of you. Are you ready to head to bed?” Penny took a second but she finally stood up. “Can we watch a movie?” «Of course.” Sighing, I looked at the computer. ‘Can you get it started and I

will be right there?” Penny gave me a small smile as she 4 walked to the door. “Sure. Don’t take too long.” “I promise.” As soon as Penny shut the door, I went and started writing down a few notes.

First would be Gunther and Kara. The fact they found the trackers was alarming. I haven't felt Kara's bond break. Since she was a pack member still, I would know when she died.

Follow current on novel-online.com

Since that hasn't happened, she is still alive somewhere. The question is where. However, if Vin did have them, they will be probably getting tortured.

That one top priority. I might not like them but I wasn’t about to leave a pack member behind. The issue is, Twasn’t

sure where to look for them. The second thing would be if we are to declare war. Which, in all reality is the expected outcome. At least this way, we will have an idea how things will go.

Joe didn’t come down here to just visit and Vin needed the help. noveldrama

It would be bold to assume Joe was working out of the casino. Pulling out my phone, I sent a message to Alec.

Me: Send the men to the casino to scope it out. Watch for Vin or Joe and follow either one if they leave. We need to find their base if we want to get Kara and Gunther back. Pay attention to the side and possible secretive exits, like the parking garage. We need to have eyes on them. Eyes only.


Hitting send, I was about to put my phone away and turn off my computer

but it started to ring. It was an unknown number but there was a weird feeling about this.

“Alpha Colt.” I said, firmly.

“$500,000 in cash.” It was the old man.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

It took me a second to register what he said. “Okay.” “Okay?” He asked, confused.

«Give me something first that would intrigue me.” «yin brought his uncle over from Italy.

He is a mafia boss.” “Sir Joe Gambino. I'm aware already.” The old man huffed over the phone.

“Okay, well, did you know there will be

another auction in a week?” “This interests me how?” “Gunther’s mate is in the lineup.” Now that intrigued me. “Continue.” «1 was asked to call buyers and given the list. She is the star person as she is Gunther’s mate. Vin is strictly against mates so Gunther had to let her go.” «He did this willingly?” 1 asked, completely shocked.

“He might have asked me to get ahold of you as a favor to him. He doesn’t know I am accepting your money though.” He sounded bitter.

“Why would you do that for Gunther?”

“None of your damn business.” His anger surprised me.

“you care for him.” “Might have helped him outa time or two but that’s none here nor there.” “Where is she being kept?” Looking a the clock, I knew Penny would be wondering where I was here soon.

«hat I have no idea. That’s why I told you about the lineup.” “Any suggestions on how to get her out?” I asked, that wasn't built for escape options.

“Do it after she is bought and the buyer takes her out.” “gp, you want to piss off another person to have beef with?” He couldn’t

be serious.

“Well, then you can figure it out.” “Ill tell you what. I'll give you $250,000 for that information and I'll give you the rest after I get Kara out.

That sure encourage you to figure something out that doesn’t involve me pissing off another person. Let me kill Vin first.” Hanging up before he could reply, I got up and headed to Penny. My phone dinged before I got there.

Alec: Just sent them Opening the door, I sent a reply to Alec: Found Kara. Let you know tomorrow.

As soon as I hit send, I put my phone in my pocket and looked up. Penny was

already asleep on the couch. The movie was still running the opening credits but she was out. Going to the closet, I got myself ready for bed. Then I folded down the bedsheets, turned the T.V off and picked Penny up. She stayed asleep as I put her under the covers and curled around her. With my hand on our children, I closed my eyes and fell asleep.

The next morning, only coldness touched my skin. Not wanting to be awake yet, I tried to reach for Penny but she wasn’t there. Cold sheets greeted my hand as I felt for her.

“Penny?” I asked out loud. Rising my head up, I looked through one eye into the room.

Penny was sitting on the couch. When I said her name, she looked up and smiled at me. “I'm sorry I fell asleep

last night. I got uncomfortable. Turns out, I do need that pregnancy pillow.” Pulling myself from the comfortable bed, I got up and moved to the couch.

“I can have someone get the pillow for you today but I would like you to stay here as much has possible.” “T understand. You won’t hear an argument from me. I was able to finish all the stuff for the Halloween party.

Plus, each program I have installed have really thrived. So far, we only have little issues but nothing that we didn’t anticipate.” “That’s great to hear.” I was so proud of her for all she has accomplished.

“When do you need to leave? I have already requested your suit be pressed.

It should be here in about an hour.”

Penny went back to tying on her computer. noveldrama

“You are honestly the most amazing person on this planet.” Leaning over and kissing her forehead, I needed to shower and get ready. It’s been awhile before I trimmed my beard and it was getting rather long. Usually, I go for the shadow look so having something I can run my fingers through was a little much.

There was something refreshing about being freshly showered, shaved and styling my hair that made me fell like my life was put together. “Colt?” & Penny opened the door and looked at me. I was standing in front of the mirror as I finished my hair.

“What's up?”

Follow current on novel-online.com

“Your suit is here and so is Alec but I think you should save your suit till you get there. You have a long car ride ahead of you.” “Sounds like a good idea.” I said as I finished doing my hair.

Penny turned and walked back to the couch. Following her, I saw Alec and Jasper standing in my room.

“Boys ready?” “You never answered my text.” Alec frowned. “You found Kara?” “Kara was missing?” Penny was half bent over. She straightened up so fast that she about fell over. Thankfully, Jasper was close and was able to catch her.

“Yeah. I think I found her.” Giving Alec a look, I wasn’t happy he said anything

in front of Penny. He seemed to understand as he changed the subject.

“Our suits are in the car. Jasper, why don’t you take Colt’s down and we will be right now.” Alec rubbed the back of his neck.

Jasper must have caught on as his eyes avoided all eye contact and walked out with my suit. “Not very subtle.” Penny glared at me.

“You knew I didn’t tell you it all.

Honestly, we just found out that they found the tracking devices. We didn’t even know how long they had been found. I didn’t want to dump it all on you.” I tried to plead my case.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“Where is she?” “I got word she is going to be sold in an

auction in a week.” “Sold? In an auction?” Penny looked at me like she dared me to argue with what I just told her.

“Yes. Don’t worry. We will get her before that. I literally just found out before I came to bed last night. Once I figure out how we are going to get her, I'll let you know.” “Please do. It feels wrong to let her just go through that. We already killed her in front of the pack.” Penny was feeling really guilty.

Knock! Knock! “Luna Pe- oh! I'm sorry, Alpha Colt!” The door opened and someone from the kitchen stepped in before looking at me.

“It’s okay! Come in.” Penny said as she sat down on the couch.

“Oh, um...okay.” She looked nervous as she pushed the door open and wheeled in what smelled like french toast and strawberries.

“Text me if you need anything. I'll see you either late tonight or tomorrow.” Going up to Penny, I had to step around the breakfast to give her a kiss.

“Please be careful.” Penny said to me but her eyes were focused on the strawberries.

“Always am!” Alec rolled his eyes as we walked out.

Closing the door behind me, I pushed him in the arm. “Dude!” Alec gave me a fuck you look.

“Why did you bring Kara up? You know Penny doesn’t want to know it all.”

“Sorry, man. Your sister was fucking pissed off at you. I've been hearing it for the last twelve hours. If she wasn’t mad at you, she is worried about you.” “I’m a lovable guy.” Smirking, we walked out of the packhouse and got into the car.











###Chapter 0455 

“Any word from your men?” I asked.

We were currently sitting in the casino’s parking lot. The front of our car was facing the entrance, making it impossible to miss the coming and going guest. Not a child in sight as casual men and woman to people in suits walking in and out. The decor was very nature themed with exposed treated wooden beams and wood carvings. A large Indian carving was the main focus but there was also a bear and a wolf. noveldrama

“They haven’t been able to see him coming or going. He must be working out of the casino.” Alec sighed.

“I hate fucking suits.” Jasper grumbled

in the back. We had stopped a few miles and changed into our suits before pulling up. Since we were a tad early, we just have been sitting there, allowing my anxiety to get high.

“You never did tell us what you found out about Kara.” Jacob thankfully changed the subject.

“The old man that runs the auctions said she was in the line up to be sold.

“If we save Kara, Vin will know that Gunther tipped us off. He has to know his time is limited.” Jacob kept going.

| Alec and I just looked at eachother as | they started to sound more like a married couple argument than a discussion. “You can’t think Vin has actually allowed Gunther to still live? No way that Gunther isn’t tied to a | chair right now.” Jasper sounded like | he was disappointed in Jacob.

“If Vin gave him an ultimatum. He could have easily ditched Kara.” “Only if he was so far deep that he didn’t think he could make it out.” Jacob snapped his fingers. “What if Gunther has to hand deliver Kara to the auction. With everyone else, of course but still. He would hand deliver her?” “She is marked. No one will buy her.

SURRY Ue 0 *15 BONUS There is another thing going on. I’m betting they just told you that to get your attention on the auction so they could get away with something else.” Opening the door, I was done listening to them. Even though they made a valid point, I needed to focus on this meeting and then Id worry about Kara.

“Time to go.” Stepping out, all four of us adjusted our jackets and started walking in. Alec and I allowed our auras to gently spread around us. Not enough to make people bow or question our movements but enough that they got out of our way. Jasper and Jacob instantly stopped bickering and flanked us like the betas they were.

The automatic doors opened and the

Looking to my right, there was a gentle that looked like he was twelve standing in a full tux. “That is me.” @ “Great. Please follow me.” He said and abruptly turned on his heels and started walking. Never once looking behind himself, he kept going.

Weaving our way around the tables and the bar, we went through a door.

As soon as the door shut behind Jasper, the noise was completely gone.

Instead, elevator music stuck to the

WW TY BUNUS velvet on the walls as we went down a set of stairs. Even the decor was different with shades of black, red and : even some purple. This gave me more vampire vibes than anything else.

Although velvet was the fabric of choice for these types of places, I never liked it.

At the bottom of the stairs, a long hallway that was dimly lit lead to two men standing on either side of a single door. “Sir Joe Gabino will see you now.” “Thank you.” I said as he opened the door for us. Jasper and Jacob kept their hands crossed in front of them as the four of us walked in to the massive office.

“Nice to meet you, Alpha Alec.” Alec didn’t respond verbally but nodded as he shook his hand. “1 hope I didn’t keep you from anything.” I said as I'looked around. There was a total of six men standing in different places around the room.

“Indeed.” He studied us a little more before speaking again. “Please have a seat. Can I get you anything to drink?” “No, thank you. We don’t drink on the job.” A drink actually sounded good but if what I read was correct, they frown on mixing business with alcohol.

Not only from me but from everyone that Darin owed money to. They will be coming after Vin. Not only are Alec and I untouchable, we will have the support from those who don’t want Vin alive either.” “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Sir Joe said quietly.

“However, | understand he is your nephew and I respect your position, If Vin is to drop his desire to acquire Lune Penny, I will stop my efforts in killing him.” € “...and turn a blind eye to his illegal activities?” “Simply asking Vin to back off wasn’t

going to work so I am trying to meet in the middle. The spillage of wolf blood, good or bad, will never sit right with me. am more than capable of killing anyone who threatens my pack, and will do so, but I won’t deny a outcome that will eliminate death.” “What do you think should happen with traitors?” Sir Joe asked. He started swirling his chair, back and forth slowly. My senses told me something was up.

“Kill them.” My eyes didn’t even blink or move off of his.

“Interesting.” Sir Joe looked over at his man. Instantly, the man walked out of a door. Coming back a second later, he was dragging a very bloody man.

Forcing him to knee in front of me, they grabbed a handful of hair and

ripped his head back. “I think you know this man.” &» “Unfortunatly.” Frowning, I wasn’t sure I would be able to save him this time.

Gunther’s eyes were both swollen shut.

A deep gash under his eye allowed the swelling somewhere to go and not forced his eye out of the socket. His nose was angled in three different directions and he had three lips instead of two.

“It seems he has been working both sides.” “Under my orders, yes.” I said, simply.

“You see, there is one thing that is stronger than the bond you have with your alpha. The mate bond. He is mated to a woman from my pack. I assume you already knew that, [ won't

pretend you are stupid enough to not do your research. Who am I to reject someone willing to put their lives on the line for me when they aren’t even part of my pack?” “I must say, I was very impressed you put the trackers under his tongue. He wasn’t even aware it was there.” Sir Joe nodded.

“I’ve learned a few tricks there and there.” @ Sir Joe leaned forward and pulled out a 9mm gun out from under his desk.

Setting it on his desk, he looked at Gunther. “So, what to do with him?” “He isn’t part of my pack. Although, I would like to honor my promise to him and try to keep him alive. Though, he knew the risks and what was on the

line. Truthfully, it would be one less thorn in my side if you just kill him.

Might be doing me a favor but Iam still aman of my word. The decision is your’s, obviously but is there room for discussions?”

“Honor. I like that. Maybe if things were different, I would be interested in doing business with you.” Sir Joe picked up the gun and looked it over in his hands.

“If we don’t have our morals, what do we have?” It was physically painful to sit still and not try to defend Gunther. noveldrama

Waiting for Sir Joe to decide if he was going to kill Gunther was harder than I thought it would be.

“You are right but that doesn’t answer what I should do with him.” “Like I ask, I am open to discissions but seeing how Gunther only betrayed Vin and not you personally, he should be given back to me to handle as I see fit.” |

Sir Joe looked at me and narrowed his eyes. “I could just give hirn back to vin.” - “If you were going to do that, he wouldn’t be kneeling in front of me...

with all due respect.” Sir Joe took a couple puffs from his cigar and just stared at me. The room was so quiet that you could probably hear a mouse run across some carpet.

The gun was still in his hand but just pointed at the ceiling.

“You see. I don’t like traitors.” In one motion, Sir Joe pointed the gun and fired it. Forcing my body to not flinch, I expected Gunther to fall on his face.

Instead, the body guard behind him tell, grabbing his stomach. Every single man in the room, remained as still as Statues. ¢

Chapter D457 0) +15 BONUS “He betrayed you?” I asked, finally looking at the man. It was a gut shot and he would be dying slowly.

“He has been but I've been keeping him around to make my point. I don’t give second chances and like you said, Gunther hasn’t betrayed me. I will show you an extremely rare show of faith and release him back to you...

alive. This will never happen again.

However, if I see him again, I won’t hesitate to kill him.” The guards dropped Gunther. With a little shove, Gunther fell forward. His nose broke his fall, making such a sickening sound that I wasn’t sure he will even have a nose after this.

Thankfully, I didn’t have to ask Jasper or Jacob to get him. I watched as they took him in their hands and drug him to the back of the room.

“I greatly appreciate your mercy. He will be dealt with accordingly.” I said.

Sir Joe pushed his cigar against his desk as he sat up. “I have no doubt that will be true. Let’s get back to the topic at hand. Shall we?” The dying man started groaning in pain. Without even looking, Sir Joe turned the gun back to him and shot him between the eyes. “I can’t stand when grown men whine.” “Indeed.” I agreed. It was annoying.

Not sure it was shoot you between the eyes annoying but he wasn’t wrong.

@ “Where we come from, blood is thicker than water. One person’s problem is all of our problem.” “That is the way of life but how much

as Vin actually been part of the family? Has he even helped out in the past to warrant your help now?” - “That... is none of your concern.” Sir Joe folded his hands together and pierced his lips together.

“Given that he hasn’t lift the country, and the fact that you haven’t been state side in over a decade, I am going to say no. As much as you do your research, I do mine. My only compromise is me leaning the auctions alone if Vin drops is focus on Penny.” “Truthfully, these werewolves would benefit us all. It would only make you stronger. What’s the harm in this?” “Besides killing innocent humans, which directly violates our laws. It also means using my mate as a blood bank.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

Neither of which I am going to stand for.” Sir Joe waved me off and leaned back.

“A vial of blood here and there hardly makes it a blood bank.” “You honestly think Vin is going to leave it at that?” I asked him, meeting his narrowing gaze.

He was silent for a minute, which answered my question. “I'm not sure we are going to come to an agreement today.” I watched as Sir Joe shrugged and leaned back. “I can see that.” After a moment, Alec and I stood up. “With all due respect, this is business for you.

| Vin is barely a nephew and this is more of a business deal for you. If he wins, you will get to create a new army to force people to do what you want. It

will give you a new way to extract information out of men. For me, this is personal. Which one is more dangerous? Once I leave this room, we will become enemies. I will not stop until Vin is sleeping with the fish. The time will come when Vin betrays you.

He is only out for himself. I don’t show mercy to those who try to kill my family. Who’s more dangerous?” @» Straightening my jacket, I buttoned the top three buttons and turned to leave.

Just when I was half way to Jacob and Jasper, Sir Joe called out. “Alpha Colt?” Stopping, I turned to look at him. “Yes, Sir Joe?” “It was a pleasure meeting you.” “Thank you for the hospitality.” Turning

back to Jacob, I looked down

at Gunther. “Pick him up and let’s go.” My adrenaline was pumping and I really wanted to punch something. I will be declaring war. Fucking Gunther better have some information for me. I have to somehow save Kara on top of everything else.

I knew we were getting looks as Jasper and Jacob had to literally drag Gunther.

My strides were as wide as I could make them without looking like I was running. All I wanted to go was go home and hold Penny in my arms.

“The men caught some movement on the road ahead.” Alec was looking around as we got into our vehicle.











###Chapter 0458 

“What is it?” Getting behind the wheel, the engine roared to life as I slammed on the grass. “Who is it?” “Some of Vin’s men.” The gas peddle was already to the floor otherwise I would have pushed harder.

“Is Vin there?” “No. They recognize the men.” As Alec said the words, the heads of the men came into view. Then their torso and finally their legs. It wasn’t just one or two men but around a dozen or so.

There was a moment I thought about just plowing through them but I didn’t want my vehicle to get totaled. “They have a shot?” “They do.” Alec confirmed and put his

phone down.

Slamming on the breaks, I was ready to break some bones. “Get your recorder out.” I told him before we got out of the car. Alec fumbled for a moment before his hand grabbed the door handle.

“I'wondered if you were going to get out.” The ring leader said as we exited the car.

“What is your name?” I asked in my full alpha voice. Taking off my jacket, three of us were rolling up our sleeves.

I just took my shirt off.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“None of your concern. I'm just here to send a message.” The guy was as wide as a dump truck with muscle. It was to the point that his arms laid away from his body,

“You boys honestly think you are going to take on two alphas and their betas?” Taking a few steps, I was ready-for it.

“We have some help.” He nodded to the cars behind him and I immediately recognized the newly transformed wolves.

“Alec.” I said quietly. A moment later, a shot ran out and one of the wolves fell over dead. Before they registered what happened, a few more shots rang out, killing all of them.

“You bastard!” He looked fucking pissed.

“You thought we would come unprepared? How stupid is Vin?” Walking up to him, I got in his face.

“Give me a reason.” I whispered.

The guy pushed his finger in my chest.

“Vin isn’t going to like this. Your precious mate will soon be my toy.” Wrong fucking answer. I didn’t waste time in pulling my arm back and using every ounce of power in that punch. I was vaguely aware of my men keeping his men back as I went to town on his fucking face. Grabbing his shirt, I kept going on his face until it was completely smashed in. Not even a drop of sweat had formed by the time I was done, however, I was breathing a little heavily.

Not finished yet, there was this idea that came to my mind that put a smirk on my face. Going to the trunk, I kept a small office back here for emergencies.

Grabbing a pencil, I wrote on a piece of paper.

‘Good luck’ After signing my name, I grabbed the stapler and walked back to the men.

The paper laid across his face as I slammed a few staples into his forehead. Finally satisfied, I looked around.

“Make sure Vin get this.” After one last look, I was done. “Let’s go.” Thankfully, the men didn’t even hesitate to get out of our way as we pulled out. Swerving once, the car clipped the man. Leaving tire tracks across the paper as a little something extra.

“Here.” Alec handed me a wipe.

“Thanks.” Taking it, I was able to clean the blood off my hands and chest.

“I'm sorry.” I heard Gunther groan

from the back.

“I don’t want to hear a fucking word from you right now.” BE The rest of the ride was silent. No one said a word. We didn’t stop for food and we didn’t listen to any speeding signs. Since it was in the middle of the night, not many cars were on the road.

Pulling into the packhouse, I just needed to see Penny. “Take him to the hosptial and under a guard. No one is to speak to him other than a doctor.

Remember, he is suppose to be dead.” Slamming my door shut, my attention was only on Penny. © As the door came in view, I had to calm myself with a few breaths. Resting my head on the door, I tired to calm myself.

Suddenly, the door opened, making me almost fall forward. “Oh!” Penny stood in front of me. Her hair was down, she | was wearing one of my shirts with no pants. “Colt? Are you okay?” It was all I could do but look into her eyes. The big, beautiful eyes were full of worry but I was filled with anger, protectiveness and frustration. Instead of answering, my hand slipped around her neck. Pulling her a little more rough than I probably should have, my lips flattened against hers.

There was a moment I was worried I was hurting her but when her body relaxed into mine, I was done. She walked backwards as I pushed forward.

Slamming the door shut behind me, she was working on my belt.

| We didn’t speak or even comment on

the meeting I just had. Instead, we focused on eachother. Ripping my shirt | off her, a slight moan escaped her lips: I just needed to be inside her. I needed to feel her around me.

However, Penny had other ideas. As soon as my pants were off, she kneeled in front of me. Without breaking eye contact, her lips wrapped around my dick. “Fuck!” A deep throaty growl ran up my chest as she got to work. I had to hold onto the wall to keep myself standing.

It had been so long and she was so fucking perfect that I didn’t last long. noveldrama

One took a few minutes and I blew deep in her throat but the desire in me wasn’t done. Picking her up, turning her around and she immediately bent over the bed. J

I wasn’t sure if it was the belly or if she needed this too but she arched her back, ready for me to take her, — |


















###Chapter 0459 

“I'might as well move my office in here.” Alec walked through my open office door. It was bright and early in the morning. I wanted to talk to Gunther and finish filling out the emails. Currently, I was writing a mass email, telling all of my allies what has been going on. I wasn’t sure we needed the support but I wanted to make a fucking statement. No one was going to touch my luna and the fuck if something thinks they had the ability to do so.

“You are here early.” I muttered without looking at him.

“I hadn’t expected you to be up actually. Figured you would be in bed all day.” There was a little hint of

amusement in his voice. Last thing I was going to do was make a joke about him fucking my sister. x “Why are you here?” Alec sat down on one of the arm chairs.

“Your sister was worried and since I refused to let her come...so, here I am.” I finished my email and hit send before I'looked at Alec. “Why is she worried?” “You are declaring war today.” He said simply.

“Would you do it differently?” I challenged.

“No but you have an unhealthy connection to your sister, who is pregnant.”

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“I'wouldn’t say being a twin in unhealthy.” Rolling my eyes at him), I got up and walked out of the office, “I'm curious how the triplets will act when they are born.” Alec caught up to me.

“Probably about the same. Are you here to be helpful or annoying?” “That was also a request from Kristen.

Now I have did what she asked, I can get back to work. If she asked, I accomplished my task and she can’t get mad at me.” It was all I could do to look at him and not roll my eyes for the second time this

morning. “What happened to your balls?” “They went down your sister’s throat last night.” Alec had a rare smile on his

face as we approached the hospital.

Gagging, I went to make a comment but Alec beat me. “That is the exact face she made.” “Fuck off.” Punching him in the arm, I felt my stomach turn.

“Alpha? What can I do for you?” A nurse saw me and quickly ran up to me.

“A man was brought in last night.

Where is he?” I was aware my tone was a little pissy but so was my mood.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“Umm.” The nurse looked around unsure before turning back to me and plastering on a fake smile. “I wasn’t here last night so let me ask the nurse who was and I'll be right back.” Turning, she practically ran away from me before I could even respond.

“So friendly this morning.” Alec muttered.

“Why don’t you just go home?” I whispered back. noveldrama

“Colt.” Jacob’s voice sounded behind me. “Alec.” He nodded as he approached. “This way.” He kept walking and led us to a set of stairs and up to the second floor. “I had them clear this floor. Only one doctor and one nurse are aware. You got her before I could get here.” “T assume he is alive?” I half wished he told me he was dead.

“Very much so. Lost a few teeth but alive.” Jacob opened the door. Two guards nodded as we walked into the the room. Gunther was hooked up to multiple different machines. A breathing tub was down his

throat and

he was unconscious.

“What’s wrong with him?” Alec asked.

“Internal bruising and damage. The doctor had to sedate him in order for his body to heal. He was an inch away from death. If you didn’t drive so fast, he probably would have died in the car.” Fucking damnit. “So, he won’t be able to tell us fucking shit.” “Afraid not. It will be at least a week or more before they will even think about bring him out of the medical induced coma. Apparently, the brain swelling was so great that it was going to fracture his skull.” &» “How is that even possible?” Alec asked.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“He has some skull fractures and the swelling is pushing it. Making it expand and brain tissue to push through it.” Jacob shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal.

“He could have information that we need and can’t get.” My phone kept buzzing as I was getting emails.

Hopefully, they were in response to my request for assistance. I wasn’t sure exactly what I needed but no stone would be left unturned.

“Come one. We have just a few days to figure out how we are going to be getting Kara back. Having her close might help him recover quicker.” Alec nudged my shoulder as he turned and left. €@ “Is Jasper coming over?” I asked.

“He is bring Kristen and Emmy with

him. Apparently, they are having a baby shower on friday before the Halloween event. Since all the other lunas will be here for that, they are doing it then.” “Shit. I forgot about the Halloween thing.” We were walking down the hallway and down the stairs. “We have to safe Kara and be back in time for that.” @ “Exactly.” Jacob looked just as worried as I did.

“On the bright side, there will be many more men here to help keep Penny and Kristen safe.” We had to squint as we walked outside. The air was starting to turn bitter but the sun was still bright as ever.

Having a baby shower at this point felt unnecessary but I didn’t want Penny to

not have a normal pregnancy. “How much longer does Penny have before she gives birth?” Jacob asked.

“The doctor isn’t sure. She is pure alpha and with triplets. I'm not sure there is another person in history with this situation. As big and uncomfortable as she is, it could be any day now. However, I think we probably have another few weeks.” The only thing that would make it worse, is if it was this weekend.













###Chapter 0460

 This week has been fucking hell. The information our team has gotten has been very limited. We will be leaving early tomorrow morning to get there early enough to watch any movement.

The old man hasn’t answered me or even called me. So far, all we know is Kara is being sold and that is from someone that isn’t exactly reliable.

Tomorrow is Friday and then after that, we have to jet back and be here for the stupid Halloween party. We won’t even be here to greet the alphas and lunas as they arrive.

“Are we clear on everyone's responsibilities?” I asked.

“I’1l be staying home, greeting everyone and missing all the fun.”

Jacob was bitter he wasn't going.

Jasper wasn’t going either but he was going to stay behind the scenes. He will be managing security and the newly installed system. Since this was a larger event for the packs, most of our warriors are staying here. The only ones going were Alec, myself and his five black ops.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

His black op guys were sitting in my office, making sure we were on the same page since I couldn’t mind-link them. “We got new ear pieces in.” Alec passed out a very techy tiny little brown thing. No wires at all. Just the littlest piece of plastic that fit in our ears.

“I’m not expecting any issues. So far the cameras are working perfectly. The motion sensor is catching anything moving from a mile out. So far, we

have dozens of foxes and the birds are really pissing off the guys.” Jasper = y | filled us in.

“The chances of Vin striking now while Alec and I are gone are incredibly high.

We need everyone on high alert.

“A few of our allies are coming in early and bring their warriors with them. I doubt the security will get any tighter than it will be.” Jacob sighed.

“1t will be your head if it isn’t.” Pulling the map towards me, I just stared at it.

“with all due respect, Alpha Colt. We have been staring at that map for hours. We need to get a few hours of sleep before we leave in the morning.” Sighing, I knew he was right. My eyes

Follow current on noveldrama.org

were starting to hurt, my back was protesting from being bent over and my legs were starting to get restless. \ The stress of all this was starting to take it’s toll on me.

“Alright. Let’s go to bed.” I said, finally conceding. The men all stood up but it took me until they all walked out that I finally stood up and walked out of my office.

My phone was in my pocket when it began to vibrate. I was so tired that I didn’t even look at who it was.

“Alpha Colt.” I said out of sheer habit.

“Are you ready for tomorrow?” It was the old man. His voice stopped me in my tracks and I was instantly awake.

“Where the fuck have you been? For someone that wants money, you sure aren’t fucking acting like it.” “I’m sorry. I've been busy and in case you havn't notice, things are a bit dangerous around here. Sir Joe has been here, looking at everything and taking a layout. There is only one exit so you better have a

good plan.” He was whispering and his voice sounded like he was hiding. The urgency in his tone was both alarming and annoying.


“Don’t worry, I'll get her. Just keep Joe comfortable.” After everything that was going on, I still respected Joe and knew this wasn’t going to be an easy thing. With only seven men going, we had to be quick, precise and efficient.

“1 did my part and I'll do what I can but everything else is on you.” Click! He hung up quickly before I could respond. noveldrama

Follow current on noveldrama.org

He was honestly the most annoying informant I had. Literally the worst one and the most annoying.

Hanging up my phone and slipping it into my pocket, I walked into our bedroom. Penny was laying out her dress for tomorrow. “I like those colors.” I said as I closed the door. She jumped a little in surprise but smiled at me.

“Do you? I wasn’t sure.” Penny’s cheeks looked flushed.

Walking up to her, I took her face in my hands. “Are you doing okay?” “yeah. I just did a lot of walking today.

Tomorrow, I am going to be sitting on a rocking chair on the porch with

Jacob. Emmy and Kris are going to join me. Emmy’s little one will be with a babysitter so we can greet everyone as they get here.” “I’m sorry I won't be here to greet them and help you with it all.” honestly did feel bad.

Penny sat down in the chair. There was a pillow that allowed her to turn to her side so the weight of her belly was off her back. “You shouldn’t. You need to save Kara. Regardless of what she has done, she is still our pack member and thus needs your attention. Besides, everything she did was to save Gunther. Yes, she went about it wrong but it’s the same as you doing what you need to do in order to save me.” Somehow, getting a lecture from Penny always helped put things into

perspective. Not that I liked it. “I know but I hate that it takes me away form these things. I've missed so many baby things because of this. I’ve missed appointments and now the baby shower.” “Do you honestly care about a baby shower?” Penny half laughed at me.

“That’s part of the job. Once this is done, you will be best dad to this kids.” “1 don’t care about the shower, I care about you.” Giving her a pointed look, I went to the closet to changed into shorts.

“Tell you what, I'll open everything and you can put it away for me.” “Sounds fair.” I had to smile at doing those mundane tasks.

“Tomorrow will go smoothly.” Penny said as I came out of the closet.

“Hope so.”

















###Chapter 0461

“I got doughnuts!” One of the guys said from the back. We were taking a large cargo van in case something happens and we needed more room than just for Kara. Failure wasn’t an option but | wasn’t going to deny other girls help if the situation allowed for it.

“Fuck yeah!” Another guys said, way to fucking cheerful. noveldrama

Alec got behind the wheel and we took off. The moon was still incredibly high in the sky with not a single cloud. The stars were shining, lighting the way for us. The moon’s energy was fueling my inner strength, makingfeel refresh. My wolf was already pacing in my mind as | kept thinking about tasting blood. He was just as angry as | was about the situation.

The guys in the back kept gossiping and talking like a bunch of women but Alec and | kept our mouths shut. His fingers were tapping on the steering wheel and | kept looking at the map.

There really was only one way in that made sense. The other roads were dirt and with the rain they have been getting, it would be a muddy fucking mess. Assuming they wanted to have the girls in there before anyone arrived, they would be moved in the daylight.

The road ran down the middle of the little ghost town but | had my eyes set on a completely different route. We needed to be ahead of them and that ment where we should attack at. Since we didn’t know where they were coming from, we had to make seducated guesses. Going in, | wanted to do this at least twenty miles before they even got to the town.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

Still, there were so many things that could go wrong. However, the men felt like they had a good plan. Using spike strips, they attacked explosives. The goal was to cause a crash, get her and get out with minimal fighting or exposure. Hopefully, they wouldn't be able to catch us as we ran but everything would have to go perfectly right. We made a plan B, C and even D in case different situations occur.

There wasn't any way we could be more prepared for a completely unknown situation. It was a the point that without more information, we were basically blind and hoping this worked out. | even sent a silent prayer to the Moon Goddess that this went smoothly.

As we approached the area that we would be using as our base camp, | sent Penny a quick message. Just telling her we were here and I'd let her know when we were headed home. Shutting my phone off, Alec shut the engine off. No one move or said a word until I opened my door and got out.

“Alright men. This is by no means the finale but this is the first battle of the war. Saving Kara will hopefully allow Gunther to heal quicker and with any amount to luck, sinformation. Remember your training. Remember the plan and above all, have each other’s backs. Everyone leaves here alive. Any questions?” Were standing around in a circle. Everyone was taking in each word | said, as if it was the last thing they would hear. After shaking hands, everyone ran off to get to their post. Two men would be serving as cover and five of us would be on the ground.

The container with the explosive was carefully picked up and carried into the adjacent forest. The sun was beating down on us.

Our fully back attire was forcing us to sweat but no one complained. Part of our training was to be able to handle this. Plus, the amount of empty bottles of water on the floorboard of the van, toldthey were perfectly hydrated.

Since we had no idea what tthey would be driving by, once we were set up and ready, all we had to do was wait. Alec was using his binoculars to look around. They were thermal so it was a little tricky in the daylight but it would still give us tto relax.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

At least it would give the men a chance to relax. As | paced around the sthree trees, the men were silently talking amongst themselves. Not really giving a shit what they were staying, | focused on the

road.

Occasionally, scars drove by but it was the traditional traveler. “Heads up. Possible convoy headed this way.” One of our look outs said in my ear.

Instantly, my heart picked up as we all rushed to get to our designated spots. “Any visual?” Alec asked.

It was still pretty early and we had only been waiting for about an hour but if this was indeed them, it would be amazing. “Four vehicles. All completely white vans. Limited visibility but....” He trailed off. “Positive idea on passenger. It's them.” This the sounded positive.

“It's a go for takedown.” Alec said as we kept eye contact.

My fingers kept tapping the earth as the engine sounds got closer and closer. “Approximately moving at 68 miles per hour.” “Five miles out.” The other overlook said. It was only then that | thought to myself that I really needed to remember their names.

“Three miles.”

“Signal jammer on!” | heard as the guys ran to the street. It took two of them to toss the strips across the road but we weren't as quick as | expected.

The first van managed to swerve and avoided the strips other than the back driver's side tire. As the air cout, the van swerved but managed ot stay upright. The second van hit the spikes full on but the explosives hit as the back tires cinto contact, forcing the van on it's side.

It was like slow motion as | watched the last two vans try to swerve but failed and crashed into each other.

“Launcher!” Alec yelled as him and | ran out to the vans.

Barely missing the smoke, it was like something out of a video game. The grenade launcher hit the back tires, making the van fly in the air. It spun a few times before landing on the roof. The sickening sound of metal scrape across the pavement sent shivers down my spine.

“I got this van!” | yelled as | ran down the street. Smoke was eloping the entire vehicle but it was the oil leaking that really madeaware of the danger.

The footsteps behindtold| was going to have help. The back doors were bent so it took a few tires ofpulling to get them open. The other guy handled the drivers. A total of four girls were chained to the walls. After a quick assessment, only one survived the crash.

“WE HAVE TO GO! IT'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE!” | heard my man yell behind me. He started grabbing my shirt and trying to pullbut | wasn't going to leave this girl. It wasn’t Kara but she wasn’t going to die. The chair that was holding her wasn’t breaking.

Even with all my strength, it wouldn't budge.


“I'm sorry.” | said as | grabbed her wrist. Without waiting for a response, | squeezed quickly and as hard as | could. All the bones in her wrist shattered, allowingto pull her hand out of the cuff.

| barely got my hand around her arm as | was ripped out of the vehicle, pulling her with me. Stumbling to my feet, we made it about three steps before the whole thing exploded, sending us flying through the air from the sheer force. Shielding the girl with my body, | took the brunt of it.

“Colt!” I heard someone yell but everything wa singing. Someone rippedto my feet and pulledalong. Everything was far away sounding but my eyes scanned the road. Sgirls were huddled together, holding on to each other, Alec had someone by the arm and the other men were getting their spikes.

It felt like twas standing still but it was probably only a few seconds before they started running to our own vehicle. | kept scanning the girls to see if Kara was there. My mind was fuzzy. One person was helpingrun and there was a girl on my other arm. | wasn't sure if | was dragging her or if she was dragging me.

How we got back to the van, | wasn't sure. Next thing | knew, | was being tossed in the back of the van. My shirt was ripped open and the sounds started coming back to me.

“We got her!” “Stop the bleeding!” “Any shrapnel?” “I'm fine.” | groaned as | forced myself to focus.

“Where does it hurt?” | recognized one of the men leaning over me.

“Just hurt looking at your ugly face. Status report?” | forced myself to sound more put together than | was.

“Colt! I'm so sorry!” It was Kara's voice. Instant relief floodedbut it was soon filled with anger.

“Mission a success. Five girls survived the wreck and we got them all. Broken bones and head trauma but all should live.” “The drivers?” | tried to sit up but it hurt my head too much. However, the bouncing of the van wasn't helping either.


“All dead.” “The explosives were a little over done.” The remorse in his voice was clear but | was just happy it went smoothly.

“The fuck?” The angry growl that cfrom my chest made a few of the girls whimper in fear.

“Sorry, you had a piece of the car sticking out of you.” “Just make sure he lives. I'm not about to tell his twin sister that her brother died on my watch.” Alec yelled back.

“He will be fine. Angry but alive.” They were working onas my head cleared. All that was left was a pounding headache. The ringing in my ears was starting to fade but it was still there.

“Alpha Colt, I'm sorry but I'm going to have to stitch you up.”

Everyone was quiet for a moment before someone put something in front of my face. “Bite this.” “Don't fight passing out.” Alec said towith a thick voice. noveldrama

Lifting my head, | tried to assess my injury. The gash was deep and about five inches wide. A chunk of meat was moving in and out as | breathed. It wasn't just a surface thing. This was layers of muscle.

My head hit the floor as | accepted my fate. Taking the stick, | bit down on hit as | focused on my breathing. Four pairs of arms held my arms and legs down. The girls shifted to the front while the men focused on me.

“Ready?” | heard him ask.

Squeezing my eyes shut, | just focused on the girl's cries. | knew he wasn’t going to show any mercy since it needed to get done and done correctly but fuck. His fingers shoved into my side a second before a needle stabbed me.

“FUCK!” | growled as my jaw clenched around whatever was in my mouth.

“Fuck, he is strong.” | heard the guys say. It sounded like they were trying to use all their muscle to keepdown. Penny's face flashed before my eyes, tellingto relax.

My mind instantly followed her. Surrounded by smoke, | followed her. She wasn't pregnant but she kept motioningto follow her. So, | started running. It didn’t matter how fast | ran, | couldn't catch up to her.


“Come.” | heard her whisper “I'm trying.” The urgency in my voice was clear. It was almost a worry as | tried to get to her.

Eventually, she stopped walking and turned away from me. The sounds of babies crying replaced her angelic voice, bringto my knees. As Penny faded away, three babies wrapped tightly in blankets laid before me.

Elijah Colt was etched into a nplate. It was on the chest of the first baby to the right. Cooper Brian was the next baby boy and then was the smallest baby of them all. Where Elijah and Cooper were solid babies, the little girl was the tinest. Wrapped in a floral blanket, her ntag read Eliana Penelope.

My legs gave out as | fell to my knees. Tears ran down my face as | scooped all three of them up. First was my little girl, the spinning image of her mother. So sweet and so little. Then my second born son. The one that will test my patience but be incredibly loyal to his friends. The one that is everyone's ride or die friend. The last one is my first born son. The one that is the heir to the pack. He will be strong and intelligent. He will guide his siblings on the right path, keeping them out of trouble.

This was my family. As | looked up, Penny wasn’t there. Standing up, panic rose as | kept looking around for her. “Penny!” | yelled over and over again but she wasn’t there. Nothing was there. The area | was at was completely white with smoke. Fog covered everything, only getting thicker as | ran. With all three babies, | kept frantically looking.

My little girl, my little Eliana started crying. It was like my stomach flopped as | stopped looking for Penny and focused souly on my daughter. She was already wrapped around my finger. My little princess.

“It's okay, daddy is here.” | said as | hugged all three of them close. As soon as she touched my skin, she relaxed under my touch. Elijah cooed, as if to tell her to quiet down and go back to sleep. She instantly closed her eyes before her sweet little breathing leveled out.

“COLT!” I heard a man’s voice from far away. My head snapped behindas | tired to see who it was. The voice was so familiar but I couldn't place it.

“Wake up!” | heard another voice call out.


Looking down, my arms were empty. All of my babies just vanished. Thinking | dropped them, my hands frantically searched the floor but cup with nothing. Slowly, | started getting pulled backwards.

“No! | need to find my babies!” | yelled but | just kept getting pulled back.

###Chapter 0464

“What's the report?” | asked as | tried to sit up. There was a sharp pain down my side that causedto flinch but | was done laying down. Penny pushed a button, moving my bed to a sitting position.

“We got Kara. She is upstairs with Gunther. He already is improving. Minor bruising for her with a few broken bones but over all she is okay. Sh was in the third vehicle which just crashed into the second van. | was able to pull her out as | watched you barely make it out of the van before it exploded. The girl will be fine. She won't have use of her hand since you shattered all of her bones but she is alive. In total, we saved five girls. The rest were dead and the drivers.... they are dead now. The issues, one of the drivers had the symbol for an Italian mafia on his chest. We aren't sure if he was Sir Joe’s man or not. However, he died in the wreck, not by our hands directly.” “That won't matter to him.” Resting my head back, | started to feel disappointed my babies weren't in my arms. Mentally, | knew that wasn’t real but | was ready for it.

“Didn’t think so. We made it back for the supper event, welcoming everyone. I'll take over for you if you don’t feel like going.

Everyone would understand as most of them watched you get rushed into the hospital.” “Fucking wonderful. No, | am going.” | said out of pure stubbornness.

“Colt, just rest...” Ice started.

“Kristen, you didn’t rest when this was you. Why do you think | will? These men cas our allies and staying in bed will only show weakness. After declaring war, it's a bad look forto stay in bed and hope they pick up my slack. No, | have to go to the dinner.” She frowned but nodded. “You have an hour to get ready and be down in the large ball room.” Alec said as he started ushering Ice out of the room.

“Next time, it's your turn to get hurt.” | groaned as | sat up.


“Naw, it's all on you. Besides, you don’t know who you saved, do you?” That confused me. Looking over at him, | gave him a puzzling look. “No. Who was it?” “Alpha Carson's daughter.” | was a little taken aback by that. “What?” Alpha Carson lived on the Midwest. He had the title of the most powerful alpha until Alec and | killed Rip and took

that from him. The only reason we are considered the strongest is due to the fact Alec's mate is my twin sister. Most people think of our packs as one.

“Apparently, they thought she ran away. Turns out, Darin had kidnapped her for her blood. She has been used as a blood bank for the last year. He was only selling her because she was mateless and her blood wasn't staying as strong.” “Damn.” Shaking my head, | looked back at Penny. Alec and Ice left the room as a nurse cin.

Holding up a needle, she smiled at me. “I have the antibiotic and then you are free to leave.” Her voice was far too cheerful for me. Resisting the urge to say anything, | just let her pokein the arm before she turned to leave. “Alpha Colt, Luna Penny. Letknow if you need anything else.” The door shut, leaving Penny andalone. “Where did you go?” She asked as she stepped back so | could stand up.

There was a sharp pain in my side but once | was up, | was doing okay. My shirt was gone. There was a vague memory of it being ripped off but that just allowed my new wound to be visible.

“What do you mean?” | asked as | took her hand and we slowly made our way out of the hospital room.

“You kept asked where your babies were.” Penny said in the mind-link.

“I passed out and had a vision of sorts. Our three babies were there.” “You had so much love spewing from you that it almost suffocated me.” Penny smiled atas we slowly made out way to the golf cart that she used to bring me.

###Chapter 0465

“It was my honor to be able to save her and it will be an honor to stand next to you in battle. You were always a good friend of my father’s. He held you in high regards.” Alpha Carson put his hand on my shoulder and didn’t speak. Instead, he nodded and allowedto continue into the house. It felt like I just got the approval from my dad with the way his hand gripped my shoulder. Just like my dad used to do. Up until now, | have always felt like | managed good without him but now | realized how much | actually miss my dad.

“I assI'm okay to shower. This can get wet?” | asked Penny for confirmation as we walked into our room. She had already laid out my suit for the dinner and her dress was hung up on the closet door. Although this wasn’t a dressy event, the host always dressed up a little more than the rest of the attendees.

“I wouldn't let it soak or put soap directly on it but you should be okay.” “Csit withas | get ready.” | worded it as more of a request but it was still a question. | wasn't fully ready to be away from her yet. That dream or whatever | had really fuckedup. | knew she was in danger but | never actually thought about what would the world look like if she died.

“Okay?” Penny agreed but | could tell she was a little surprised. “I will just do my makeup in the bathroom.” Helping her grab her makeup, she didn’t comment further as she set herself up in the bathroom. Turning the water on, | opted for more of a cooler shower so it didn’t fog the mirror for her. Plus, the cold wouldn't make this gash bleed more.

“How did you day go?” | asked as | reached for the shampoo. The water was a rusty brown as the dried blood ran off my body and down the drain.

“It was good. | just sat on the porch. We got lucky today was a nice day. Stayed about 70s range with a slight breeze. Thankfully, no one wantedto get up. The baby shower went great, if you didn’t notice all the gift against the wall.” “I didn’t but | wasn’t looking either. Anything in particular you liked best?” “Inoveldrama


can’t wait to you to see it all! I'm in love with it all.” Penny was feeling rather happy at the moment. Shutting the water off, | started drying myself off as she put on her light pink stuff on her lips. Not that | knew the difference between a gloss or chalk or whatever the stick was, the shade she was using was my favorite.

“That color looks great on you.” | complimented her.

Penny puckered up her lips and did a little pose. “You think so?” “I know so.” Grabbing her chin, | went to give her a kiss but she turned away.

“Don’t mess this up!” Not wanting to give up, | bent down and kissed her neck. “Better?” “Hmm, not really sure.” She gavea look as | laughed. Slapping her ass, | walked out of the bathroom and headed to my clothes. Penny sat down on her vanity and was working on her hair so | finished getting ready. Moving my arms above my head was trickly but | managed. There was spain pills that | took to help with it. Really to just take the edge off it.

| had just finished buttoning up my shirt when Penny stood up. “Can you helpwith my dress?” “Of course.” Penny had grabbed it an unzipped it. Stripping out of her shorts and shirt, she put both legs in the dress. Helping her pull it up, all I had to do was zip it.

The dress was a blush pink color that was incredibly stretchy material. Hugging her body, the mermaid style fit her perfectly. A sweetheart neckline flowed to the off the shoulder long puffy sleeves to a cuff. With her hair curled and left down, she looked absolutely amazing.

“Where did you get that dress? It looks great!” Grabbing my watch off my dresser, | was putting it on when she went to the packages.

She wasn't lying. The stack of presents was massive. “| got different clothes, blankets and look at the shoes!” She held up the littlest little cotton slippers for babies. Taking them, | couldn’t help but smile at how small these really were.

“These are cute.” | agreed.

“You know, we had so many gifts between us that | honestly don’t remember who got us those. | remember opening them. Is something wrong with them? Those were the patterns we picked out.” That surpriseda little. Was it as simple as that? My subconscious remembered these patterns and put the babies in them? “I guess | forgot we picked those patterns out. | just really liked them.” I wasn't fully convinced but now wasn't the tto get into it. “You hit your head really hard. Do you feel okay?” Ice asked me.

She slipped her arm in Alec's but kept looking atweirdly.

“| feel like a million bucks.” | tried to give her a smile but she saw right through it. Wrapping my arm around Penny, we left first.

Penny looked amazing but we walked so to accommodate her waddle.

“I'll go with her.” Ice said as she let go of Alec and grabbed Penny’s arm from me.

more forcefully than needed.

“Already done.” Jacob showeda little camera screen. Similar to what you would see in a baby room but this camera was following Penny's every move. “I slipped a tracker in their dress hems.

“Thankfully, we were able to ctogether for a few different occasions. First being the celebration of the future heirs for the Blug Fang Pack and the Black Moon Pack!” More cheers even louder as | felt Penny getting emotionally from the added attention. “I think we can all agree how radiant Luna Kristen and Luna Penny look!” The word alpha was on the tip of my tongue but it made Penny incredibly uncomfortable to be referred as Alpha Penny.

“Nothing in particular. Cassie keeps going back to when her and Zach were younger. | can't tell if she is just reminiscing or if she is actually reliving it. She will say things that are not exactly appropriate. I'm starting to wonder if she has spermanent brain trauma from all she had been through.” “Well, is she happy?” Penny looked atconfused. “What do you mean?” “Is she happy?” Penny picked up her glass of water and took a drink. “I suppose so, why?” “As long as she isn’t hurting anyone, I'd say let her be.

“Alright. Tto go.” Alec sighed as he wrapped his arm around her and pulled her away. “See you tomorrow.” “Love you, sis!” | yelled after them.

She just turned and smiled atbut her lips didn’t move. Since most everyone had retired, | went ahead and decided to call it a night. Laying down next to Penny sounded appealing.

As | walked up the stairs and to my room, Emmy was just coming out. “Oh, sorry Colt!” “You're fine. Did Penny need help?” “Yeah, her zipper was stuck. She wasn't sure how long you were going to be and didn’t want to bother you. We are headed out so | helped her real quick.” “Okay. See you guys tomorrow.” | called out as she walked down the hall. Going inside, | locked our door and went to find Penny.


The water was running the bathroom so | went there first.

“I didn’t think you would be done so fast?” Penny said before | even caround the corner.

“How did you know it was me?” | asked as | leaned against the door frame. She was in one of my t- shirts. Using a makeup wipe, she was cleaning off her face.

“You have a very specific walk.” “I do?” | was a little taken aback as | never thought about my walk.

“Yes, sir.” Leaning down, she splashed swater in her face before turning the sink off. Handing) her the foe she r&d fier face off anit started putting so many different types of creams. Men don't even wear cream and my skin is smooth as a baby's bottom. Why women use every product possible is beyond me. Please read the original content at

“I'll get a movie going and we can lay down and watch it.” “Sounds good.” She said as | walked away. Getting out of my suit, | just put on sgym shorts and put in Michael Meyers.

Might as well watch a holiday thappropriate movie.

| had just started turning down the sheets when Penny walked out of the bathroom. “That is what you picked?” “What's wrong with it?” “Nothing.” She was smiling as she laid down. Moving the pillows around her, there was barely any room foron the bed.

“| thought it was a fun choice.” Turning the lights off, | somehow found a spot on the bed it RE eet hiEpay tooka few minutes to find a good spot to lay.

Thankfully, there was plenty of pillows forto put under my side for support. Please read the original content at

“It was something.” Penny grabbed my hand and held into it. | UES sure why it yep poole hen shy Was bidse out within seconds if the movie playing. | made it though half before my eyes closed. Please read the original content at

###Chapter 0468

“Oh good, you are here already.” The door to my office was open so Jacob just walked in.

“Where did you think I'd be?” | didn’t even bother looking at him. Instead, | kept flipping through my papers and pictures to lay out over the meeting.

Jacob was wearing relaxed jeans with a nicer polo shirt. Thankfully, his shirt was a slate grey since we were wearing the sthing. However, | stayed with a black polo. My jeans were skinny jeans with my boots. The other alphas would say this is more of a younger person's style but it was what | was more comfortable in.

“In bed nursing your wounds.” The humor in his voice was clear but | was a little stressed out at the moment to laugh.

“Actually feeling pretty good today.” After double checking my folder, I finally stood up and straightened my shirt. “How much tdo we have before it starts?” Jacob looked at his watch. “Five minutes.” “Damn.” Walking past Jacob, we walked out of my office and headed to the meeting. “Is Alec here yet?” Looking over my shoulder, Jacob was walking with his hands in his pockets.

“Sure is. Already in there. He sentto find you.” “Why didn’t he just chimself?” | asked, a little annoyed.

“He was talking to Alpha Jace.” There was a total of six other alphas. Four of them were our age or a few years older. Their dad's retired or was killed. Only two were left of the original allies from when my dad started this group years ago.

Alpha Carson and Alpha Hank were in their late 50s or early 60s. Where Alpha Carson had more salt than pepper, Alpha Hank dyed his hair a dark brown. He refused to accept his fate in aging. However, both men were covered in tattoos and muscles.

Alpha Jace was a natural bleach blonde with freckles. He had such a baby face that he put a snake tattoo across his chest, around his neck and on his cheek. With working out for ten hours a day, he transformed his adolescence appearance to a bodybuilder in months. Jacob and | always wondered if he used any enhancers because of this.


Alpha Lars was the most similar to Alec and |. He stood at 6°7 with jet black hair. His golden eyes always drew the ladies in but they ran when he opened his mouth. His strong jaw line made his self- confidence a little too large. Still, he manged to never strick out at the clubs.

Alpha Aston and Alpha Anthony were seven years older than me. They had been running their packs for a decade now and managed to never need to gather everyone. Aston had light brown hair. He was the shortest one at 6'1 and on the skinner side but his fighting skills were more than anyone of us could imagine. His dad had sent him off to different camps to learn karate and other forms.

Alpha Anthony had blonde hair but black eyes. With freckles covering his entire face, he too decided a neck tattoo made him appear meaner. He was the most muscular of us but had the shortest temper. For that reason, he was my least favorite alpha to work with.

“Alpha Colt!” Alpha Lars looked atas | walked in and smiled.

“Are we doing formalities now?” Smiling, | put my hand out there for him to shake. Taking it, he shook my hand before givinga hug.

“Shit, no.” Lars tossed his head back and laughed. “Just felt like giving you shit. How are you feeling, man?” “Yeah, that was a lot of blood still on you.” Alpha Jace and Alec walked up to us.

“Doing better. Just a little stiffness.” “He had a chunk of muscle flopping in the wind.” Alec offered that bit of information.

“Gross.” Lars scrunched up his face.

“That's awesome.” Anthony nodded at the stime. Everyone else stopped talking and gathered around.

“Not my most favorite injury but not the worst thing.” Walking over to the table, the rest followed as we sat down. noveldrama


“Fuck, I'm starving.” Jace groaned as the staff walked out with medium rare steaks, mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

too.” Lars nodded and took a bite of his broccoli. His eyes rolled back in the his as he chewed.

“I'm glad you didn’t do a brunch like the women. This might be the last t| eat till the party.” Carson was more elegant with his manners but also dug in.

“That was Penny’s doing. She planned and executed this whole thing.” | wasn’t not going to give her full credit for this.

“Where have you been?” Anthony challenged.

“Trying to kill Vin and safe her.” | made sure my voice mirrored my annoyance for that question.

“Obviously, dude. What kind of question is that. Did you not read the email he sent out?” Lars started in on Anthony.

“I read it!” Anthony got defensive. “I was just making a joke.” “Not much of a joke. He has put his life on the line more times the last few week than anyone in the table has. Maybe expect Alec.” Lars dared Anthony to argue.

“Alright. We can focus on what's important.” Carson gave sien disapproving 00 @ssuch dais Wok'Hat all of us straightened up. Thankfully, Anthony had the common sense to shut up. Please read the

“We were able to kill Alpha Rip and Darin with minimal support but after the latest developcpijwe VaR mye sumer Wied and | have done a few things with our men but we also have suffered a loss.

“Tellagain who his uncle is. | know you said it in the email but tellagain.” Alpha Hank asked.

###Chapter 0469

“I'll just summerize most of it but I'll say it all.” | wasn’t even sure | remembered it all. Sof it was so trival that it seemed unimportant now.

“I'm sure Alec can help fill in sgaps if need be.” Looking up, Anthony had folded his arms over his chest and sat back. His words instantly fueled rage but it was Alec who responded.

“I can guarentee you that Colt has remembered every detail of his mate's life being in danger.” Where Anthony leaned back, Alec sat forward, daring Anthony to argue.

“Colt, please continue.” Carson glared at Anthony as he nodded to me.

“My beta, Jacob, found his mate. Sherry had a mate previous but he died and she found a second mate. That information is relevant because her sister was one of the women we rescued when we took Alpha Rip down. Tanya started spilling all of Sherry’s secrets and clued us in the hidden danger that was being plotted against Penny. Her past is not part of his and | have personally heard it. | will not be talking about it nor are any of you privy to it.” | took a second to look around, pushing my point through. Resting a little on Anthony, | continued. “Tanya told us Gunther was a ranking wolf but him and Vin managed to escape before everyone died. Vin was in business with Darin. We found out later that they would bring women to a house and do experiements on their blood. In addition, he would steal ranking women...” “... my daughter.” Alpha Carson interrupted.

“What does he need ranking women’s blood for?” Hank asked. By this time, everyone was leaning forward with their elbows on the table.

“He made a potion... or he calls it a potion anyway. A potion that he gives to humans. They will lose their humanity and turn into a werewolf. According to him, only ranking women’s blood has been successful in their transformation.” “He’s been doing experiments on humans?” Alpha Hank looked shocked.


“Him and Darin. They had a house in the woods. We raided it, found dead bodies and burned it to the ground. Here are those photos.” Pulling out the copies | had printed out, | slide each folder in front of the men.

“The castle that you see is Vin's. Not sure it's habital right now. We found it and had sfun with it. Unfortuantly, Vin got away.

You can see where we labeled the security and | have written out my detailed report. You can read those details later as it doesn’t contribute to the entire story.” “Who are these people?” Jace held up a picture of Kara and Gunther.

“Kara is my ex-girlfriend. That is her mate, Gunther.” Every pair of eyes looked at me. “Seriously?” Lars asked as he mouth dropped.

“Met at a bar. Anyway, she was trying to save Gunther by wanting to break into my office and steal papers. We cup with a solution. | was going to fake their deaths and make it look like | failed to give them the right dosage of medicine. Dropping their bodies off where Vin would find them as a fake fuck you kind of thing. It worked for a little bit but eventually they were found. | had put a tracker under their tongues. Gunther is currently fighting for his life in my hopsital under guard. Kara we just resued from being sold. That is how | got the gash in my side. The van blew up as | was pulling Carson’s daughter out.” “Damn.” Aston whispered. “You guys had your hands full. Why didn’t you call us in sooner?” “Hoping we didn’t need to declare war.” | sighed looking down.

“Who is this?” My gaze matched Anthony as he held up a third person. There was a part ofthat wished he wasn’t going to be brought up.

“That is Zac. Penny's dad.” “With all due respect, what is that story. She is an alpha?” “That is what brings up to why Vin is directly after Penny.” Running my fingers though my hair, | shifted uncomfortably before returning to my orginal spot. “Penny’s mother is Cassie. She was the daughter of Alpha John

and soul heir to the title. She had Penny with Zac before she was mated to Alpha Rip..." “Her and Darin were half siblings?” Lars looked even more shocked. noveldrama

“Yes. Darin wanted her dead so he took the title. He wanted Kristen to mate with to make strong blooded daughters but since he is dead, Vin has focused on Penny. She is a true alpha. She currently holds the title of Alpha. However, she prefers to be known as her role as Luna here. | think she doesn’t want the ties to that pack. Her blood will make for the strongest potion and make all the human werewolves possible.” “I feel like | am missing something here. So far, you have done great at handling your business. Between the two of you, you have enough men and power on your side. Why do you need us?” “Vin has an uncle that has cinto the picture. This might turn much bigger than us.” “Who is that?” Lars looked atlike | was stupid.

Anthony tossed everything down and : . m shook his head. You preareife stropggstyaoks Who is bigger than ” a you both?” Please read the original content at

“Ever heard of Sir Joe Gambino.” | asked the table.

“Not even close.” | said, looking at him.

“That's an Italian name....” Carson finally said.

“Correct. Sir Joe Gambino is the head of the Italian Mafia family and is Vin's uncle.”

No on said as word as they stared at me. Not moving aninehygn WARE anght sanbask Bid allowed them to accept this reality. Please read the original content at

“The mafia is in the U.S?” Aston asked in a whisper.

















###Chapter 0470

“They are. Not sure how many and what they are capable of. Alec and | had a meeting with Sir Joe...” “You what? You called up the head of the mafia and what, asked to meet up with him? How did you get his number?” Anthony asked.

“Anthony, | am about five seconds from shutting you up.” Carson looked deadly at Anthony. Thankfully, Anthony had the brains to shut up. Carson gave him a few minutes before looking at me. “Continue.” “My informant was killed. Still not sure why who but he was. There is an old man that runs the auctions. Rip used to pay him a hefty amount to keep things.... in his favor. Since he is dead, Vin hasn't kept that up.

Actually, he has bullied and pissed the old man off. At one point, | was following Gunther and ran into this place. So, | called the old man up and told him | would pay him if he started tellingwhen auctions were and for any information. Vin has pissed off a lot of men that used to be allies. So, the old man toldabout Kara being sold. Alec had a man that we put undercover. He got close enough the number air dropped onto his phone. So, yeah. Technically, | did just call him up. Googling the etiquette, | asked for a meeting and with a few request. He stayed up to his end and it was completely civil. At the end, he said he is going to stand by Vin because these wolves would increase his power ability. | told him that | would be declaring war and | wanted to kill Vin.

Basically, we shook hands and said may the best man win.” It wasn’t word for word but that was the gist of it.

“Fuuuck.” Lars put the pictures down and ran his hands through his hair.

“Yeah. | declared war and | can't tell you how many men he has but the longer we wait, the more will come. | made my intentions very clear as did he. The thing is, we don’t know where they are hiding out at. We put a poison in the air system at that castle so other than the dead bodies, they could be anywhere.” “So, they want to kill Penny for her blood.” Aston was wrapping his head around it.

“No, they don’t.” | knew my voice changed as everyone looked at me.

When | didn’t keep going, Alec helpedout. “They want to hold her hostage for continuous blood supply. They want the babies to be raised under their care for their blood.” Hank looked sick. “That's the most fucked up thing | have ever heard.” My jaw was clenched together so tightly, | swear | could hear my teeth cracking. “It isn’t going to happen.” “What do you think you need from us?” Carson asked, shutting his folder.

“I'm not 100% sure since I'm not sure about what it means to go up against the mafia.” Aston stood up and started pacing. “I wasn't even aware the mafia was ran by wolves!” either until we saw him.” “Have you heard from the old man since you saved Kara and my daughter?” Carson asked. His voice made it sound like he had a plan.

“Nope. | didn’t expect to. The event was ruined since none of the girls got there. This literally might be a war againstand the mafia. There is no evidence Rip’s allies are even aligned with Vin. However, they were excited to see the human wolves.” “We need to find where they are even keeping the girls they have captured. Do you have someone you can do sresearch about missing ranking women. They must be from all over, otherwise we would know about more.” Carson was in planning mode.

“That should be our first plan of action. Find their source and take it out.” Lars agreed.

“I have someone that can do the research.” Hank spoke up. He had already pulled out his phone and started shifting through it.

“He is a younger kid but is stupidly good.” Aston grabbed the back of his chair and learned forward. “What about putting anyone under cover or send a team to investigate?” Visit englishto read full content. noveldrama

“Have you really questioned Tanya yet?” Carson asked.

“I mean, we have but not since all this went down. In the beginning yes but that's it.” | halfway forgot about Tanya. She didn’t really give us anything in the beginning.

“If it is okay with you, | would like to fully read each of these reports. Then | would like to question Tanya and everyone that is involved. Even if it seems minimal.” “I have no problem with that. My beta might but I'll talk to him. It might help to have fresh eyes. At this point, I'm not sure if | missed anything.”

“Sounds good. | need ttoo. You took excellent notes so that will be helpful to us up to speed.” Hank followed Carson.

“Alright. Meeting adjourned.” | said, with a weight off my shoulders.












###Chapter 0471

For the last thirty minutes, | have let the hot water run over my back. With my hands on the wall, | just let the water massage my achy back. The stress and anxiety from having every choice | made being analyzed was getting to me.

I've been going over each decision | made, questioning if | did the right thing. So far, | stand by every choice | did but that doesn’t mean there was a better way to go about it. There was no way in hell | was going to sit back and not do everything in my power to protect my family.

Only when the water turned cold, did | turn it off. That was one thing about the pack house verse the house. The house had limited hot water, where the pack house had multiple hot water tanks. It was next to impossible to run out of hot water.

The door opened as | was drying myself off. “How did your meeting go?” Penny leaned against the door frwith her hands crossed over her chest.

“I mean... it went good, | think. They are looking over all the reports and we will meet again tomorrow. | am hoping sof them telltonight they are on board.” “Are sof them not?” “I don't think that is it. Well, maybe for Anthony but the rest just want to be caught up on everything that is going on. Plus, they want to interview Tanya, Sherry and probably Zac. I'm hoping they agree with all my decisions | have made and halfway hoping they see something | missed.” “Why are you hoping for that?” Penny moved out of the way so | could make my way to the bedroom. The costwas laying out across the bed.

“I'm hoping they find something else we can explore so we have a direction but on the other hand, | hope they don't. | want to think | saw everything and was able to do the exact sthing they would have in that position.” The last thing | wanted to do was put this robe on but Penny already had her hair and makeup done. | wasn’t going to ruin this for her. However, I'm sure she could feel my emotions and knew | wasn’t in the mood for a party... not that | had a choice.

“I'm positive you did everything you felt was right in that moment. Everyone rethinks their actions after the fact. It's part of life.” | knew Penny was trying to makefeel better but it wasn't working.


“Are you ready to go?” | asked without looking at her. Refusing to wear just the robe, | put on shorts and a tank before grabbing the robe.

“I'am. Just need to put on my wrap. | need your help for that.” After fixing my robe, | looked at her as | put on the necklace. “Did you get your belly painted?” Penny smiled and opened her robe. The Earth was painted on her belly perfectly. “What do you think?” “That looks really good. Who did that?” “Kris.” Penny dropped her robe and pulled out two pieces of her costume. | was partially surprised with how much skin she was showing but | felt proud of her for it. The top was more like a glorified bra that zipped in the back. It fully covered her but still looked sexy. The skirt was tight around her ass but flowed nicely down to the ground. She had a train. | would say that would make it hard to dance but she wasn’t going to be out there. The white lienen material really captured the Moon Goddess vibes.

Even the greenery in her hair tied it together.

“You look great.” | told her with as much as a smile as | could muster.

“Thanks. Ready go to?” She lookedup and down before handingmy extremely large cane.

“I'am.” She led the way as we walked down the stairs and to the car.

It was about an hour drive so we fell into a comfort silence. She was messaging on her phone as | staying in my head.

Finding the girls would be the next step. Maybe completely taking out the whole operations. If | had the help of these men, we could break up and take it all out. Take out sof the alphas that are involved and who run their packs the way Rip did.

That would be the best outcreally. | wasn't sure if it was possible but it was something worth mentioning to the table. My mind was so preoccupied that we arrived at the venue souly out of memory.

“This place is already filled!” Penny's voice brought my mind back to the present.

She was right. Headlights were covering the valet parking, strings of purple, orange and (egligntsieté!! coyeringednysitace Jack-o-lanterns were carved and lining the doorways. Disco lights were reflecting through the windows as we pulled up. Please read the original

I ” .

Thank you.” | said as | walked around. Opening the door for oli helped her RA theSekicle er Hey Was § large that | wondered how her back felt. Still, she kept a smile on her face as we walked inside.

The lights were turned down low with purple and red lights ran across the ceiling and walls. Monster themed music was playing quietly as people mingled.

“This turned out so great!” Penny gushed.

“Is there a meal?” | asked. | becaware that | haven't actually paid attention to how this event was going to go. noveldrama

« . . a No. Everything is finger foods and being walked around. There is a table with small plates if you Jantacglidn 9s Ciao ks. You need to-ake a small speech but otherwise, it is just a mingle thing.

###Chapter 0472

“You girls did really great!” | was really impressed with it. As we made our way to the head table, multiple people greeted us.

S| knew and s| wasn’t sure due to not being able to see their face. Since everyone over 18 was invited, | didn’t bother with figuring who was who. | only knew the ranking men and women.

“Looking good!” Ice pulled my attention from the Frankenstein D.J.

“Thanks!” Penny posed with her belly. Half way sticking it out and a sexier pose.

“That is quite the shirt.” I had to hide a laugh when | looked at Alec. He was wearing a silk brown shirt with orange and pink flowers. The flare velvet pants really finished off the costume. Ice had put rhinestones all over her stomach. | was afraid to ask how long that took someone to do all that. More so, how long it will take to get all them off.

“Kiss my ass.” Alec grumbled.

“Con! Emmy is over here!” Ice grabbed Penny and they left us to our own devices.

“You should try the amputated fingers.” | wasn’t sure how to respond to that. “What else is there?” “Not sure.” The flow of people slowed down. We didn’t talk but just watched everyone as they mingled. There was laughter and a one group of guys that were fighting but the warriors were quick to respond.

My eyes landed on Penny as she made her way back up to us. “It's tfor you to welceveryone.” “Okay.” The D.J. cup toand handeda microphone.


“I'll turn the music down and then its open for you.” He said before walking away. We watched him walk back to his booth and turn the music down. After a nod, he motioned forto speak.

“Welcevery!” | said very clearly. Instantly, everyone quieted down and looked over at me. “We are so blessed everyone was able to attend our gathering. Hopefully, many mates are found and friendships are formed. There are tables for foods and drinks, otherwise the staff will be walking around with different items. Please enjoy yourself and have fun!” Everyone cheered as | nodded back at the D.J. He turned the music back up and the atmosphere because laughing and fun.

Setting the microphone down, Alec and | just watched as the girls walked off somewhere.

“Jacob, you got the security on high alert? Camera on Penny?” | asked in the mind-link. | haven't seen him yet so | wanted to verbally hear it.

“Roger.” Jacob said and that was it. | was about to cback with something but | saw him approach out of the corner of my eyes. “Everything is good. Just finished my check.” “Good. It will be your head if something happens.” I had to really look at Jacob. If it wasn't for his fangs, | wouldn't be sure what he was. That meant, Emmy probably had a pretend bite mark on her neck with fake blood. “All's good. Enjoy your evening.” “Alpha Colt.” | heard Carson cup to us. He was dressed in tights. He must be Robin Hood and his luna probably was Maid Marian.

“Alpha Carson.” | took his hand he was offering in greeting. “This is my beta Jacob.” “Nice to meet you.” Alpha Carson offered his hand to Jacob.

“It is a pleasure to meet you, Alpha Carson.” Jacob’s whole demeanor changed and he becprofessional. There was a sense of proudness that filledwhen he did that.

“I was coming to see if Alec and Colt wouldn't mind coming to the back for a quick word.” He left it open as a question but it really wasn't.

“Of course. | will just telling him the security is up and running. | have to get back to my post. Enjoy your evening, Alpha Carson.” Jacob gave a slight bow and walked off.

“Where are we going?” | asked as Alpha Carson turned to leave. Alec and | followed him through the crowd.


“Just into this room.” We followed him into a side room. The music instantly dimmed as we walked in and shut the door. All the other alphas were in the room and having an intense conversation.

“What's going on?” | asked. | was suddenly defensive and nervous to what they were going to say.

“My daughter has been able to remember a few details. | had questioned her a little before but this afternoon, she cinfe.myTeofi | #9 tol mest ThE house they re kept at... she might be able to retrace the driving. Apparently, she was able to look out the windshield.

“That would be great. We would need to have a team ready so if she can do it correctly, we can attack immediately.” Anthony said as he slammed his fist on the wall.

“Hold up. We have no intel on security, man power or these wolf things. We can't just send our men in blind.” Lars spoke up. noveldrama

“They could move the girls if we are caught. Taking a team would be helpful in case we don’t have a choice.” Aston wasn’t exactly happy to side with Anthony as he looked atsheeply.

“Either way, this is your call. You are the one in charge and | believe it is your call to make.” Carson filled in.

Penny POV Everything was going perfectly. Everyone was dancing, laughing and just generally having a great time! | kept bouncing between sitting with Kris and Emmy and talking to the other lunas of our allies. If | wasn’t sitting with one of those groups, you could find me in the bathroom. Every five minutes | needed to pee. My boys were having a kick boxing match and | wasn’t sure who was winning.

Needing some fresh breath, | sat on a chair that was near the exit. | had a guard open the door so a breeze was hitting me. Colt was feeling relieved so | hoped that meant he got the news he wanted. However, it was about time for me to go home so his meeting needed to hurry up.

“Oh! Luna!” Someone in a Hulk costume ran up to me.

“What's wrong?” | asked. They were looking around frantically.

“He rejected her! He-he just .... she is dying!” The person in the Hulk costume started tearing up as they looked behind them and into the hallway.

“Oh no! Show me where she is!” The Hulk ran out of the room before | could even stand up. Holding onto the rails, | looked for a guard but they were breaking up a fight. “Well, shit.” | muttered.

My swollen legs carried me out of the party and as | looked left and right, | saw a girl laying on her side in the fetal position. The sounds of her crying her eyes out echoed across the whole hallway.

“Down here!” The Hulk yelled. | could feel the swelling so bad on my feet that they jiggled with each step. Still, | went as quickly as | dared.

Coming closer, | saw she was wearing an all black sheet but it was riding up on her legs. A black and blue bruise stuck out on her shin. “What..” Before | even asked her if she was okay, | had to see the rest of her legs. Getting down on my knees, my hands moved the sheet to see that the rest of her legs didn’t even have a single spot that wasn’t bruised. Some was even yellow from healing.

“I'm so sorry.” The girl was crying.

Looking at her face, her eyes met mine. The regret and sadness in them was clear. “What? What are you sorry for?” Her eyes looked behind me. Instant panic rose in me. Before | could even look, a white cloth pressed against my nose. A sickening sweet burning smell ran up my nose and the room started spinning. Relation that | fell right into their trap was the last thing | thought before complete blackness took over.

“She has a massive bowling ball on her stomach. Do you really think tying her up was going to help?” My head was pounding. Angry voices were yelling so loud that | wished the darkness came back. My arms and legs were in just as much pain as my head. Protesting the same position that | had been in.

Something slammed that echoed so loud that | could barely handle it. My stomach was turning, threatening to empty the snacks | ate. It was only my sheer will-power that | kept anything down.

“Are you awake?” | heard a small girl ask so quietly.

“No.” | groaned.

“Here.” | didn’t open my eyes but | felt her remove the chains from my hands and then from my legs. “You can move now.” Expect, | didn't move. Everything was too worn out. Instead, | just curled into a fetal position and let the blackness take me over again.noveldrama

Three babies were cooing in front of me. As | walked forward, | noticed the blankets that Colt was acting so strangely about. These were my babies. Putting my hand over my stomach, my knees gave out and the tears filled my eyes.

Signs with Elijah Colt, Cooper Brian and Eliana Penelope were laying across their chest. “My babies?” Picking them up, one by one, | held them against my chest.

“My child.” The sweetest voice | ever heard, came from behind me.


Turning, my eyes were blinked by the light until a figure of a women came out. She was walking towards me, ever so lightly. As if she was gliding, she got closer and closer. It wasn’t until she stopped moving and the light died that | realized who she was.

“The Moon Goddess...” | whispered. Panic rose in me as | looked at my babies. “Am | dead? Are...are we dead?” “Oh no, my child. Just sleeping right now. | brought you here to warn you... to prepared you.” “Warn me of what?” Visit english.net to read full content.

###Chapter 0474

This time, | was well aware that | was laying in a lumpy bed. A beeping sound filled my ears before my eyes started opening. At first, | thought | was in a hosptial room. Montiers wrapped around my belly, an I.V. was sticking out of my arm and the smell of bleach filled my nose. It was the concrete walls that gave it away.

“Where am I?” | asked. Looking at a monitor, three separate heart beats blinked, almost in unison.

“That's not important. Do you know who | am?” There was a man in a white coat that was writing on a clip board. The other hand was standing to my right, looking at me. He instant gave me a chills. His black eyes looked at me like a hunter looks at prey.

“No.” | said honestly. | had some suspicions but | didn’t want to talk more than | needed to.

“My name is Vin. I'm sure your mate has talked about me to you.” He must have saw the flash of fear across my eyes as understanding. Instead of answering his own question or statement, he laughed and walked around the end of the bed. “What are you doing to my babies?” “Nothing right now.” The doctor said without looking at me. “They are thriving but still need a little growth. | would say another week or two before they are born.” “Damn, that’s a long time. Can she travel?” Vin asked. His hands were on his hips as he glared at the doctor.

“No. Any air travel will put her at a great risk for a blood clot. If she dies because you put her on a plane, there goes your blood.” The doctor gave him a pointed look before walking out.

| was very much aware of how little clothing | was wearing right now. This is why | didn’t wear revealing clothing.

You just never know what situations you find yourself in.

“Back to you.” Vin picked up a clear bag that was full of blood. “Thank you for this donation. Fortunately for you, | could only take so much because it put the babies at risk. | need everyone healthy but this will make a huge batch of potion.” Tears filled my eyes as | watched him laugh and walk out of my personal torture room. My feet looked like sausages. Every time | tried to move my leg, | couldn't. Leaning forward, | went to feel them but a sharp pull on my back made me stop.

“You have an epidural in. | wouldn't move... unless you want to be paralyzed.” The doctor came back in. He was carrying a bucket with gloves on. Bending down by my bed, it wasn’t until he stood up that | realized he emptied a pee bag. My pee bag. That is when | notice a tub coming out from under my skirt and down the side of the bed.

The feeling of being violated filled me. “I think | am going to throw up.” “Here.” He tossed me a bag and walked out.

After emptying the contents of my stomach, a soft hand took it from me. “I'm nurse Rosalie. | put the catheter in.

Don’t worry, no man has touched you inappropriately.” “Thank you.” | said quietly. She tossed my vomit bag in the trash and grabbed a rag. Running it under the sink, she came over and whipped my forehead with it.

“I've been imprisoned here for most of my life. They forced me to go to medical school.” My eyes looked at her arms. They were covered in finger print bruises as well as her neck.

A loud bang sounded outside the door, making her jump. “I have to go. I'll be back with food for you.” Gathering up her supplies, she walked out and closed the door behind her.

###Chapter 0475

Colt POV My literal worst nightmare was playing before my eyes. How | managed to not kill everyone last night was a personal accomplishment that | felt like | should be getting thanked for. Jacob, my beta, the man that was in charge of the security was sitting in front of me with one black eye, broken nose and how I didn’t break his jaw | wasn't sure. Probably because | got pulled off him before | could keep going.

All the alphas were in my office, discussing out next steps. At this point, all my give a fucks were broken. | didn’t give a shit if Sherry wanted to talk or not. | will be putting her under command and forcing it. If Tanya didn’t walk, | would be killing her today. The time has come for answers and if they didn’t want to give them to me, | was going to kill anyone who just annoyed me.

The only thing | had going for me was the fact they weren't going to kill Penny. They wanted her blood. By keeping her alive, they would get more blood and the doctor assured me | still had some time before the babies were born. Unless they cut them out of her, she should be pregnant for a little longer.

With my head in my hand, | was twirled my chair. Watching the men discuss what they were going to say or ask the girls. Alec just arrived and told me Tanya was outside the office when we were ready.

| watched Jacob stand up and walk to the office door. “Bring her in.” He commanded. The guard brought her in and forcefully made her sit in the chair in front of me. The room got quiet as she looked around but there wasn’t an ounce of fear in her eyes.

Leaning forward, | got to it. “I want answers.” | knew my voice was dangerously calm. Even since Penny was taken, my wolf hasn't allowed me to push him back. My eyes were black and there was a little roughness to each word | said.


“I don’t know what you want me to say. All | know is what was going on when Rip was alive.” Tanya leaned back and crossed her arms.

Snapping my fingers, two men came froward and forced her arms on the arm rest. As much as she fought, she failed. The fight in her eyes changed to anger as she looked at the men. “After all the torture | endured, you can’t do anything to me.” “What do you know about Darin stealing humans?” There was a moment of recognition before she covered it up quickly. “No idea.” Glancing over at Carson and Aston, they proceeded to grab a finger and snap it back. The sound of her finger breaking was music to my ears but she just clenched her teeth other and didn’t scream out. “If you tell me what I want to know, I'll just kill you quicker. You can either go out in pain or make it easy. There many unimportant bones that can break and reform for me to break again.” “Fuck off.” She spit. | didn’t even have to look at them for them to break another one. “SHIT!” Now, her eyes kept looking at her fingers. Still just filled with anger, but maybe a hint of panic.

“Honestly, | already know they were kidnapping humans. | want to know where they took them.” “Fine! They took them to a castle in the woods! Okay? | don’t know where it is. It wasn’t like | was privy to that information.” “Try harder. We already found that.” Carson and Aston took it upon themselves to break another finger on each hand. noveldrama

“I honestly don’t know! | was just someone to fill their bed.” “Unfortunately for you, | don’t believe you.” Leaning back in my chair, | folded my hands together. “Even if you believe it is irrelevant, | want to know it.” “I honestly don’t know! They would be gone for a few days at a time and come back and talk about how their hunting was successful. Then, they would have to go it again a week later. | don’t know anything else!” “| still think you are holding out.” Carson and Aston broke the last four fingers. A thin line of sweat formed on her forehead.

“I swear!” She still had the fight in her eyes. Until that was gone, | wasn’t going to be satisfied.

“Did they ever talk about how they got the humans?” “Fuck, | don’t remember!” She rolled her eyes at me. This time Carson and Aston wrapped their hand around her wrist and squeezed until there was multiple snaps.

This time, Tanya cried out. “Try again.” | said as her screamed died down.

As painful as it was to not physical punch her till she was dead, | needed answers. Alec Pad seat fis a 180 {rig For Basically anything.

Following the road the vans came in that we intercepted, | just prayed they find something.

“Did they ever go into another state?” “I. Don’t. Know!” Tanya leaned forward and stared at me as she said each word like it was it’s own sentence.

This time, it was her forearm that broke. Each finger was pointed upward and at a funny angle, her hand was just laying downward with no movement and now her arm was so badly snapped that it was even angled upward.

###Chapter 0476

"All I know is they said they needed an area for training. The humans they did transform were getting additional training. Plus, they needed to hunt. Their diet is larger than ours and they only eat animals. Look for a stupid forest or something."

Tanya's head fell back against the chair. Closing her eyes, she focused on her breathing. Looking around the room, I waited to see if anyone else had any questions but they shook their head no.

Looking at Carson, he just nodded. Standing up, he stood right in front of her. With either hand on the sides of her face, he snapped her neck cleanly. Her body went lip, almost falling out of the chair.

"Get her out of here and Jacob, get Sherry in here.” Leaning back, the warrior by the door instantly jumped up and grabbed Tanya. Tossing her over his shoulder, he carried her out. A second later, a shaking Sherry walking quickly and sat down.

"Alpha." She bowed low and kept her eyes looking downward. I wasn't sure if Jacob told her to do that but I didn't give a shit either way.

"I am commanding you to answer all of Alpha Carson's questions fully and to the best of your knowledge." There was no point in asking if she understood, she was in my pack and therefore had no choice in the matter.noveldrama

"Sherry, I understand you were mated to Cash before being mated to Jacob." Alpha Carson started.

Sherry was clearly uncomfortable but kept her back straight. "Yes, Alpha. That was my fate."

"Did you ever hear them talk about more locations to where they would go?" Alpha Carson stood to the side, making Sherry turn her head to look at him.

"There was a few times I was cleaning and would hear them walk by and would be talking. I don't have really anything concrete. I know they mentioned a vacation house in the state over but I couldn't even tell you where it was or which state."

There wasn't a reason to torture her since she was under my command. "Where you forced to go with any males to a location in the woods?" "Um... one time I went to this really old looking house in the woods. They forced me to clean up the basement. There was blood and all sorts of stuff everywhere."

Alpha Carson looked at me. Nodding in response, he kept going. "What happened in the basement?"

"Massacre." Sherry closed her eyes and shook her head. "There was a few girls that hadn't died yet so I put them out of their misery. Otherwise, they would have just buried them alive."

"They might have started their experiments there and then after that, moved to a different location." Aston said out loud.

Sherry's head snapped up. "Experiments?" Her eyes quickly looked at me before snapping back down at the floor.

"What do you know about experiments?" Carson asked with zero remorse to his voice. I might actually kill anyone who shows any sympathy right now. Jacob included. He was standing be the door with his arms over his chest. His wolf was begging to come out and protect his mate. Thankfully, Jacob kept him in check.

"I don't know anything about an experiment but there was one time that Darin stormed into Cash and I's room. He was beyond mad. Apparently, Cash didn't secure something and they got into the city." Sherry shrugged and looked questioningly at Carson. "Not sure if that helps or not."

"Anything else?" Aston asked.

"No. After Darin saw me, I got a beaten and told not to tell anyone what I heard and they left. I was in the hospital for a week."

It was then that I had a thought. Why I hadn't thought about this yet but I instantly shot up. They wanted blood and probably took some of Sherry's with or without her knowledge but if they were looking for powerful female blood, they just had to go down the their cells.

"Sherry, I want you to go get Cassie and bring her here to me now." I commanded.

Sherry, instantly stood up and practically ran out of the room. "I wasn't done questioning her." Alpha Carson said, with a little tone.

"They wanted blood, right? Powerful female blood." I looked at everyone but only Alec stepped forward.

"That's why they kept her alive." He said, his eyes were wide with the same realization as I had.

"Who?" Lars asked.

"Cassie. Penny's mother." I said as I leaned back in my chair.

"I forgot she was alive." Aston said quietly.

"She is but she isn't all there." Jacob said without moving. "I have had multiple reports of her saying off the wall stuff and it not making sense. She often talks like she is still a little girl, before she had Penny."

"Penny said the same thing to me." It physically hurt to say Penny's name. Even more than to hear her name come out of Jacob's stupid mouth. Truthfully, all the alpha's had guards covering the place. How they managed to get Penny out still confuses the fuck out of me. Regardless, the events of last night are being investigated right now.

"Alpha Colt!" Cassie came floating in with a huge smile on her face. After walking around and shaking everyone's hand, she sat down and crossed her legs. "What can I do for you?"

"Cassie, you are aware your daughter was kidnapped?" I couldn't bring myself to say her name again.

"I am but I have faith you will bring her home again. After all, it is your destiny."

"How is it my destiny?" I asked, confused.

"All those years of being in that cell, I kept telling myself that Penny was going to find a powerful man to protect her. I think she did!" Cassie smiled at me and pointed her finger.

"Did they ever take your blood while you were in the cell?" Cassie tossed her head back and laughed.



















###Chapter 0477

“They tried to take everything frombut they did not get it! My dignity will always be in tact!” “Cassie, your BLOOD!” | bellowed dangerously, forcing her to bow her head.

Her neck twitched as | watched you submit, even though she tried to resist. “Yes, they took my blood for awhile but stopped.” “When did they stop?” Alpha Carson asked.

“Alpha Colt, there wasn’t a single t| could look at a calender. Everything blended together. There isn’t a concept of twhen you are chained to a wall, naked and starved. At first, you try to count but then you go by seasons. How many cold times did | think | was finally going to succumb to it? Eventually, you even lose tract of season and just pay one of the days it will eventually take you out.” Cassie just looked atlike | was stupid.

Even after commanding her, she couldn't answer me. “Did you ever hear anything about experiments?” | kept my command around her.

“No. | started to draw pictures in the dirt when | got bored.” Cassie smiled at the memory. “Did you know that | used to draw all the twhen | was younger? Colored pensils and something even oils!” She looked around the room, smiling at the men.

They gave the sexpression, sympathy with a little bit of annoyance sprinkled in. Part ofthought | might be able to get a little something out of her but | would have to control my anger and ask the perfect questions.

Penny POV “If I knew it was going to be this easy to take blood, | would have known to make all the females get an epidural.” Vin was standing by the foot of my bed as the doctor filled a bag full of my precious blood.

“It's astonishing how little you respect the lives of women.” Folding my arms over my chest, | couldn't do anything but watch them do whatever they wanted to my legs. Apparently, | had a great vein in my

leg that made it very easy to use.


“After | finish making this round of potion, | have already collected enough humans that we will be able to set up an attack on your stolen pack lands!” Vin narrowed his eyes atand gavean evil smirk.

My jaw dropped. After being kidnapped, | assumed the security would be incredibly strong. However, | thought it already was from when | was kidnapped. “Speaking of which, how did you kidnap me?” “Shit...” Vin rolled his eyes as he looked at the doctor mess with the almost full bag.

“Was it not your idea? Is that why you can't tell me?” | hoped by gloating that it would entice him to tell me.

Vin didn’t answer but took three steps over toand backhandedso quickly that | wasn’t prepared for it. My head snapped so hard to the left that it cracked more that | thought it should.

| was so stunned. Not once had | been hit before. Tears automatically filled my eyes as | felt the blood run down my chin. Anger and embarrassment filledas | tried to gather myself before looking at him.

“Watch your mouth, woman. The only reason you haven't been harmed yet was because of these babies. Once they are born, they can’t save you. You will never see them again after | cut them from you.” “Vin. You have so much to learn about treating people with respect.” A new male voice entered the room. | was vaguely aware of the doctor putting a piece of tape on my leg after pulling the needle out. noveldrama

“Uncle, sh...” “I don’t care. She is a heavily pregnant women who is completely incapable of moving. Does it make you feel like a man to strike someone like that?” My brain registered two things. One, this was Vin’s uncle and therefore not someone that was going to help me. Second, this must be the man that Colt met with. | had overheard Colt tell the men that he has morals... even if he was a criminal.

“What are you doing here?” Vin asked with a clear attitude.

“Here.” Something tickled the back of my hand. Peaking through my wet eyelashes, | saw a white handkerchief dangling in front of me.

“Thank you.” My hand shook as | took the handkerchief and cleaned off my lip.

“Do you know who | am?” He asked, softly.

Finding the courage, | was able to turn toward him. “No.” | said as | looked at the man in front of me. Swould say he was handsbut his eyes were just as dark as Vins.

“I am Sir Joe Gambino. | am the head of the Italian Mafia and uncle to Vin. | also had a meeting with your mate about you.” “Yes. He declared war because you want to take my blood forcefully.” My voice was shaking even though I tried sounding strong.

This must have amused him because he raised an eyebrow SHE and (1 Ager eave [did offer a his ground but he was unwilling.” Please read the original content at

“Colt will cfor me.” “Yes. Yes, he will.” Sir Joe nodded in agreement.

“He has to find us first.” Vin laughed.

Sir Joe sighed and fought hard to not roll his eyes. “You have little faith in our enemy.” “Why do you?” Vin retorted.

“I'm sorry, where is your alpha?” The words were out of my mouth before they even registered in my mind.

My hand jerked as | wanted to cover my mouth in shock but | forced myself to keep my head held high.

Sir Joe tossed his head back and laughed as Vin had steam coming from his ears. He resenyleda Of! lu in balls. His elbows were locked and his shoulders were slightly raised. The whole thing | found funny to even look at. Please read the original content at










###Chapter 0478 

"Vin. Go cool off." Sir Joe said still laughing.

Vin just glared at me a moment longer. He had opened his mouth like he wanted to say something but eventually shut it and stormed out of the room. Unfortunatly, he took the blood bag with him.

"I apologize for my nephew's level of disrespect. He has much to learn in this world."

"He may not get the chance to do that." I said, letting out a sigh of relief since Vin was gone.noveldrama

"Colt is insistent on his death." Sir Joe agreed.

"He kidnapped me. If there wasn't a target on his head before, there is one there now."

“Again, we did offer to have you voluntarily give us blood."

"Why do you even want to be part of this? You realize that when Colt comes, everyone will be in their cross hairs. That means you and your men. "Well. You see, I liked Colt. His attitude and the respect he showed me by asking for not only a meeting but a chance to settle this without going to war. Now, Vin is my blood so his problems are my problems. However, he is making many mistakes. So, by coming here, to your rescue, might earn me some bonus points."

"From what I know, just because he is your blood doesn't make his intentionally started problems yours. You could have turned around and got back on a plane. Instead, you chose to help him. Which, I am assuming you are part of how I got kidnapped in the first place."

"I won't deny his problems do intrigue me. They will get me advancement in Italy so therefore, I am interested. However, that doesn't involve the killing of innocent pure alpha females. I'm here to make a deal with you. I'll keep Vin off your back if you behave while you are here. Allow the doctor to do what is needed and I'll make sure you are in a comfortable bed with edible food. The babies will stay with you and no physical pain will be inflicted."

"What is the catch?" There always was one.

He lifted his lip and smirked. "Smart girl. The catch is I will take everything away in a heart beat. If you refuse to allow the doctor to do what is needed, the babies will be taken from you. You will be placed in a cement cell is rat food. Just enough to keep you alive for us to forcefully take your blood. These babies can be evicted at anytime. You can either go till they are ready to come out or I can arrange for them to be taken out today. You will never see them again. They will be on a plane to Italy in the matter of hours."

"Do you expect me to beg Colt to spare your life when he comes because you are showing me some comfort while I am in prison?"

"“No. I can assure my own safety. This is more of a personal moral high ground that I refuse to allow anyone to bend. Can I assume we have a deal?” "My babies will stay with me? I'll be able to carry them till they are ready to come out and no harm will be done to them?"

"Correct." Sir Joe nodded his head.

"No harm shall come to me? Vin will stay away and everyone else too?" I asked for clarification.

"Well, the doctor and nurse will come tend to your needs." I didn't answer right away. "Either way, keeping an epidural isn't going to be an option. It will be gone tonight."

"No blood will be taken from my babies." I stated. It wasn't a question but a statement.

"Until you prove invaluable, the babies will be protected. Besides, your blood will be stronger than theirs until you die." Sir Joe turned to leave. "Fine! I'll take your deal. However, when I am rescued, the deal will be moot since I will no longer be here."

Sir Joe turned and looked at me. There was a sparkle in his eyes that made me seriously question if I made the right decision. It almost sounded too good to be true. "Obviously."

As soon as he shut the door, a stray tear ran down my face. I just wanted my babies safe. As soon as my hand started rubbing my belly, my innocent little babies started kicking away.

"Mommy loves you and will do anything to protect you." I whispered. I wasn't sure what Colt was doing at this very moment but I hoped he was on his way to me. Surely, Gunther or Kara would have some information they could share.

A small laughter raised up from my stomach. I had just hoped fucking Gunther would be able to save me. The same man we faked his death. How the tables have turned. Though, saving me would ensure safety from Vin. I was almost 100% positive that Colt would fully protect anyone who would have able to save me. If not for me, for our children that were inside of me.

"I hear you are springing out!" The doctor came in. His yellow teeth really completed his Dr. Evil vibe he had going on. There wasn't anything comforting about him. Just creepiness.

Thankfully, the nice nurse came in. Her name wasn't coming to me at the moment. "Apparently."

"I'm going to take your catheter out." The nurse said.

"While she does that. I am going to start unhooking you. Once we get into the bedroom, you will be hooked back up. It has been converted into a partial delivery room so everything I will need is in there."

"Is there an actual bed?" If I was going to be stuck in a room that doubled as a hospital prison, I wanted to be comfortable.

"Queen size and I put a pregnancy pillow in there for you. The bathroom is stocked with everything you could want." The nurse gave me a small smile.













###Chapter 0479

Colt POV

"Is Gunther awake yet?" Alpha Lars asked.

"No." Cassie just left. Jacob was in charge of extracting all the information out of her as possible. How he was going to do that wasn't my concern. "Is it a medical induced coma?"

"What are you getting at?" Alpha Hank asked.

"Wake his ass up. I don't give a shit how it affects him. He's lucky to be alive and he has his mate. Wake his ass up and get the answers that you need."

The thought really hasn't occurred to me but after he said it, I was all for it. "Colt.. you ca-" Anthony started but I had jumped to my feet already. "Let's go."noveldrama

No one dared argue with me. Walking right past everyone else, I made my way to the hospital. Regardless of their feelings, they followed me. Even if it kills him, I will wouldn't care.

"Alpha Colt?" A nurse did a double take as I stormed in. The door bounced off the wall hard enough that it should have shattered. Somehow, it didn't. Ignoring her, we went straight to the stairs and went to the second floor. "Alpha Colt." The guard greeted me before his eyes looked behind me. His eyebrows buried but he didn't question me.

"Go get the doctor that has been on this case." I commanded.

"No need. He is inside already." The guard said instantly.

The wood on the door protested as I turned the handle to push it open before it was even ready to be moved. "Doctor, wake him up."

The doctor did a double take as we walked in. Kara, who was standing off to the side, coward back from my aura. "Alpha Colt? Do what?" He was writing on a clipboard but stopped.

"I want to ask him questions, wake him up now."

"Alpha Colt, if I did that, his brain might start swelling again. He co-"

"I don't care if he fucking dies, wake him up. Have you forgotten your Luna is missing and he might have the information needed to save her?" The doctor frowned but did as I asked. "B-but Colt..." Kara said timidly. A very deep, threatening growl ran up my throat as I looked over at her. “Alpha Colt. Please."

"I have questions for you both. Don't forget you aren't innocent in this either." My voice was so low and calm sounding that Kara was visibly shaking. Thankfully, she had the common sense to shut up and take a step away from me but closer to Gunther. "I'll warn you doctor, I can wake him up but if the pressure raises, I'll have to put him back under. You may have a few minutes at best."

"Do it." I said instantly. The other alphas had moved either around the room or made a line around me. My arms were folded as the doctor pushed in a milky looking liquid into his I.V.

"Give it a second." The doctor said and took a step back. He set down that syringe and grabbed another one.

"Gunther?" Kara grabbed his hand and looked at him. The whole display made me want to grab Kara and throw her against the wall.

"Kara?" Gunther's shaking voice sounded weak and unsure.

"You're alive." Kara broke down crying as she rested her head against his hand.

"Move." I demanded. Kara let go of him and moved to the other side of the bed.

"Colt?" Gunther tried to open his eyes but was failing.

"Vin took Penny. Where would he take her?" The urgency of my words even surprised me.

"What?" Gunther tried to comprehend what I was saying. His hand reached up and touched his head.

"Vin took Penny. Where would he take her?" I repeated myself.

"His....family...brother.... no." Gunther tried to form the right word but was failing at it. The monitors started beeping. "Family house."

"They are at a family owned house?" I tried to understand what he was saying before the doctor shut me down.

"Baby. It's okay." Kara put her arm around his chest. It helped calm him down a little but he clenched his hair.

"Road...follow... it's... AAARRR." Gunther screamed out in pain.

"That's it!" The doctor pushed Kara out of the way and pushed the medicine in.

"Hurry!" Gunther said before his body relaxed under the medicine.

"DAMNIT!" I roared in agony.

"Kara, what happened after the incident at the castle?" Carson asked.

Kara was crying on Gunther's chest. When Carson asked the question, she looked up at him. With a tear stained face, she sat up and looked at him. "What?"

"After you guys ran off from the castle when Colt invaded it." Carson clarified.

"We didn't leave the castle..." Kara looked at Carson and then back at me.

"What do you mean?" My body froze at this.

"I physically watched you run after Vin." Alec interjected.

"No, you watched people who looked looked like us. Earlier that day, they found the tracking devices you put under our tongues. They extracted them out and put them in someone else. The plan was to have them hide out in the woods. I made a mistake that costed us everything."

"What happened?" I asked, not fully shocked but I was.

"We were at dinner and Vin kept asking me questions. He asked things like how did Gunther and I meet and where we want to live. I couldn't handle the pressure. Vin had grabbed my arm and twisted, forcing me to tell him. They tied me down and searched my entire body before they found the tracker. That's why I didn't wake up when you came into our room. I was knocked out. Gunther had just gotten back. Vin held him down and found the tracker as you guys started invading them. Shoving the trackers in a random girl and a warrior, they we sent out. I woke up later. We were both tied to a chair. Gunther took all the abuse as I cracked under the pressure.”


















###Chapter 0480

“Where was this?” | asked.

“I don’t know. We were blind folded and | was so scared. Gunther was dying and I... | don’t know. Next thing | know is | was being shoved into a cell to be sold. They laughed as they did this because they thought Gunther was going to die and | would die soon after. They thought they were paying their portion withjust forto die.” “What do you mean? Pay your portion?” “To be part of the auction, you have to provide women. The more women you provide, the more say you have in things. Rip apparently used to run the whole thing because he would supply all the women. Gunther said he kept doing this so he would make all the other alphas do what he wanted.” “If Vin is supplying girls that end up dying or are damaged, he will be pissing people off.” Carson supplied.

“That is until these wolves cinto play. Doesn't matter who he fucks over, he will be in charge of everything.” Hank added.

“Probably why is uncle is here. Trying to run the business.” Alec stated.

“What if he wanted to start a branch of the mafia over here?” Carson supplied.

“That mafia boss guy? He never hurt me. He toldhe likes to gamble because there was always drunk guys around to offer money to.” Kara grabbed a tissue and blew her nose before standing up a little straighter.

“You spoke with him?” | asked, more curious.

“He offeredto get Gunther medical treatment if | would just tell him what | knew. He promisedhe would help Gunther. So, | told him | what | knew. Which, wasn’t much since it wasn't like you toldanything. It was more that Gunther was suppose to tell you information. However, after that, | never saw Gunther again until now. The other girls toldthat he would make deals but unless the terms are in black and white, there was always fine print.” “Damn.” Lars shook his head.

“You said Penny was taken? The other girls said that it was better to reject his offers, regardless of how appeasing they sound. It is never in your favor.” | wasn’t sure why her words madefeel uneasy but something intoldhe would probably offer Penny something.

Knowing Penny, she would do anything that meant keeping the babies alive. Even if it meant her death.

“Let's go to your office.” Carson said after a moment of silence.

“If you think of anything else that might help us, letknow.” | commanded and walked out of the room.

With less urgency, we walked back to my office. It made sense about the casino. If he was working out of one, there would be an endless supply of women and men to use to experiment with... or sell.

Walking into my office, | had just sat down when someone shut my door. “Do you guys think he is working out of the casino?” Lars asked, mirroring my thoughts.

“It's possible. Gunther kept saying family. Maybe he was talking about Gambino.” “What did he mean, follow the what?” Anthony asked.

“Probably follow the road but not sure which road he was talking about.” Carson shrugged and sat down in an arm chair.

Alec was pacing around. “He kept saying family. What if it was a family hof Vin or Gambino. Maybe there is an old hthey owned.” “We will need to look into that.” Hank agreed. “What do we think is imminent though?” “What are you getting at?” Jace asked, speaking up for the first time.

“I mean, these wolves. Do you think he is planning on an attack or something soon?” Hank looked around to see if we agreed or not.

“He hasn't retaliated yet. That means it is coming and at what level, | have no idea.” Aston had no hesitation or uncertainty in his voice.

“So we need to be prepared for anything. We all need to make arrangements and make this our top priority.” Jace forcefully put his fist down on the back of the armchair. It was more of a statement action that anything.


“Agreed. Let's all go back to our rooms. Figure your pack out and bring all available men here. Friis) t big fen [BGS This is lik than just Colt and Penny.

Which is enough excuse to get involved but he was right to declare war.” Carson took charge, which | was thankful for.

| knew this was my rodeo but | couldn't really think straight. Maybe | could and | was makin all the @ight yay rs to ground me, | have felt more flustered.

Having her around really calmed me.

Right now, | could punch everyone in this room and not care.

“Colt, if you could arrange another alpha meeting with supper, we can discuss plans moving forward.” Aston stated, as he looked at me. My wolf bristled at someone tellingto do anything but Aston wasn’t wrong and | was going to say that anyway.

“Sure.” That was all | could say, otherwise it would have been more colorful.

In a single file line, they all left my office. “Jacob.” | said over the mind-link.

“Just a second. | am almost to your office.” Jacob's voice sounded like he was excited about something.

A minute ticked by. Then another and another. It was almost ten minutes later and two broken pensils that | was about to go find the mother fucker when the office door opened.

“I got sinformation out of Cassie.” Jacob seemed like he was out of breath.

“Do tell.” The sarcasticness in my voice was hard to miss.

Jacob's body froze for a second before continuing to sit down in front of me. “It's an art form to questign( her. ASLRTOY Borima nd on Hedi gb er to focus. Sherry told that Penny told her that Cassie's brain isn't functioning properly. You can't just command her and expect her to answer the right way.” noveldrama

“I don't fucking care. What did she say?” My temper was coming to the surface.














###Chapter 0481

“I'm not sure if it means anything but she said she has met with Sir Joe Gambino many times. According to her, they are old friends. | guess she liked when he cto visit because she got to get out of the cell, cleaned up and wear clothing. However, she would get a beating afterward because she didn’t keep her mouth shut and it would cause problem.” “Seriously?” “Yup. I'm not sure. She kept talking about large rose bushes and how hot it was. They would travel and she got to sit with windows. | think she meant she wasn't shoved into the trunk but she always got put back in the cells after.” “Did she ever try to escape?” “When | asked that, she said there was a thorn halos around but they smelled so good.” “I don't know what that means.” | confessed.

either. However, she did say she was in a place that was very noisy.” Jacob got a smirk on his face as he said that.

“A casino is noisy.” My mind was racing.

“Bingo. | don’t want to say they are doing these experiments out of the casino but they might be using it as a front or a meeting space. Just how we met up with Gambino. If Rip took her to a dinner there with him...” Jacob trailed off.

“That's interesting. They couldn't be too far from that. Transporting that many people wouldn't be the easiest.” Grabbing my phone, | dialed Alec’s men that were driving around.

“Who are you calling?” Jacob asked. His yellowing face was covered in confusion.

“Yeah.” He answered.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“Go to the casino and do ssurveillance. | want someone undercover in there. Just get the layout and don’t go too risky on me. | am thinking they are taking drunk people for experiments and what not. There might be a house or castle near by that they could be using.” “Maybe an abandoned building?” “Yeah, do you have something?” | asked as my hope soared.

“Not yet. We pulled up the logs on ownership of different buildings in this area. Letdo sdigging.” He said and hung up quickly.

“What now?” Jacob looked like he wanted direction but | didn’t have any.

Shrugging, | was at a loss for words. It's not like | could go home. The place was empty. The only thing that filled it was memories of Penny and the life we were building. If | went home, | would probably only smash everything. noveldrama

Jacob stood up and started walking to the door before stopping. He turned and looked atwith pity in his eyes before he spoke. “I'll figure out the dinner arrangements. Just be down there in two hours.” After | didn’t respond, he walked out the door. Softly, he closed it behind him. | was just... lost. Sitting around feeling sorry for myself wasn’t going to do it but | already had men out looking. We needed information and right now, | didn’t have any worth any value.

| wasn’t sure how long | sat there but a soft knock sounded on my door. Not wanting company, | tried to ignore it but after about five minutes, the door handle shook and the door opened.

“Can | cin?” Alpha Carson stuck his head in.

“Does it matter what | say?” He was already half way in by the t| even spoke.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

Smirking, he shook his head. “Not really but | was trying to be respectful.” “I thought we were meeting for supper?” | wasn't in the mood for a heart to heart. By this time, | started twirling my chair out of habit than anything else. With my head in my hand, I just watched him get comfortable in my arm chair.

“I think you are handling this perfectly.” Alpha Carson started.

“Wonderful.” The sarcasm wasn’t missed by him.

“I'm serious. If you were me, half of this office would be destroyed by now.” Carson folded his arms over his chest.

“Great... listen. I'm not in the mood for a pat on the back for doing what | should be doing when my heavily pregnant mate gets kidnapped.”


“That's not why | am here. Though, | was trying to make you feel like just because your dad was gone, docs mean you are along kis. Kriow he thOghEydU @verything you need to know but nothing replaces having your dad when you are going through a difficult time. Politics aside, | am here for you if you need it.

Completely off the record, of course.” Please read the original content at .

That madefeel both uncomfortable and comforted at the stime. “Why are you hear?” | asked after clearing my throat.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

Sitting up, | placed my elbows on the desk, trying to seem like | actual gave a fuck.

“My daughter is ready to retrace her steps. Ctomorrow morning, we can leave before the sun is up and see if we can find what is around there.” “That would be incredibly helpful.” | was

surprised and pleased by this.

“I do have a question | wanted to ask but not in front of the others.” It was Carson's turn to shift uncomfortably.

“What is it?” Not sure | wanted to know.

“Penny took over the Alpha title. If Vin was part of that pack, can't she just command them to listen to her and let her go?”

“Honestly, she never wanted any part of that. | doubt she even thought about that. However, most of them left the pack after Ripdefcandéut tiesy! doubtVi ea considered part of that pack. Additonally, Joe is not part of the pack and she has no control over them. Even if she could control Vin and the men, Joe probably wouldn't let her just walk out or make the men fight.” Please read the original content at .

“She didn’t want any part of being an Alpha?” Carson clarified.

“No. I'm surprised she even still holds the title.” Penny was a sweet, gentle soul.

“Well, let's head down to the meal. [ll let the guys know we are going t9¢p that tomorrow, ftey tha ee) ighireablt the next course of action.” Carson stood up, slapping his hands on his thighs as he did so. Please read the original content at .

“Yeah.” | wasn’t sure what to say. Penny had the biggest heart and very little room in her heart for anger.

















###Chapter 0482

Penny POV “This will be your new living quarters.” The nurse opened a door on the right. The hallway looked like something out of the movies. The dark green carpet remindedof a hotel. Random statues and paintings hung on the walls with the occasional mirror.

Going into the room, | was in awe with out welcoming it all felt. The door opened up into a living room. Two full sized couches sat facing each other with a glass coffee table in the middle. An electric fireplace danced against the wall.

A smaller kitchen was adjacent with a full fridge. The white and grey thscreamed money and elegance. A half bath was just outside the kitchen. On the other side of the livingroom was two larger bedrooms with a Jack and Jill bathroom. The double vanities were separate from the steam shower and toilet. Stark white sheets were welcoming but it was the basic floral paintings that really toldhow neutral this place actually was.

“Food will be served in about twenty minutes. It would be best if | could get you to sit down and relax on the couch. Putting your feet up would be helpful.” “That's fine.” | said with a little bit of happiness. It almost felt wrong to want to enjoy squiet tin this room.

As | sat down, she put two pillows under my legs and positioned a pillow under my head. After handingthe remote, she brought over smoniters to check my blood pressure.

| was vaguely aware of her being extra close towhile she took it off but it wasn’t until she whispered that | paid attention.

“They are listening and watching.” | almost asked what she said but my mouth stayed shut. Instead, | just gave her a smile and flipped through the channels.

After she put a glass of water and sfresh fruit on the coffee table, she stood up and looked around. “The doctor will be by tomorrow to get more blood.” “Tomorrow?” | asked, concerned.

“Yes. You need to eat up to keep your strength.” After givinga small smile, she just walked out of the room, shutting the door quietly behind her. It wasn’t until | heard the click of the lock that | felt like a prisoner.

“Did | make a mistake?” | asked my babies as | rubbed my belly.

Right as | asked that question, the T.V flickered to a different screen. Thinking | pushed a button, | tried to use the remote to change it back but nothing worked.

“Good morning.” A voice said on the T.V. “Wake up, Gunther.” My body froze as my eyes slowly raised up to look at the T.V. The camera moved so | could see two people sitting in chairs, tied in chains. They were facing each other but it was the face of Gunther that | could see. My heart started racing as | kept watching.

“DON'T TOUCH HIM!” Kara's voice screamed through the speakers.

This couldn't be real. Gunther and Kara were in the hosptial at my pack... right? SLAP! A male back handed Kara so hard that | cold see something flying off to the side. Her head snapped over and her feet started to wiggle.

“Hit me. Not her.” Gunther finally raised his head and looked at Kara. The camera zoomed in on Gunther’s face. The love and care was evident.

“The mighty Gunther, weakened by a girl.” Vins voice causedto interally retract.

“Fuck you, Vin.” Gunther rolled his eyes and the camera backed off his face just in tto see Vin deliver a few punches to Gunther.

My stomach turned, threatening to spill everything | had left in mem ) - ) couldn't watchs Gubsn tmy hing Althbagh interrogations were ) q needed, | wasn't the person for it.

“Yes.” Kara was sobbing at this point. “I'll tell you anything, just don’t hurt Gunther anymore.” “Did you betray me?” Vin asked. noveldrama

wg: ) ” | didn't betray you.” Kara started.

Before she really finished: Guynthr(} . : ) Plregrne SURINES to Gunther's “ » : S hash. STOP!" Kara thrashed in her chair.

“I said don't lie to me!” Vin roared.

“I didn’t betray you! | was never on your team to betray you!” Kara yelled at Vin in a moment of defiance.











###Chapter 0483

“So, you didn’t have a deal with Zac? He wasn't going to adjust what you stole from Colt's office so | was given the wrong information?” Vin challeneged.

“I did but that still doesn’t mean | betrayed you! All | wanted to do was get Gunther out. | did sneak into Colt's office. | didn’t know at the tthat he was aware ofdoing it and planted wrong stuff!” “That costed us so much! We were so close but had to back out because of you!” Vin screamed and delivered multiple punches to Gunther's face and chest.

“I DIDN'T KNOW!" Kara cried as she watched her mate get beaten up. After Vin was done, Gunther spit sblood on the floor and his body went limp. Still, his head rolled from side to side.

“You lead Colt to the Mountain Side Castle.” Vin declared. noveldrama

“Unknowningly.” Kara's defiance was something to be proud of.

“What are Colt’s plans?” Vin asked.


“I don't fucking know! | wasn’t invited to his private meetings.” Kara glared at Vin.

Vin sighed. “I really hoped we could avoid this.” He walked out of the camera range and cback with a baseball bat.

Instantly, | knew what he was going to do. My stomach turned as | threw up on the carpet. As hard as | tried to ignore the sounds of metal hitting Gunther's head, | couldn't. Each the made contact, my body spasmed and threw up.

Colt POV “Good. It's about tyou arrived.” Carson glared at Anthony as he was the last Alpha to walk in.

“I'm sorry | had to finalize plans.” Anthony glared at Carson.

“Tomorrow, Colt, Hank and myself are leaving with my daughter to see if she can retrace her steps. Alec will stay here and be in charge awhile Colt is away. With any amount of luck, we will be able to find something.” Carson started the meeting out strong.

The doors to the food opened as Carson finished talking. Plates of steak, mashed potatoes and green beans got put in front of us but it all smelled bad. | wasn't even hungry to eat so | just pushed my plate away.


“How many men are you taking?” Jace asked.

“A dozen or so. We will do a recon and with the men that Alec already has out, we should be okay. Be ready in case we do find something and need to get help.” Carson filled in between bites.

‘| have submitted a new patrol schedule to Jacob. This rotation includes the men we each brought and will place a mag every fier fore enti Sth between this pack and Alec's. The entire land is under war and we need to protect it all. There are enough men that if everyone does a twelve hour shift, they will only word three times a week.” Lars tosseda schedule sheet.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“| have a list of equipment needed for missions as well as a map of location of wolf friendly hospitals.” Aston gave us each a piece of paper.

After another bite, Carson spoke up again. “This is good.”

“| got a report from Jacob. They are building an undergrown panic room for all Lunas. It shoul finisHed in Ady grindshee it bectheir only project until it was finished.

Have your luna's ready to go in there and know where it is at.” Alec instructed everyone.

“The cameras and systems are fairly new and should be all the new m technology. You eq fave acess to apyott Wear as the distance, | don't think it is five but close to it.” That honestly wasn't a thought to about distance.

“| have one more thing | would like to bring to the table. I know this won't be a popular opinion but as we are going into war, | need to know. What is the possibility there is a mole?” Aston asked, seriously.


















###Chapter 0484

Alec and I just looked at each other. Not once did the possibility of a mole come into play. They really hasn't been attacks or anything that would suggest anything had been leaked. Though, we have put Gunther, Kara and Zac out there and each knew a little something so it wasn't like we were behind. The only thing that still confused me was how he knew about my informant.

"I wouldn't think so." Alec kept looking at me as he talked.

"The only thing that I still can't figure out is how they knew who my informant was. Honestly, I didn't even know who he was. Dad put his number in my phone before he died."

"That might be something to look into." Carson nodded.

"Have you thought about getting his informant?" Anthony asked.

"I have but it's not like I have had a chance to really figure out who that is." Setting my fork down, I pushed my half eaten plate away.

"Regardless, all information needs to stay in this room. Not even betas need to know what is going on. Their assignments need to be guarding the pack in our absence." Carson looked around, daring someone to argue.

Everyone bristled a little from being told what to do but no one said anything as it was the right call. "In the absence of Penny, Kristen will be preforming all duties for both packs. She has Emmy to help her but tell your lunas that all issues needs to go through her." Alec said. He didn't clear it with me but it wasn't like I was going to have an issue with the pack in her hands.

"Colt? Is that what you want?" Anthony asked.

My eyes met with his. Amusement clouded his expression, finding something humorous in this situation.


"Anthony, you have exactly two seconds to leave this room before my self-control is gone."

It wasn't me speaking, it was my wolf. He was an ancient wolf and although I had amazing control over him, he did not take disrespect lightly. Thankfully, Carson wrapped his hands around Anthony's neck and pulled him out of the room. Hank followed them out before shutting the door. "What is going on with him?" Jace asked as he leaned back.

Lars raised his arms above his head. "It's not like you would actual care your twin sister is taking over some luna duties."

"I think it was more about getting under his skin." Jace frowned at Lars.

Lars stood up. "Come on. Let's get a drink and go cool off."

I was the last one to stand up but they all waited for me and watched me until I stood up to follow them. It was obvious what they were doing. No one was leaving me alone. Who knew what I was capable of if I was left to my own devices. Blood would probably flow down the streets.noveldrama

"Here, drink this." Lars handed me the first drink from the bar before we headed out to the porch.

Not needed to be told twice, I grabbed it and downed it before they even had time to pour someone else a drink. Lars nodded, took my empty glass and refilled it before passing out more drinks. In the end, we walked out to the porch for some fresh air.

We had just sat down on the steps when the doors opened. Hank and Carson walked out without Anthony. "Lost some weight?" Aston asked.

"I'm not sure what the fuck is going on with him." Carson walked down and stood on the driveway.

Hank sat down just below me. Lars was on my left and Alec on the right. Jace was a little behind me but it was Carson that made me feel like I was okay. These were my people. We may not get together often and when we do it isn't for the right reasons but it always felt a sense of community with them.

I was hurting in the worst way. My boys gathered around me without making it obvious or too emotional. They would all be next to me in a moment's notice if we had a plan but we didn't. So, I am going to sit here and try not to think about what Penny was going through.

"What time do you want to leave tomorrow?" Hank asked Carson.

Carson took a long drink before answering. "Before daylight. That way there will be decent light when we get there. We don't even know where we are going to it will be interesting."

"Might need to make a visit to the old man to see what happened from that night." I said without looking at anyone. My eyes followed the swirls of the amber brown liquid.

"He hasn't called you since then, has he?" Alec asked.

"No."

"You know... we have a few extra bugs around that I could spare." Lars's voice sounded a little too excited.

"That should be easy enough to place." Jace sounded like he was smiling too.

"Colt can talk to him. Try to get him out of this house so we can place one there or at least place one around there.” Lars continued.

"Or in the actual auction site." Alec added on.

"What we need is a break. We need something to go our way that will allow us to really shove it to them. Kidnapping Penny was a massive blow. Basically making Colt barely functional would make it easier to attack. Not to mention her blood. We need to return the favor. They evened it out from when we stopped the convoy." Jace said but this time his voice was deadly.

"Hopefully we will find that tomorrow. If my daughter can make it to where they keep the girls, we will be able to really fuck them over." Carson matched Jace's energy.

"That is assuming she can do it." Lars gave Carson a look. "Is her wolf back?"

"She lost her wolf?" Jace asked, shocked.














###Chapter 0485 

Penny POV — Waking up the next morning was difficult. After the display on the T.V. I had to unplug it and crawled into bed.

Crying myself to sleep was all I could do. Now, a massive headache pounded every inch of my head. My eyes felt like they were going to pop out at any moment. That sandpaper feeling you get when you cry your eyes dry was the only feeling I could find. Even my babies were quiet this morning.

Usually, they were fighting but today, they were quiet. Part of me was worried there was something wrong but the other part felt like maybe they knew I was emotionally exhausted and they were giving me a break.

Sudden, sharp pains tightened at the base of my stomach. They were so sudden that my breath got caught in my throat. Lasting only a moment, it slowly faded away.

“Penny? Good morning!” The nurse called out as the door opened.

I couldn’t answer as another pain shot through me but this time, it didn’t go away. Fear pegged me as her footsteps got closer but I was almost paralyzed in pain.

“Penny? Are you awake?” Her voice was so calm and sweet sounding.

Thankfully, the blanket was pulled up to my face still. “Yeah.” I choked out.

“Give me a second and I'll be out.” I wasn’t sure she bought me telling her I was awake and okay but she didn’t

question me. Instead, I heard her footsteps leave before pots and pans clinked in the kitchenette. - How tears came to my eyes, I wasn’t sure but as I tried to move, it got worse.


Something told me not to tell her.

Swinging my legs over the side of the bed, Thad to inch my way off the bed and to the bathroom.

The door was still open. Giving her a small smile and a wave, I tried to hide the pain. One...two...three steps I took before I was out of eye sight and doubled over. It was like a tightening and then it felt like all my insides were going to fall out. If I did a squat, the babies would just slide right now this very moment, Making it slowly to the bathroom, the toilet was my first objective. Not

wanting to move my legs very far apart, I had to slide over, However, after sitting down and relieving myself, no babies slid out so I felt better about that. It didn’t change the sensation I got but at least I didn’t have to pee.

Using toilet paper and wiping, there was something greenish-yellow on the paper. It almost had a pinkish tent to it and looked like snot. My body froze as I looked down and realized it was my mucus plug.

These were either Braxton Hicks or I was in labor. All my reading flashed in my head. The pressure meant the babies had dropped. Losing my mucus plug meant my cervix was opening for the babies. Finally, the tightening was either early labor or Braxton Hicks.

What scared me the most was the thought of being so close to finally having these babies was that I had no idea where Colt was. Did he find out where I was yet? Or was I going to have to deliver by myself and pray that they didn’t take my babies? That is assuming they don’t need medical attention. Triplets are usually in the PICU for some time due to being delivered early but that was human babies. No one knew what my babies would be like.

“Penny? Is everything okay?” The nurse called out, closer than I expected.

“YEAH!” I called back instantly. “I’m just moving slow this morning.” It was the truth. Dropping the toilet paper, I flushed the evidence away and got up.

There was a closet full of clothes and | wanted out of this costume, A single dress caught my attention, telling me to slip it on. The smell of bacon and eggs filled my nose as I tied my hair up, out of my face.

“That smells good.” I tried to smile though the pain that reared it’s ugly head when I walked out. Defiantly irregular pain. @ “You need your strength today. The doctor is coming today. He wants to take some blood and do an ultrasound to see how close you are to delivering.” My heart skipped a few beats. It wasn’t like I had a choice. If I didn’t go along with it, I would lose my babies. They could even cut them out of me today.


The only peace of mind I had was

knowing they would still be alive.

“Okay.” It was all I could say in response.

“T’know it’s hard but just let him do what he needs to. Don’t push any more pain on your than you already have.

It’s bad enough your stress level is so high.” She looked at me like she actually cared about me.

I didn’t buy it. I knew she wanted out of there, or at least she told me so.

However, as she put eggs on my plate with a real smile on her face, I couldn’t help but wonder if she only faked asking that to keep up on what my plans were for escaping.

“Here you go!” The plate was filled high.

“Thank you.” I muttered as I picked up

my fork. Not wanting to meet her eyes.noveldrama

[kept my busy with memor izing everything in the kitchen. Why they needed to butcher blocks was beyond me.

“After he is done, we can play

a game or put a puzzle together?” The nurse offered. She looked almost hopeful.

“Maybe. I might need to lay down and rest after he takes my blood.” “That is true, you might be tired from the blood loss. OH!” It was like a light blub went off and she remembered something. Pulling out a bottle of orange juice from the fridge, she poured me a glass. “Drink up!” As soon as my hands wrapped around the glass, the bedroom door opened.














###Chapter 0486

Colt POV My office door opened without anyone knocking. “Did you even sleep?” Carson walked in with more energy than | cared for. Everyday that | was away from Penny, my mood reflected that.

“What do you think?” | asked. Truthfully, | don’t think | have slept since she was taken. How many days was that now? Enough that | was starting to question my decisions.

Carson pulled an orange pill bottle from his pocket and gently placed them on my desk. “You are no help to anyone if you don’t sleep. Your judgement is impaired. You will make mistakes. Those mistakes could cost you your life, the life of your men or worse... the life of Penny.” Carson sat down and waited... judging my reaction.

“Where did you get the pills?” | was half amused and half annoyed.

“The doctor. | asked him for something to help you. | knew you weren't going to listen to him. You might listen to Alec. However, | watched you grow. | was an uncle to you as you grew up. On a personal level, | think of you as my son. You're father was one of my best friends growing up. | made him a promise a week before he died and | promised him | would look after you. Be there for you. You have done one hell of a job so far. You need to sleep if you want to be able to get Penny back.” | wasn't fully surprised my dad reached out to him. He wasn’t wrong, he has been like my uncle. Gotbirthday gifts, attended any event | had and even showeda few fighting moves. If dad was going to ask anyone to help that | would listen to, he chose right.

“You think my judgement is being impaired?” | challenged.

“Not yet but it will if you don’t sleep.” He wasn’t blinking as he stared at me. He meant business and his focus wasn't going to shift off of me.


Grabbing the bottle, | slipped it in my pocket. “Is your daughter ready to go?” | was done with the heart to heart.

“She is. | wanted to speak with you alone first.” Carson sighed and relaxed in the arm chair. “She is with Hank at the front door. She is getting stronger but her wolf isn’t back so | don’t know how successful this will be.” “If you taught her the sthings you taught me, she might be able to get us closer.” “Assuming she kept her head on her shoulders. She is very traumatized over the entire thing.” Carson almost aged 40 years in five seconds “She doesn’t have a mate, right?” | was trying to remember but was drawing a blank. | didn’t even recognize her when | saw her because it had been so long.

“Not yet but until she gets her wolf back, she might not ever know.” “Why wouldn't she get her wolf back?” Surely, after healing a little, she would be able to get her wolf back.

“She said her wolf has been gone for a very long time.” Carson sighed as the fax started going off.

Looking at the clock, it was three in the morning. “What the fuck is this?” Reaching over to grab the paper, it tooka second to understand what | was reading. Beforewas multiple children that were kidnapped. sof these for over twenty-five years old. There was pictures of the kids when they were kidnapped and more pages cof what they might look like now.

“Will give these to the guys to study and look into while we are gone.” Sighing, | put them on my desk and stood up. “Ready?” “Ready as I'll ever be.” Carson slapped both hands on his knees before standing up. “If we still have Penny and this wasn’t about my daughter, | would actually be having fun. Sitting in an office gets boring after awhile.” “Can’t say I'm happy to help.” | didn’t even try to hide the sarcasm that laced my voice. Following Carson out of my office, we walked silently down to the foyer.

Carson's daughter, Nora, was like a whole different person than I pulled out of the van. Her hair is dark brown but the bags still hung under her eyes. She needed to gain like twenty pounds but overall, looked better. Color had returned to her cheeks and a spark filled her eyes as we cinto view.


“Alpha Colt. Thank you for saving me. I'm sorry | haven't had a chance to properly thank you before now.” She bowed low before offering her hand.

She was a few years older thanbut I have memories of the three of us playing in the ardwiign WaEwbte yeypagrvl @ol To it over and over sw 3 a again.” Accepting her hand, I tried to f ), put a smile on my face but | don't think it reached my eyes. Please read the original content at english.net.

“This is a long as drive. Why don’t you take a nap?” Carson said low to me.

“What if | don’t wake up when we get there?” “Take half of one. You will be fine.” Carson put the SUV in drive. Grabbing the unopened water bottle from the cup holder, he tossed it on my lap. noveldrama

###Chapter 0487

“Tto wake up.” Someone shook me. Only blackness filled my vision but soon all the sounds of people opening car doors and slamming them shut confused me.

“We are here?” | tried to open my eyes but it was hard. The sun was too bright and | just wanted to go back to the blackness.

“Yeah. We are close, anyway.” Carson opened the door and got out. Leavingalone in the car to gather myself. Everything crushing back, making my heart fall. Still, my body was stiff as fuck. It was sneeded sleep but | needed another twenty-four hours. That wasn’t happening until Penny chome.

| wasn’t sure how long | sat there, gathering myself to wake up but by the tI got out, they were all laughing.

“What's so funny?” | said in a very gruff voice.

“Nothing. We figured you could visit the old man first and then we can make our way.” Carson started.

“Hank will stay with Nora and | will see what | can do about planting a listening device.” “Do you have ear pieces for us to talk?” | asked, trying to keep from yawning.

“Right here.” Hank pulled out a black box from his pocket, with a click, he opened it and offered it to us. Carson and | both took one and put it in our ears as Hank did the same. Nora shook her head, declining one.

“Nora, you should listen in case you have something to add.” Carson said a little more softly to her.

“Okay.” She was a little unsure as she took one with shaking hands. Hank had to help her put it in her ear but eventually she got there.


“So, no plan. Just go in and see what we can find out?” | asked as | looked into the forest. At this point, | was so familiar with this forest that | could walk it in my sleep.

“Pretty much. Don’t worry, it will make things more interesting.” Carson slapped onon the shoulder.

“I've had enough excitement for awhile.” Without waiting to see if they were ready, | just headed off into the direction | have done numerous times already.

Walking around fallen trees or even areas | knew there was ssort of trap, my blank mind ledto the old man’s cabin. Not even smoke was coming up from the chimney but his silhouette bounced between the windows. noveldrama

“I'll hang back. Keep him busy in the house and I'll go down below.” Carson whispered in my ear.

“Beware of the cameras.” | said as | moved through the trees the sway | did last t| snuck up on him.

“Roger.” Carson had way too much excitement in his voice.

Shaking my head, | waited for the old man to walk out of his kitchen before | slipped in and sat down in the sseat as | did last time.

However, this time, he didn’t makewait before he climping back in. “You would like for the amount | paid you, you would be able to afford better living conditions.” | said, fully allowing my wolf to cto the surface. Up until now, | have kept him at bay but allowed him to show himself. Currently, | was letting him take charge.

The old man jumped in the air and turned at the stime. Clutching his head, he was breathing fast. “The actual fuck!” “I have to say, doing business with you hasn't been worth it.” Leaning forward, | let him see how black my eyes were when my wolf was present.


“Fuck...” He whispered. His eyes bounced around like he was looking for a weapon.

“Sit down. Let's talk.” Using my foot, | shoved his chair out for him. The sound of wood scraping against wood sent chills down my spine.

“Last t| talked to you, you fucking took the whole fucking convoy down!” He was picked. “Do you have any idea what that did to me?” “What did you expectto do? Wait till she was sold and then kidnap her? Makinggain another enemy in the process. How stupid are you?” My wolf had a bunch of anger he was trying to get out.

“I just assumed you would like stand in the street and take her. You killed Sir Joe Gambino’s men! Do you know who he is?” The old man didn't sit but stood there, glaring atlike he had any ground to argue on.

| have met him before. He knew my intentions and you knew them as well. Your job is to get TeRomtfor ney gave you too ch money for little information.

The way | see it, you can either givesomething else or | might just let it sleep how | knew about the convoy . + ” in the first place.” Please read the original content at english.net.

“Not like it matters when | don’t have any information to start with. | suggest you find something to interest me... and quickly.” “Got the auction site.” Carson said in my ear. It sounded like he was out of breath.

« p . .

Until this is over, the actions are closed. Alpha want to just buy private » — now.”

The old man turned away from me, a clear sign he is lying. “You would lay down your life on that?” | asked, sitting back. It was fun to watch the sweat drop off his hair.

“Not like | have anything else to do now!” He slammed his fist down on the table.

“I want to see the auction site again. | want to make sure you aren’t hiding anyone in there.” “Fine.” He tried to stomp out the door with a limp but almost fell. Now Carson would have full access to his house.















###Chapter 0488

“Not sure why you need to see this. You have already been down here.” THe old man grumbled as we made our way down the stairs. Since there wasn't any lights on, it was completely black until he switched them on.

Just like last time, it was like a concrete bunker. Really, | was just wasting time. With my hands in my pockets, | just walked around, pretending to take it all in. “Showin there.” | demanded.

“Show yourself!” He spit as he rolled his eyes and looked away.

“You can either showor | will forced you to show me.” My wolf's voice was deadly calm as | said each word.

Even if | wasn't this angry, there was something about watching someone squirm under my wolf's voice. With his face scrunched up, the old man started limping toward me, incredibly slow.

“There isn’t anything in there.” It was more of a snide remark under his breath but he knew I could still hear him.

“Excusefor not believing you.” There was a little humor in my voice as he turned the door knob. After flipping on the lights, | got my first look into the holding cells. Along each wall was multiple chain-linked cages with locks on the doors. At the end of the room was nothing but concrete. Drains were in every cell but it was the blood stains that really caught my attention. No door, no windows and no ventilation.

The stench was overwhelming as my eyes even started to water. “What is that smell?” “Rotting flesh probably. After you stopped the convoy, the alphas got into a massive fight. Few people died and their bodies only got removed earlier today.” The level of not giving a shit was very high. Death was as much a part of his life as breathing was.

“You don't have anything else schedule for events?” “None. There was going to be a cock fight but not anymore.” He didn’t ask if | was done or not. Flipping the light off, he started walking towards the door.

“What are you going to do now that you are out of business?” | asked once we were up the stairs.


“None of your fucking business.” “Is that what you think?” | asked. Instead of waiting for a reply, | turned and started walking back towards the woods.

“Lose my number! We are done!” He yelled after me.

Turning to look at him, | made sure my wolf was in full control. “We aren't done until | say we are done.” My voice was low enough that he would have barely heard it but there wasn't any pretending to not hear me.

Without waiting a response, it was my turn to walk away from him. It did lift my spirits a little to know that we have bugged his house and that might give us something. Not that | was holding my breath but | was being optimistic that he would give us something.

“Barely got out of there!” Carson joked as he ran past me.

“Losing your touch, old man?” | almost felt like smiling. Almost.

“No, just enjoying sunder cover action. That used to be my thing before | beca dad and alpha.” Carson reached the SUV before | did. He was already taking his ear piece off and getting into the drivers side.

“Ready?” | asked Nora and Hank as | got in the passenger side.

“Ready as I'll ever be.” She sighed.

“Here, Hank. You are in charge of the bugs.” Carson handed Hank a laptop before starting the car.

“Wonderful.” He sighed as he took it and sat back in his seat.


“Okay, we are going to travel down the road that you were on when Colt intercepted it. Do you remember how long you were on it?” Carson had pulled out and was driving down the road. We were about twenty miles away from where | took the convoy down but he needed to get her thinking.

“No. The road had so many sharp turns. We did go over sbumps like maybe railroad tracks.” “That's good.” Carson nodded.

Pulling up the map on my phone, | zoomed out to see the entire road. Looking for srailroad tracks to see if maybe we could find a direction. “Anything else? Sounds or smells?” | asked her.

“Oh... a few skunks. Nothing that | can think of.” Her voice trailed off. Looking behind me, she was nibbling on her lip. Worry plagued her face as she tried to remember what her brain was hiding.

“There are multiple plants around. A Hostess plant will give off a sickening sweet smell or a places Them will Sal of hal animals. Was there a smell that caught you off guard?” | tried to ask in a different way.

“I...” She trailed off and closed her eyes.

Not wanting to push, | kept my mouth shut as we arrived to tn the convoy was, He riphing te t Via te $d6tch marks on the road from the explosion. My wound was fully healed but the memory will haunt me. noveldrama

“This is where you saved me.” Nora asked, barely above a whisper. Carson had slowed down as he looked around.

“It is. Your vehicle flipped right there and everyone else wrecked therm Pong AeA: Seryane Waker me. “The spike strips didn't get your vehicle so we used a grenade launcher.”

“I survived a grenade launcher?” Nora looked shocked.

“I'm not sure how but you did. Everyone else had died or at least was going to before it exploded. How you didn’t have more injuries, I'm not sure.” “Can we keep going?” Nora asked. Goosebumps traveled up her arms as Carson pushed on the gas.

“Focus now. Think about how far you went. Work it backwards.” Carson tried to coach Nora into remembering.

“I don't see any railroad tracks around.” | whispered as | kept looking at the map.

“Where are Alec’s men?” Carson asked me.











###Chapter 0489

“They are watching the casino that Joe was at. | haven't actually heard from them.” Pulling out my phone, | sent them a text, asking if there was any updates. Carson wasn't driving the fastest but the anticipation was very thick. Nora’s head popped between Carson and | but she was looking out the windshield.

“Maybe there was an airport not far from here?” Carson did a double take and looked at her. “Why do you ask that?” “I heard the sound of a plane that was really close. Not sure if it was taking off or landing but it made the car vibrate.” Unlocking my phone, | pulled up the map and tried to find if there was an airport around here. “I don’t see anything on the maps..." “Actually, there are a tone of farmers in this area. There might be an old abandoned one that they have fixed up.” Hank snapped his fingers as he remembered something.

Putting my phone done, | just looked out the window. “If that was the case, then it could be anywhere.” “We drove on gravel for awhile.” Nora said, very uncertainty.

“Not sure that narrows it down.” | said out of frustration. | knew this was a long shot but damn if | couldn't help feel a little hopeful.

“It might.” Hank said from the back. “Turn here.” There was a a gravel road coming up on our left. “What's here?” Carson asked as he slammed on the break. My arm instinctually reached out and stopped myself from hitting the dashboard. Nora wasn’t so lucky as her body flew over the center consol. Carson tried to stop her but only managed to bloody her nose.

“Damn!” My wolf growled as Carson made the turn. noveldrama

“OW!” Nora grabbed her nose and got back in her seat.

“Here.” Looking back, Hank had given her a towel. Helping her hold it on her nose, he looked out the windshield.

“Is she okay?” Carson asked.

“Go up that hill.” Hank nodded ahead. | wasn’t sure where he was going with this but Carson listened as he kept going up the hill.


It was more like a tiny mountain but it was the only hill for miles. It wasn’t until we reached the top that | realized what he was wanting. If we got to the top, we could see for miles.

Carson drove till he was at the highest lookout place as possible. Pulling up to the edge of a cliff, he shut the SUV off. “Are you okay?” He asked as he turned around and looked a Nora.

Her eyes met his. “I've had worse.” Setting down the towel, she opened the doors and got out. Carson closed his eyes as he absorbed what she said. Wanting to give him space. Hank and | shared a look before we both got out.

“Got any binoculars?” | asked. The wind whipped at my hair as we stood at the edge.

“Yeah.” Hank said and walked back to the SUV.

We could see for miles.... if not hundreds of miles. The flat earth was not able to hide. “Do you see anything?” Nora’s voice surprisedas she walked up and stood next to me.

“Yes... no.” As | talked to her, | saw a line of smoke moving across the field.

“Here you go.” Hank shoved a pair of binoculars on my chest.

Putting them against my face, | had to adjust the setting so | could see more clear. “I'll be damn.” | whispered.

“What is it?” Carson asked.


“Atrain.” “Really?” Nora's voice raised a few octaves.

“Get a map and track this.” | told Hank.

Carson and Hank's voice becbackground noise as | kept looking. A few crop planes were flying low over the fields but nothing that would make someone think there is a plane.

“We might have to just drive down that road and see where it goes.” Carson's voice finally resonated with me, bringingback to the present.

“That road isn’t even on the map. Who owns this land?” Hank asked.

“According to the web. It is owned by.... Midnight LLC.” Carson's voice was barely a whisper.

My heart stopped as | looked over at him. “What did you say?” “Midnight LLC. Apparently, they own over thousands of acres of farm land and a few businesses.” “If Rip owned all this, it would be passed on to the next heir. Darin was his only son. Since Penny is now the alpha, this is all hers.” Hank said in awe.

“That would make her the owner of a certain casino.” Carson sounded almost gitty about it.

“I wonder if Joe is aware of that little bit of information.” This, might bed Us t under sRifAitte. This was plc Penny's land and they were on it.

“They might be fully invaded in this land. That's how the railroad hasn't been detected. Do YOp:e3 ra gy Eckard Sdjacent to this area? They have been using this as a neutral place.” Carson just looked at the vast land in front of us. P

“This is what we been missing.” Hank said. “They have been using this land as their hbase.” As excited as | was, | was also concerned. “This is huge. How are we going to stay undetected and investigate this area?” “Send a helicopter to survey the area from the air. Doing it from the ground isn't ideal.” Hank seemed to be in deep thought.

“They most likely have Penny around here. | am assuming they think this is hidden enough they won't get caught.” Nora said, speaking up for the first time.

She wasn't wrong. “Penny?” | knew it was a long shot but | tried anyway.

The mind-link was the qelyPypesien NRONAS at this point and as long as they haven't given her anything, | should be able to mind-link her. That would putwithin a few miles of her.
















###Chapter 0490 

Penny POV “Penny! Are you doing okay? You have been in there for awhile!” Rosalie kept knocking on the door. | was so conflicted with her that | wasn’t sure how to feel.

Currently, | was leaning on the vanity for support from the contractions. Assuming this was false labor, | refused to show it. It was nothing like what | read. From what | read, contractions were suppose to be on a constant schedule. Like every hour or something like that. What | am feeling was lasting for hours then go away for a little while before coming back full blast. There was a point after breakfast that | thought they were gone but | was wrong.

KNOCK! KNOCK! The door handle shook for the third time. “Penny! I'm getting worried!” | was getting very irritated at this point. Grabbing the handle, | ripped open and stared her down. “Il am nine months pregnant with fucking triplets. If it is going to takethirty minutes to use the bathroom then letfucking us thirty minutes!” It was a weird surge of power that ran through my veins. | happened so quickly that | instantly stopped being mad. The feeling of shock and guilt instantly replaced it. It was like my body shrunk back as | calmed down.

“I'm sorry!” Rosalie took a few steps back in shock. “You have just looked pale today and the doctor will be here in five minutes.” “I need to wash my hands and I'll be right out.” | said softer before shutting the door on her.

On one hand, that power was something | had never experienced before. It felt so good but yet so wrong at the stime.

Turning the water on to make it seem like | was washing my hands but in reality, | just wanted to know what the fuck just happened.

“Where is she?” | heard the doctor's voice from the livingroom.

“Washing her hands. She will be right out.” Rosalie sounded like she blew him off.

“Your attitude needs simproving.” His voice sent chills down my spine in fear.

Opening the door, | walked out to see the doctor's hand wrapped around Rosalie’s throat. Her feet weren't on the ground and her eyes were bulging out.

“Oh, good. You decided to join us.” The doctor looked over atand dropped Rosalie at the stime. Her body hit the floor with a thud.

All the concern | had about her being used to find dirt onwas gone. She looked up at him with disgust on her face. “No one has any patience around here.” Glaring at the doctor, | waddled my way over to the couch and sat down. The doctor glared atbut didn’t say anything as he started up. Laying out the needles and bag, he moved my arm to get started.

“Here, drink this.” Rosalie handledsomething that was green and looked like grass.

“What is it?” | asked as he stuck the needle in. | couldn't help but scrunch up my face as he did so.

A dull ache started squeezing my stomach. | knew what this ment at this point. Braxton Hicks. It had been like twenty minutes since the last one and it was the worst one yet.

“It will put svitamins and minerals back in your system. Keep those babies alive and healthy.” Rosalie looked atwith pity in her eyes and pushed the drink in my hands.

As much as | wanted to reject the drink, if it would help my babies, | would do it. The cold drink felt foreign in my hand but | drank it anyway. My stomach instantly started to turn in protest.

“No. This is not working out. I think | am going to be sick.” Shoving it back in her hands, | didn’t give them a second to find a bow! as | threw up all over the doctor. noveldrama

“Are you fucking serious?” He jumped to his feet and shouted at me.

“NO!” Rosalie stepped in front ofas the doctor's hand cdown and punched her in the eye.

| was so shocked | couldn't resist flinching from the pain in my stomach. “You're in labor?” The doctor was breathing heavily as he calmed down. Green vomit stained his white jacket. His eyes shifted to his wolf as he stared at me.

Never in my life have | ever been so scared as | was at this very moment. “You better leave! Sir Joe Gambino will not be happy to hear you were going to lay your hands on her!” Before he could even react, two guards busted down the door. One stood at each door as a slow moving as Sir Joe Gambino made his way into the room.

“ q q Q What is going on here? | just got a call from my men saying SOMES d isturbing things NiEoioe was not the dhe voice | heard from before.

This voice was deep and threatening.

“This bitch threw up all over me!” The doctor yelled as he pointed at his clothes.

“So you decided to punch the nurse?” Sir Joe was looking at the already blue eye of Rosalie.

“No, | jumped in front of Penny. He was going to hit her!” Rosalie looked daggers at the doctor.

“She would have had the nurse not jumped in front of her.” Sir Joe pulled out his left hand and snapped his finger.

Instantly, the guards walked over and grabbed the doctor by each arm. “NO! | didn’t break the rules!” He screamed and kicked as he was carried out of the room.

“Now, you are in labor?” My eyes left the retreating doctor to see the black eyes of Sir Joe Gambino.
















###| Chapter 0491 

Colt POV h “Come on. Let's get in the SUV and see where the road leads us.” Carson turned and walked back to the vehicle.

My heart sank when I didn’t get a response from Penny. I knew it was a ~ long shot but I needed something. Just the little bit of hope that she was okay.

I knew she was alive since our bond was still in place but I had no idea what kind of situation she was in.

A firm hand gripped my shoulder.

Turning, I saw Hank giving me a knowing look. “Come on. Let’s go find her.” Without saying a word, I just turned

around and got into the passenger's seat. Carson started up the SUV and pressed on the gas. As we made our way down the hill, Nora suddenly popped between us.

“After the tracks, take a left... no a right! Left!” Nora’s face scrunched up in confusion.

Carson looked over at her for a second.

“Did you turn and then go over the tracks?” “Yeah. I-I.... um...” Nora bit her lip like she didn’t want to say what she was thinking, “Whatever it is, we can handle it. Just say it.” Carson spoke up before I did.

“I tried to jump out of the car but failed. Only because they turned and I

hit the wall instead of the door. Then we hit the tracks and I hit my head against the floor with each bump, That's why I was handcuffed to the wall.” Carson clenched his jaw as he turned right. The train tracks were just ahead.

Slowing down, we crossed the train and came up on a gravel road that turned left.

“Hold it.” I said. Everything in me told me that going down this road wasn’t a good idea.

“What is it?” Hank asked.

“Carson, let’s go on foot. Hide the SUV and Nora stay here.” “Is that really needed?” Nora asked.

Turning around, I narrowed my eyes at

her. “Are you going to handle revisiting the place that you were tortured?” I knew my temper was raising but I was doing everything in my power to stay calm.

“He’s right. You stay here.” Carson backed up and pulled off the road and into the trees.

“I can be helpful!” Nora pleaded. She . tried grabbing my shirt my shirt asI got out.

“Stay here and stay out of sight. Don’t ruin this.” My wolf’s eyes flashed, making her retreat in fear. I could feel it. This was something huge and I needed to figure it out.

Slamming the door shut, my anger was rising. I wanted Vin dead. I wanted to punch all his guards in the face and I just wanted Penny back. Carson walked

in front of my face. Completely blocking my view.

“You need to focus.” i “I'm trying.” I growled back at him.

“Try harder!” Carson growled back.

“You don’t know what it’s like to have your pregnant mate kidnapped for your children! Don’t fucking tell me to calm down. I'm doing the fucking best I can!” As much as I wanted to punch him, I turned and

used the tree as my punching bag. Only when my knuckles were blood did Carson put his hand on my shoulder and squeeze.

“Ready?” “Let’s go.” My breathing was starting to slow down as we walked along the

trees. “Hold up.” Grabbing Carson’s hurt, I pulled him behind a tree.

“What is it?” Carson flattened himself against the trunk.

“Security camera. We will have to come back.” As soon as the words came out, alarm bells started sounding.

. Carson’s eyes got wide and we took off.

“Time to go.” Running at full sprint, bullets soon peppered around us. “Cover your face!” I yelled. With any amount of luck, we could get out of this undetected. The SUV was already running and ready for a quick get away.

Nora opened the back door and we jumped in. Hank floored it.

The back half the SUV drifted sideways


but as soon as we hit the tracks, it straighten out and he was able to get us back to the main highway. = “We will need to set up a full scale attack on that place.” Carson climbed into a seat.

Looking behind us, I kept an eye out but Hank never let up on the gas. My phone started ringing in my pocket.

Without even looking, I just answered it. “Alpha Colt.” “There hasn't been any movement at the casino. Nothing to be noted.” Alec’s men were reporting back.

“Get back to the pack. We found something and need to gather back.” Hanging up, the sun was barely in my eyes as we drove during sunset. Only

after we been driving for three hours did Nora close her eyes and get some sleep. SE My mind was thinking about taking the second pill when my phone rang again.

This time, I looked at the caller.

“What's up?” Alec didn’t waste any time with pleasantries. “How far away are you?” “A few hours. Why?” “There is a massive movement headed this way. The cameras are picking up something strange.” | “Send me a picture.” I said instantly.

Alec didn’t respond but my phone vibrated a few seconds later. Opening

the attachment, my heart dropped.

“Alec, those are the few wolves! Vin is attacking!” @» “I figured that out. Look at how many!” Alec growled.

Opening the picture again, I got a better look at it. What I initially thought was trees were actually thousands of wolves.” Holy shit.” I whispered.

“What's going on?” Carson asked. noveldrama

“Vin set up an attack. Thousands of his wolf army are miles from my pack.” “Luna’s are safe, men are in position.

Just get home!” Alec growled and hung up the phone.

“Drive faster!” I growled at Hank.

He didn’t need telling twice as he slammed on the gas. My body got tossed back against the seat. We were soon driving over a hundred miles per hour.

“How soon can we get there?” I growled. My wolf wanted to just run the whole way.













###Chapter 0492 

As fast as my wolf was, he was not able to run over 100 miles per hour. The need to get back to protect my pack was making my physically itch. My skin was crawling with anxiety.

Every time a warrior got hurt or kill would sent a sharp pain in my stomach. They were trained in multiple techniques of fighting but that did little against something they never fought against before. Something that was a mutant wolf. We still didn’t know anything about these animals. | wasn’t even sure what kind of defense system we had.

The fact that Alec had time to call me told me they were able to prepare some. He said all the lunas were in the panic room. Kristen was safe but the need for blood was getting so high. My claws were already extended but it wasn’t until Nora whimpered in fear that | realized | had already half shifted. My fangs were out, hair had sprouted on my arms and my torso had beefed up. Being an alpha made my wolf massive. Being mated to a true female alpha made me the biggest alpha.

Every now and then, | could see Carson and Hank flinch as we all were losing men. Carson was in more control and only had his claws extended but Hank was just as shifted as | was. Our wolves wanted blood but none more than mine.

We were only minutes from my pack and | could hear the growls and snarls of the battle still happening. My claw has been gripping the door handle for over ten miles. This was it. My wolf was finally going to be able to release some frustration. If Vin was here, he wasn’t going to be leaving.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

Carson drove the SUV through the closed gate, breaking it open as he skidded to a stop. My wolf didn’t even bother with opening the door, instead, he busted it open. He let out a massive

threatening growl, halting any fighting in the distance. With multiple eyes on me, my wolf shifted, taking over completely for the first time in years.

| didn’t even try to stop this ancient beast. He wanted blood and wasn’t going to stop until he got it. The fighting resumed as multiple mutant wolves headed towards him. It was like watching a movie the way my wolf weaved through the wolves. He was quick and went in for the kill. His jaws bit off the heads in one snap before moving on to the next. His claws dug at their chest until he could rip out their hearts.


Blood was dripping down from his coat but it wasn’t his. If he saw one of the warriors struggling, he immediately helped them. It didn’t matter who it was, he went to save them. noveldrama

| was never more proud of my wolf than at this moment. As he released his frustration, mine went down. The physical need to violence was slowly fading as he kept going. My wolf was an extension of me. He took so much of my pain to help me stay focus that he needed to release it. However, the anger was still there. Until Penny was back, that wasn’t going away.

Towards the end of the fight, our men had a line of mutant wolves wounded on the ground. | wasn’t having it.

There was so much blood on the grass that it oozed between his paws as he stalked towards his pray. The warriors tried talking to my wolf but after one look from him, they shut up and moved out of my way.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

Slowly, he creeped up on them. Stepping on his legs, the snap was music to our ears. Then his teeth sank into his throat. The feel of their growls slowly dying under us was a different type of climax that calmed him. Blood squirted across his face but he kept going. Only once every single on of them was dead, did he stop and look around.

All of the warriors from each pack was standing, staring at us. Some had their mouths open, some were nodding in approval and some had blank expression. With one more show of dominance, he lifted his head up and let out a massive growl and pushed his aura out as far and as powerful as he could make it. No one was left standing by the time he was done howling... not even the other alphas.

Pulling his aura back in, he gave one last huff before allowing me to take control again. He got down on one knee so when I got back into my human form, | was on one knee. Breathing heavily from the energy he exerted, | was both exhausted and somehow still felt so alive. The ability to focus and think rationally returned.

“A-alpha.” Standing up, a warrior walked up to me with his head bowed. He wasn’t part of my pack but he very timidly walked up to me and handed me a pair of shorts.


“Warriors! Get to work.” | growled. Instantly, everyone started gathering those who died of ours and tossing the mutants in the pile.

“Colt!” Alec’s voice sounded above everyone. The level of concern in it was clear but it was his eyes that told me something was wrong when he ran up to me.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

“Who is it?” | asked, concerned.

“It’s Kristen. She's in labor!” My heart dropped as his words sank in me. If Kristen was in labor, Penny would be too if she hasn't already.

“Go.” | said in a rough voice.

###Chapter 0493 

After my shower, | had put on my full tactical gear. The only thing | put on that wasn’t part of my uniform was the onyx necklace that | had gave Penny. It made it feel like she was still with me, close to me. It still contained her smell on a single strand of hair that had gotten stuck to it. | needed to stay focused for her so | could give this back.

Walking into my office, | was met with all the alphas. They were gathered around my desk looking at something.

“Good, you're here.” Carson glanced up at me before looking back down.

“What is this?” | asked. Jace and Lars opened up a space for me to come stand between them.

“I had my men look up and map out the territory that now belongs to Penny and in extension... you.” Carson traced the red outline for me to see the whole thing.

“The casino sits right here. This is where we were.” Hank said.

Follow current on noveldrama.org

Lars put his finger along a dotted blue line. “This is the railroad that isn’t listed on the government site.

Pubfuture Ads
Completely off grid.” Carson circled a few more spots. “These are what we believe are holding cells. An aerial view, compliments of G**<*e Maps that was updated last year, shows structures with bars on the window.” “That was also last year. We need to be prepared for different structures or really anything. We are going in blind. Colt and Alec have some understanding of the security systems that they use.” Hank continued.

“Motion detectors, cameras.... pretty much everything we had. | had to time everything perfectly with the help of five men looking from different views to even get close to the house.” “But you did.” Lars

was looking at me with more confidence in myself that | had. “We can do it again. We will have more men and better support.” “You will do it again because Penny's life depends on it...” Carson looked at me firmly.

“...and your babies.” Jace finished.

“I'm not arguing that. I'm asking where do we even start. Do we attack the Casino or take down each random building. That would give them time to take her and run.” “That's why you have us. We each will lead men in different areas. The black ops teams will start with the casino.

| have a blueprint of that...” Hank pulled out another map to lay down on top of the land.

“According to the men that had been there, if Penny was there, she will either be held in the basement or in one of the suits.” Anthony leaned down and started tracing it. “We would need to clear it floor by floor then.” Aston followed his lead. “We can assume cameras will be in every corner of the stairs. Maybe we can loop into the security or maybe just break into the security room.” As good as all this sounded, it just didn’t feel 100% right. “We need to think about the fact that they might not be there at all. There could be a house or another castle that isn’t on the map. She could be held anywhere in that area.” “You don’t think she is there?” Carson asked.

Every pair of eyes looked at me. “It just doesn’t feel right. | don’t know. | mean, we already know Joe works out of the casino. Logically, he will want to keep her close to know when the babies are born but something is telling me there is something we are missing.” Carson sighed. “Unfortunately, we don’t have the time to do more recon. We will separate into six or seven different groups. We have to act now. Our time is up. Prepare your men and get ready. We leave in a few hours.” Everyone walked out except for Carson. As soon as my office door was shut, he kept going. “Let’s separate the men into the areas they would be best for.” “Alec’s men have proven to be efficient with their security so far. We

have experience and | trust them. | want them to be backing me up when | penetrate the Casino.” “I agree. However, | am going to accompany you in there. My men are top notch with security. | will be in charge of getting into the security room and guiding your men to get Penny.” “Jace and Lars are good working together. They can penetrate these building there. Anthony should be with Aston and they need to recon this area over here. There is too much open land to nothing to be there.” “Hank’s men can tackle the train. Get both sides of there it leads.” “That's a big area for one person.” | was a little nervous for that.

“I hope you're right.” Nodding in respond, I tried to let his words give me hope. “I'm going to go check on Kristen and then I'll meet you out front.” “Wish her the best for me.” Carson held out his hand for me to shake.

Accepting it, | shook his hand before we left my office. | needed to make sure Kristen was okay and then it was time to get Penny back.















###Chapter 0494

There was so many conflicting feelings as | walked into the hospital. The love | held for my sister was so deep that | used to think nothing would come before her. Now, | needed to fake my happiness because seeing her with my niece was going to eat me alive until | held my own babies.

“Colt?” My head was down as | walked mindlessly to her room. | was surprised to hear Jasper call out my name. “What are you doing here?” | asked, trying to rain in my emotions.

“Came to see the baby before we took off. | am assuming you are doing the same?” Jasper turned and started walking to the side.

“lam.” Jasper knocked three times and waited. The door cracked open just enough for Jasper to look in and talk to whoever stood on the other side. “Colt’s here.” “Let him in.” | heard Kristen voice sounded weak but happy. The door opened, and Alec stepped aside.

Kristen was breastfeeding the little baby as | walked in. The entire sight was like a knife to my heart but | put a smile on. “How are you feeling?” | asked her and cleared my throat. Coming up to her, I looked down at the little girl. She looked so peaceful.

“I am feeling pretty good actually. The delivery was very quick. Here, meet your niece.” Kristen pulled the baby off her breast. After a quick wipe of her face, she handed me the biggest blue eye girl I'd ever seen.

“She is so perfect.” The smile that formed my mouth wide was pure and real. Real happiness drifted down my body as she connected eyes with me.


“Technically, she is your daughter. We share the same DNA.” Kristen laughed as she finished cleaning herself up.

“What did you name her?” Wanting to give my sister some privacy, | walked over to the chair and sat down. It felt so good to have her cooing in my arms.

“I still haven't gotten your blessing on our name.” Kristen said hesitantly. “We don’t have to decide now.” “Adalynn is a beautiful name for my niece. We are going to name our daughter Eliana.” “Eliana? That is beautiful. Who picked that?” Looking up, Kristen was resting her head back, smiling at me. Alec was standing on the foot of her bed, just watching Kristen with his arms folded.

“No idea. When | was unconcious, | had a vision of my children. They all had names on them.” “Penny did say you were acting weird about the baby blankets.” Kristen was half laughing at she looked at Alec.

“Come here.” Alec moved to her side and sat down on her bed. “What do you need?” “I need you to go with Colt and get Penny back. Colt is not okay and you remember what it was like when | was gone and | wasn’t pregnant. Get my sister-in-law back and come back to us.” “Ice, we got it covered. Alec is where he needs to be.” Standing up, | walked over and handed her back her daughter.

“I don’t disagree with you but you stood beside him to get me and now he will stand beside you. I'm okay. Jasper will stay with me. Truly, | am okay.” Ice put her hand on Alec's chest and looked into his eyes.

| couldn’t look away as Kristen ran her finger so gently over Adalynn’s face. “We are strong but we are only as strong as our family. Colt is not okay and needs us. Go.” “Are you sure?” Alec asked. | could tell he was conflicted.

“It's really okay, Ice.” My hand rested on top of her head. We made eye contact and | could tell by her eyes that she meant what she was saying. She could always see into my soul. Call it twintelopy but she always knew. | could how sincere she was being and there wasn’t any bad feelings there.

“I'm completely serious. Alec was here for me for the birth. Now he needs to be there for you. Emmy will be here with me to help me. Just make sure he comes back to me.” “I'll give you two a minute.” Leaning down, | kissed Kristen on the forehead. “I love you, Kristen.” | whispered before | stood up.

| was almost to the door when | heard Kristen reply. “I love you too, Colt. Bring Penny back to us and those babies.”

My body froze in shock that she af g ) actually said it out loud. It Wasp tie first time bu twas dently always Al en she did. Giving her a smile, | walked out and shut the door.

wp . » I'm going to head back.” | told Jasper. Without waiting for an om answer, | just KeRb@HkinG: AGpyBH Gave me even more reason to stay focused. | had three babies and | was going to be getting them back.

By the time | made my way to the front of the packhouse, Carson was talking to everyone, telling them what their assignments were. “How's it going?” | asked, walking up beside Anthony. noveldrama

“Everyone knows their job. They are organizing within their groups. Some men are better suited in different groups so we all need ear pieces.” Carson started pulled out the entire land.

“I'm not surprised.” The wind was blowing the corners up so Carson laid it on the ground and put rocks on the corners.

“The tech guys will need time to penetrate the casino and make it to the security room. We will have to have our timing perfectly.” “Do we know what the each floor plan looks like for the casino?” | asked, thinking more clearly.

I » .

Yeah.” Carson grabbed the briefcase behind him and pulled out jee) q p $ pieces clog toiiRe there are fou fig rs of regular rooms and then three floors of suites. Two suites per ” og floor.”

“One on each side.” | nodded. “That means we will need to have two teams per group.”














###Chapter 0495

Penny POV SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! The contractions were still over ten minutes apart but they hurt like a bitch. “I can have the doctor give you an epidural.” Rosalie asked again as she rugged my back.

Currently, | was walking but | had to stop as the contractions started. Grabbing the wall, | was bent over in pain until they passed. After Joe left, more machines and different tools came into the room that | asked them to cover up.

“No epidural.” | groaned. There was no way in hell | was going to let them immobilize me. What if | had to make a run for it? What if they tried to take my babies from me? No, | needed to have my legs.

“Here, drink more water. You need to stay hydrated. If you feel dizzy at all, we need to sit. He took some blood so | would be surprised if you don’t feel dizzy.” Rosalie sighed in response. Her voice was a little horse from getting choked and her lip was looking better but still bruised.

“How long do you think | will be in labor?” | asked as | started walking again. | wasn’t permitted to leave this room so | was walking around the couch. Rosalie insisted | put an adult diaper on so the itchy material made all this extremely uncomfortable. Not that this situation was comfortable but this was just the icing on the top.

“This is your first delivery and with triplets. Your contractions aren't making much progress so it could be tomorrow or the next day. Some women labor for days if you do it naturally.” | didn’t say anything to her but | could deal with the pain if it meant giving me more time for Colt to find me.

Keeping these babies in as long as possible was my goal. | would deal with any amount of pain.

At this point, a thin layer of sweat had formed on my forehead. My wolf has been more present today than she ever has in my entire life. She was feeding me energy that | needed to deal with the pain. It felt like she was expecting trouble, which, gave me some hope that Colt was coming.

The door busted open just as another contraction was hitting. “This is your new doctor.” Sir Joe walked in with a very professional looking male doctor. He was looking at a clip board and didn’t bother to look up.

His hair was almost completely gone but it was Rosalie that stiffened up next to me that sent warning bells in my head. Even my wolf was in a defensive position. “My name is Dr. Darington. We need to get you in bed so | can check your process and start you on some Pitocin.” “I don’t want any medical intervention. | am going to labor the natural way.” | said through gritted teeth. It took everything in me to even speak to them.


“Actually, you're not. Due to the terms of your agreement with Sir Joe, you agreed to recieve medical treatment.

It is my professional opinion that laboring with triplets is too risky to do it naturally. We need to monitor their heart beats and make sure they are in position to deliver naturally and not a C-section.” “Since that is his medical advice, that is what we are going to do, or do | need to remind you that you agreed to listen or I will be taking your babies as soon as they are born.” Sir Joe frowned and folded his hands together in front of him.

“That's...” | was so stunned | couldn’t speak. It was like he trapped me.

“On the bed, please.” The doctor moved over to the bed and turned on the ultrasound machine.

“Just walk.” Rosalie whispered and she gently pushed me towards the bed.

“This isn’t what | wanted.” Tears threatened to fall but | refused to let them. It wasn’t the birth plan | wanted but if | needed to do it this way to keep my babies, | would. noveldrama

“Come on now, it's only in the babies best interest.” Sir Joe gave me a smile as | climbed on the bed.

“No, it's in your best interest. Nothing about this is in my best interest.” My wolf pushed through and growled at him with each word. Everyone was surprised by this but Sir Joe found it amusing.

“Kept that spirit up, you will need it.” He smirked before walking out of the room.

“Alright, let's see how dilated you are.” Dr. Darington said.


“Actually, Sir Joe agreed to not have a male doctor check her. | will do that examination.” Rosalie looked daggers at her.

“Do | need to get Sir Joe back in here to check that?” He lifted an eyebrow at her.

“Sure, we got time.” Rosalie crossed her arms over her chest and popped out a hip.

Dr. Darington rolled his eyes but there was a flash of anger from his wolf that he didn’t like being challenged.

“Fine, you can do the check. | am going to do a quick ultrasound.”

That was at least something. It was already uncomfortable enough to check, | didn't want someone employed by Sir Joe to do it. It's not like it was sexual but still felt really personal.

The gel was cold on my belly as he squirted it. “She is dilated 3mm.” Rosalie said with a tone that made Dr.

Darington narrow his eyes at her.

Pictures of my babies started showing up on the screen. Looks to be in position. All three of them are poited downward which is almost unheard of. You might get to deliver ” naturally after all.” He almost seemed disappointed.

“Great.” | was at least thankful for that.

“I'll get the Pitocin started and that should speed things up.”

There isn't any medical reason to speed things up. That isn't Standard of care .The babies are in position and she is progressing naturally.

Rosalie stood her ground against the doctor.

“Be careful, nurse. You are replaceable.”




















###Chapter 0496 

Colt POV “We can do that. One suite per side of the building.” Carson was counting the men that will be in our group.

“Where am | going to be?” Alec's voice came up behind me.

Standing up, | looked at him with a blank expression. “You don’t have to do this.” “You are my brother. I'm going. Don't argue and tell me where you need me.” He held his hand out for me.

Looking at it for a second, my hand wrapped around his and he pulled me into a half hug. “Forever.” “Thanks, man.” “You will be helping with the train takedown.” Carson trailed off as he looked for Hank.

“I think we actually have it handled.” Hank walked up behind Carson as we started talking. “I have my gamma with me and he is beyond capable. Alec would be more useful at the Casino getting Penny back. He knows his men and I'm not expecting too any issues with the train anyway.” “Are you sure? | am willing to do whatever you guys need me to.” Alec looked concern at this.

“Positive. We are going to derail the train so it will be pretty easy to tackle that. The most important thing is we have the gun power. If you have any high range or machine guns, | would take those. That will be helpful in taking down any of those mutants.” “We have that. Alec, show him the armory and let him pick out what he needs.” | nodded at his plan. It sounded like it would be easy enough. However, nothing about this was going to be easy.

“You know, we have all these plans but we haven't discussed what we are going to do about him actually making these mutants. We need to find his lab and level it.” Why this just dawned on me was a shock. How did no one else think of this? “I'm hoping it will be discovered when we raid all these buildings.” Carson sighed. “This is our own lead and truthfully, we don’t have any proof what we are looking for is even here. We could do all this and find nothing.” He wasn’t wrong but something was telling me we were doing the right thing. It had to be. The alternative is unthinkable. If this was wrong, we literally had nothing.

“Colt, come explain how this is going to work to the men.” Alec slapped my shoulder and motioned for us to come over to his men. They were currently looking at a copy of the casino blueprints.

“Let me grab my men too so we can be clear on it all.” Carson said before jogging off to another group of guys.

Alec got their attentions and had them make room. Getting on my knees, | made sure everyone could see me.


Once Carson showed up with his men, | got started.

With my finger, | pointed out the five men that | have more trust to cover my ass that wasn’t family. “You guys will have to find a way to get into the security room without raising suspicion or getting caught. Our entire operation depends on this.” “Do we know where it is located?” Blake asked.

“According to the blueprints, on the basement level. However, we went down the stairs when we have our meeting with Sir Joe so his office is down there as well. Not sure where exactly to be honest but it will be tricky.” Carson knelt down and traced a path with his finger. “This is what | am thinking would be the best way but when you get in there, you will have to use your best educated guess.” “Comforting.” Someone muttered but | didn’t blame him.

“After you guys get in there, you will have to guide us to find Penny. The rest of us are going in two groups and will clear one flgeekta 1540) You Wy beumeyed tnd our ears as we move through the building. Limit human life loss and | don't want our presence known until we have Penny in our possession. Even then, | would like to have her extracted by that time.” Carson was being firm with his directions.

Standing up, | made sure my voice was loud enough to get everyone's attentions. “Our timing needs to be perfect. We need to penetrate then casino first. Find Benayind-y to get J) bédbre shyone else

attacks. Only when we have her secured, can you move. If anyone moves too early, they could take her and run. There is an airport around there that we are unsure of. If they get her on a plane, we have lost her and my children forever. If that happens, | can guarantee no one will be making it home to their family.”

“What Alpha Colt is trying to say is mistakes will not be tolerated during this mission. This is easily the more important mission you have ever been apart of. The future of the werewolf race is being challenged right now. You all have fought these mutants. Their lack of CEES ae) human life will Gays @tissive de3tratibh Every movement needs to be precise and thought out. Every shot you take needs to be on the target. No mistakes. Not only will we save Luna Penny and their children but we will be ending Vin. Ending the production of the mutant wolves. noveldrama

Ending the usage of innocent humans for experiments. Ending the auctioning of innocent women. You all have been selected because of your skills, your bravery and how reliable you are. Each alpha has confidence in your ability to achieve our goal and trust in every single one of you. Let's prove to everyone watching that we will not lay down and take this disrespect. Not even the mafia will keep us from doing what is right. Let's bow our heads and pray to the Moon Goddess for an easy victory!”

By the end of Carson's speech, everyone was fired up and ready to go to war. Bowing my head, three little faces flashed before my eyes.











###Chapter 0497 

We have been on the road for a few hours now. Alec was driving our SUV but there wasn’t very many men in this one. This one had all the medical supplies that Penny might need. There was items for the babies but I was praying hard that we wouldn’t need them. There was only one person that was going to be directly behind me that wasn’t from Alec, mine or Carson’s pack. He was actually from Lars’s pack and he was a trained doctor. His fighting still were still top notch but if Penny or anyone needed medical, he would be here for it.

with the risk of Penny or the babies needing medical attention, I was not someone that should be driving. So, 1 got to sit in the passenger seal and

shift constantly with anxiety. More than once, Alec swatted my hand as it was tapping on the center consol. My wolf was ready.

Since this was so high profile and we had no way of knowing what kind of security they will have, we were going to be parking a ways away and walk in.

However, there was an hour difference between when we were schedule to arrive and when the last of the team was in position.

Jace was going to be control of the command center. If we needed immediate extraction, he was the man for the job. If Grand Theft Auto was real, he would be the main character.

So, as we pulled up to our base, it was good to see him telling people what do it and where to go.

On top of the hill was a little breezy but it had a great visual to the railroad tracks and even a few of the building in the distance. A few group of men took off running in different directions as I walked up to Jace.

“We are on schedule. Here is your ear piece and a few other fun items.” Jace pushed a bottle of chloroform, a rag and few grenades.

“Thanks.” Jace did a double take. I was no longer in control. My wolf forced his way in and there was no stopping him. He needed this and as much as I wanted to be the one to do it, he was the man for the job. Nothing will keep him from getting his mate.

“Ready?” Alec asked from behind me.

“Let's go.” Alec did a double take as well but didn’t seem surprised. He actually seemed pleased as he followed behind me as I passed him.

“Let’s head out!” Alec commanded. I didn’t bother to turn around and look behind me. I knew they would be falling into line.

As we got into the trees, an eerie quiet fell around me. The sun was fading behind the trees but the usual nighttime animals were not making their usual sounds. Every sense my wolf had was in tune to what was going on around us. There wasn’t an danger in front of us, we were the danger.

The animals sensed us and realized the danger we brought with us. The realization made me smirk. With each step, my mouth watered, my

adrenaline fueled my heart. They were going to die tonight.

Our footsteps barely made any sounds so when I heard a finger snap behind me, my body instantly froze. It was like watching a movie through my own eyes as my wolf turned my head to look at who it was.

Alec was looking through some binoculars. Looking into the trees, he took a few steps and then moved behind a tree. Lowering the binoculars, he signaled. Cameras. We were now close enough to security

cameras to be seen. Since there was so many of us and it would be next to impossible to move around them, one by one, we were going to climb.

The thing about cameras was, they only put them so high up. No one

thought to add more on the tops of the trees because you would get nothing but alerts on birds. The forest was thick enough that we would be able to jump from tree to tree.

Being a wolf had its advantages. Bring my claws out, my wolf climbed the tree and easily made it to the thickest branch. Walking to the end, he was able to step across to another branch.

One by one, they followed my back.

Avoiding multiple camera and any other traps that were set out. The pleasure of knowing we were out thinking them only fueled me more.

The closer and closer we got, the louder the voices and music became.

Drunk people yelling and cussing

echoed across the forest. Even the quiet birds flew off from their noise. noveldrama

Each time the door opened, the sounds of slot machines and money guided my path.

“Hurry up, Ken! We don’t fucking have all night!” A vendor was yelling at his help. The name, Instant Clean, was dripping down his van. multiple people in uniforms were walking in and our with massive hoses.

«1 think we found our way in.” One of the men whispered.

The van’s back door was opened and I could see a hose running from within it to an opened service door on the back of the casino. Multiple people were coming in and out. Some dumping trash, others with the cleaning service and some just on their breaks, smoking ]

a cigarette.

“Go around to the other side. This side is too open.” Alec whispered. N They didn’t answer but they didn ‘t need to. Silently, they fell into the darkness as they made their way around. With staying on top of the trees, it was going to take a few minutes for them to get ready.

“Hank in position. Train is currently stationed and not moving.” Hank checked in.

«still thirty minutes out for Anthony.” “Stand by for breech for Alec.” Alec whispered.

“Fuck you! I don’t need this!” I watched as a member of the cleaning staff threw something into the van. He

pulled out a cigarette and lit it as he walked into the forest.


















###Chapter 0498

My heart wanted to jump out of my chest but my wolf kept it calm. Each slow beat was like another piece of rope, holdingback from just running in there to get Penny.

"Penny?" I tried again in the mind-link.

"Colt?" Penny's voice sounded surprised and like she was getting ready to cry.

"Don't let them know you are talking to me. Stay strong. What is going on? Where are you?" "I don't know!" Penny sounded like she was holding back tears. Both relief and pure panic fought for a dominate position in her emotional system. "I am in labor! I-I have a nurse witha-and the doctor just left." "Penny is in labor." My wolf whispered to Alec and Carson.

Both of them looked atinstantly. "What?" Alec clarified.

"Colt is speaking with her in the mind-link. She is here and in labor." Alec and Carson looked at eachother. Their expressions hardened but otherwise they didn't give anything away. "The complicates things." Carson grabbed his earpiece. "Status report?" "Changing now." We heard back.

"Penny, do you know where you are at?" I pushed again for any information. "I need you to focus. I'm here to get you but I need your help." “I don't. I'm in a room with a livingroom and bedrooms. There is a kitchen too." It sounded like she was trying to pull herself together.

"She's in a suite." My wolf told them. noveldrama

"Penny, I love you. Take a deep breath and focus. We are coming for you. Don't raise suspicion be ready. I need for you to stay strong for me. Can you do that?" "Yes. For you and for our babies." It sounded like a little whimper escaped but she quickly pushed it down and the determination fueled her.

"I need to focus but I'll keep this link open in case.” I said as I watched the warrior walk out of the forest. "Okay. Please hurry, I'll be ready." "Get ready." Carson moved so he was in a better position to

jump off the tree. "Don't raise suspicion." He warned his men. All of them were now walking towards the door. The other not in uniform quickly jetted behind the trash bins.

The one in his uniform, I watched lite a cigarette and just stand there with his back turned. "Still fucking smoking?" A guy cout yelling and tossing his hands in the air.

Our guy pulled out a white cloth and when the guy tried to turn him, he quickly put the cloth over his mouth and drug him behind the trash. A second later, he cback out and stood with his back turned and kept smoking like nothing happened.

Again, someone cout to yell at him and he quickly put the cloth over their mouth and drug him. About five minutes later, they all cout wearing a little too small cleaning uniforms. With their hats pulled down low, they grabbed ssupplies and walked into the casino.

"Everyone hold. Group one penetrated and in route to security room." Carson whispered.

A few minutes later, we got a response. "In position for Anthony." That was it, everyone was in position. Now it was a waiting game. Everyone was dead quiet as we listened to their coordinate with each other.

"Someone's coming! In here!" First guy whispered loudly and then there was sshuffling before we heard a quiet click. There was voices in the distance but I couldn't make out what they were saying.

"Stairs are around the corner. Rags ready?" Another guys said. My wolf could care less who said said but he was inching for them to hurry up.

"Let's go!" Another person whispered.

We were met with more shuffling. There was a little groan at one point. "Shit!" Someone yelled and there was a little scream before it was quickly silenced.

"Burt? Was that you?" I heard someone yell in the distance.

"Just slipped!" On of our guys tried to yell back like he was Burt.

"Slipped?" Shit, he didn't go for it! At this point, all I could do was focus all my attention on listening to this. Since I was inside my own head, it sounded like surround sound. My wolf was hearing it from his right ear but to me, it sounded like it cfrom everywhere.

"Fucking damnit!" Someone groaned and then there was a struggle before we heard a door open and close.

"He is one of Joe's guards!" "Well, he's dead now. We need to keep moving!" Something heavy fell to the floor with a thud.

"That won't go unnoticed for very long."

"Probably not." There was a small click and more shuffling as I assumed they kept I kept maying. Morm doors opened and closed. Picturing them in my mind, they were on the hallway we assumed was where the security room was at.

"It's not here." Someone reported back to Carson.

"Fuck." Carson closed his eyes, trying to remember the layout.

"Go back up one floor." Alec spoke up for the first time, telling his men where to go. "There was a utility room on the layout. Maybe that is the security room." "That's also the floor that Joe has his office.” Carson whispered.

Alec frowned. "I know but it isn't on the bottom level. The other alternative is if the security room is on the main level." "Let's hope not." Carson nodded in agreement. "Stay to the shadows, you can't be

seen." He said to the men.

"Going dark." Alec's men used this to tell us they will not be able to talk for stime. It meant there were people around and any noise could be heard, giving away their position.

As we waited, a limo pulled up to the back entrance. A swarm of warriors cout ina fcasino and stood They created an aisle for whoever was in the limo to walk through.

Someone more professionally looking walked out and opened their car door. "Sir Joe! Sir Vin! I'm glad you made it here safely!" He said as Joe and Vin stepped out.










###Chapter 0499

"Thank you. This should be an exciting night for sure." Sir Joe said with a laugh as they all walked in. The limo drove off and all the warriors piled in after Joe and Vin.

My wolf had to physically bite my lip to keep from growling. Both Alec and Carson grabbed and arm. Squeezing it to keep him from just busting out of the woods and attacking. Not only was Penny's life in danger but our children and all the humans that were enjoying sgambling.

"Good. Now, I won't have to go look for them." My wolf growled so low that Alec and Carson glanced at each other quickly and then repositioned themselves. Both of them let go of my body and turned around.

Looking at my watch, it was another ten minutes since we heard from Alec's men. “Penny, are you okay?” I asked again. I was really filling the silence as we waited.

"Contractions hurt like a fucking bitch." It sounded like Penny was having one at this moment.

"I'm so sorry I'm not there." "It's okay. Now that Joe hasn't cback, it is okay." "What do you mean, cback? I just watched him arrive." Her words surprised my wolf even. He straighten up his back.

"It's a long story but I had to get a different doctor and Joe broughtanother doctor earlier today." Penny seemed unfazed by this. "Vin won't bother me." "Why do you say that?" "It was part of an agreement I had with Joe. I had no choice, I did what was best for our babies. My hope is you would savebefore it becan issue." I didn't get a chance to respond as Alec's men started talking. "Security room secured." "Joe and Vin just made it to his office." Another warrior said. I could hear sclicking of the mouse and someone clicking their tongue in their mouth.

"We might need ssort of distraction." Carson's body started twitching with either excitement or anxiety, I wasn't sure. "Got you covered." The excitement in his voice was a little concerning. "Be ready." I wasn't

sure what we were waiting for but I heard the door open and close. "Take a right, Fred." "What are you guys doing?" Alec asked.

"Creating a distraction that won't lead people into thinking something is wrong and need to check on the security room." They said in reply.

"By doing what?" Alec sounded more concerned at this point.

"That's it, no one is watching." Carson, Alec and I all looked at each other when Alec's guys started laughing. "Hurry up!" "Shit! That was close!" Fred laughed as he slipped back into the security room.

"Now! Get in here!" Someone yelled.

"What did you do?" Alec demanded as we jumped down. Staying low, we ran to the casino.

"Turn left. There is a door to the stairs. It is empty right now." One guy said.

"Fred knocked out a random due and made him spill his drink on soutlet. This caused half of the slots to shut down." "You knocked a guy out?" Carson asked, a little angry.

"No. Used chloroform and made it look like he passed out. Damn, givescredit.” “My family's life is riding on this. It's not the tto fuck around or I'll help you find out.” My wolf growled as we made our way up the stairs.

"The first door is part of the suites. There are three floors. We know Luna Penny is in one of them. Remember, two teams. I can see Penny on the camera but it doesn't tellwhat floor she is on. Currently, she is on her bed, hooked up to an I.V. There is a lady beside her and I don't see anyone else in there. Two suites per floor." "There are two guards standing outside her door. There is also a guard on either side of the hallway. Have your silencers out on your guns." As soon as the men announced it, both Alec

and Carson pulled out their silencers and screwed them on. Holding a gun wasn't going to work right now as my hands resembled more paws than hands.

"Whenever you are ready." Alec's men gave us the go.

Carson looked around to make sure everyone was indeed ready. "I'll go low, you go high. I'll get the left, you go right."

Alec nodded in understanding.

Carson pushed the bar, opening the door quickly. Immediately, he got to one knee as Alec stepped almost over him but still behind him. The warriors barely had tto react before Alec and Carson fire multiple rounds. It was head shots for the one directly next to us and the ones guarding the hallway. Carson fired multiple rounds at the guy across the hallway but he hadn't fully died.

Walking behind Alec, we watched Carson jump up and run over to him.

He had just squeezed his walkiem talkie when Carson put the gun When flushed to his forehead and pressed m the trigger. His body jerked before laying completely still. Alec had his hand on one of suite doors and Carson ran over to do the same.

"Three... two... one!" Carson counted down. Each person on the teams ran inside as I stood in the hallway. Looking through both doors, waiting to see which room I needed to go to. noveldrama

"Don't move!" "Hands up!" "Negative here! No Penny." "No Penny here!" "Tie them up and knock them out!" Carson yelled.

This wasn't the floor and if I was honest with myself, I knew she would be on the third floor. The most, e mostom difficult room to get to Pacing in the hallway was the most annoying thing as we waiting for the

men to finish in the rooms. We couldn't afford for anyone to get out and warn Joe or Vin so it was chloroform and zip ties for everyone.

"How are we looking?" Alec asked his men.








###Chapter 0500 

“So far we are golden.” There was some keyboard action but otherwise it was quiet. noveldrama

“There isn’t any video in Joe’s office, is there?” Carson asked.

“No. This is a massive room and it is taking all of us to look at the cameras.” I figured so. A casino wasn’t small and the amount of cameras needed to look at every angle would be in the hundreds. Alec and his men came out before Carson and his group did.

“Ready?” I asked him.

“Let’s go.” We walked to the stairwell and Alec had

put his hand on the door to open it when our ears started ringing.

“Hold up. There are some guest in the stairs.” “Where did they come from?” Carson asked.

“No idea. I didn’t see until I double checked the stairs. They have the guy in the casino medical center and the slots are open again. There is a camera over there we believe Joe’s office is located. That should show us anyone coming and going. I can’t look up history without exiting the cameras we are watching to get you to Penny.” We could hear a door open and close in the distance. “Okay, coast is clear.” Alec pushed the door open and we all silently made our way up the stairs to

the next level. “There is the same number and position of guards as the previous floor.” They said in our ears: Something in me told me this still wasn’t the floor we needed to be one but my wolf followed the directions.

We had to be sure and we needed to clear everything. What if these rooms had nothing but guards in them? What if Vin was actually in one?” “Go! Go! Go!” Carson whispered yelled as he opened the door. This time, I couldn’t see them shoot but I heard the click of the trigger going off. The clear thud of bodies hitting the floor was evident but my wolf didn’t feel the need to run in like he did before.

Alec and Carson penetrated the suites at the same time with precision and


accuracy. “Whoa... we got a new player.” The men in the security room sounded both amused and intrigued.

“Who is it?” Alec growled.

“That old man that ran the auctions.

He got dropped off by some of Joe’s men. They aren’t exactly carrying him by his neck but he isn’t given an option either.” “Follow where they are headed. We can’t do anything for him. Our focus is Penny. No change in plans and everyone hold their positions!” My wolf growled. He wasn’t going to lose Penny over him. If that was a sacrifice then he was willing to make that one. | “He is walking into the hallway we thought was Joe's office and is now off

camera.” At this point, we were all standing in the hallway, waiting to hear what was going on. Sm As soon as we got confirmation about the location of the office, I felt better about it. “Good. Keep an eye out.

Finished on the second floor.” The overwhelming urge to tell Penny I was going up to her floor was on the tip of my tongue but the doubt kept me from doing it. What if we were wrong and she wasn’t there? I would be giving her false hope and I couldn’t do that.

Just because I could mind-link her, doesn’t mean she is actually in the casino. Anywhere within a mile is where she could be located.

So, as we were cleared to move up to the third floor, my body was protesting to just walk. “What if Penny isn’t up

here?” A warrior asked.

Alec and Carson froze. My wolf wasn’t having this. He was standing behind the warrior that asked. Leaning down, he growled in his ear. “This side of the casino is suits. The other side is regular rooms. We will tear this building apart till we find her.” The warrior’s body trembled as he bowed his head in respect. “When this is over, we will meet in my office.” Alec’s eyes were shifting as his wolf wasn’t happy about that question either.

«game men and in the same spots.” They announced over our ears.


What was the saying? Third time’s a charm? I was ready for some good luck so when Alec busted down the door, it took everything in my wolf to keep Tr

from kicking the doors down before they even finished shooting.

Alec and Carson looked at eachother before they kicked the door’s down. I heard a female scream from my left and I knew that was it. I didn’t need Alec to tell me this was the room Penny was in. I didn’t need the warriors to clear the room even. [ was going in.

“Colt?” Penny’s voice was music to my ears. My wolf pushed me forward as I walked into the bedroom where Penny was being kept.

“penny!” Running to her side, my hands grabbed her face and pulled it against mine. The moment our lips touched, I felt my body relax. All the tension released from my shoulders.

Penny’s tears fell between our lips. The salty favor was welcoming as I had to

keep my own tears at bay.

“I can’t believe you are here.” Penny tried to keep her voice from going full hysterics but I was being slightly pushed out of the way.

“I’m sorry, Alpha Colt but I need you to move.” The doctor came up beside me and started pushing buttons.

“What are you doing?” The girl from the side of the bed asked.

“Stopping the Pitocin. We don’t want to deliver here. Where is she at?” He was all business and started unhooking her I.V.

«This is my doctor. He is going to be taking over her while we are moving.

How far dilated is she?” Now that Penny was beside me, it was like the fog in my mind was clear. I could think

rationally and control my anger better.














###Chapter 0501

Rosalie bit her lip. "She was at a seven last tI checked." "When was the last tyou checked?" All the needles were out of Penny.

"Hour or so ago." Rosalie answered as Penny struggled to swing her legs off the bed.

"We are going to have company. Guards made it to the first floor and saw the bodies. You guys better get out of there now!" My heart started beating as Alec and I met eyes.

Alec frowned and looked at the door. "There is only one way out of here.” "Try to make it to the first floor. It will be easier to extract you." It was my turn to create the plan. "You heard him." Grabbing Penny's arm, I put it over my shoulder and the doctor did the son her other side. "Can you keep up?" I asked the nurse.

"Yeah, I'm good. Just don't leavebehind!" She wasn't my first priority but I wasn't going to leave her behind regardless. "Good. I need you to stay with Penny regardless of what happens. Do not leave her side and I will not leave you behind." Between the doctor and myself, we half carried Penny to the door. "You have about three minutes before she starts another contraction!" I heard the nurse yell as we made it to the door.

"Take the North stairs!" "Okay." The doctor grunted as he turned and tried to walk as quickly as possible.

"Are you okay?" I couldn't look at Penny because I was busy looking around but I wanted to make sure she was okay.

"I'm in the process of giving birth and a war is going on around me. I'm fucking great.” The sarcasm was very thick to the point that I even let out a little laugh. After all this, this woman wasn't freaking out.

Alec opened the door for us and we entered the stairwell. "Vin has exited the office with a group of warriors. You have about two minutes before he reaches you." "You boys probably only have a few minutes before they use the cameras to find us. Better get out of there!" Alec yelled as we went down the stairs.

We practically carried Penny down the stair but as soon as we hit the second landing, Penny clenched her body in pain. "FUCK!" "That was only two minutes." Rosalie said more to herself but it registered with me. This wasn't good.

"Proceed with clearing the buildings!" Carson screamed to the rest of the team as he held the door for us. At this point, Penny was being carried by us and we just ran.

"Get in the suit. We will have to hold them off." Alec ran ahead and opened the door for us.

"Moving now!" I heard Anthony command. noveldrama

We moved Penny to one of the bedrooms and pushed her in the middle of the bed. "Penny, I need to check you." Rosalie pulled out sgloves from her pocket.

The doctor put his backpack down and opened it. Pulling out multiple supplies and put a blood pressure cuff on Penny. "How are you doing?" He asked her.

"All things considering..." There was a large boom outside in the hallway. "....I'm okay." "Shit." I whispered and moved to stand in front of the door.

Our warriors had ran out into the hallway and their growls filled the room. "She is at a nine." I heard the concern in Rosalie's voice.

"Alpha, Luna is going to be delivering here. You are going to have to keep us safe and everyone out of here." .


Turning, I saw the fear in Penny's eyes. Rosalie was holding Penny's hand like her life depended on it and the doctor was busy getting his stuff Lets situation "I'm going to shut the door and give you sprivacy. Letknow when the babies are actually coming out." Walking over, wrapping my hands around her face, I kissed her as passionately as I possibly could. "You can do this. Stay strong for our kids. I love you." .

"I love you." Penny whispered as I let her go and walked out into the living room. Shutting the bedroom door, I made eye contact with Alec. He was the next defense as he watched the battle in the hallway.

"Another round is coming from both stairs! We are getting out of here and heading up towards you!" I heard in my ear.

"Keep our ears open for emergencies unless needed. Updates can clater. Once buildings are cleared, move to phase two.

All available warriors cto the casino for support!" Alec said as three of their warriors walked into the suite.

.

Alec took one and I took the other. He lunged at me. Normally, I would step aside but I didn't want any of them to go betweenand Penny. So, I allowed hi lowed him to tackle me. Wrapping my head around his neck. I tried to make it so we fell on the top of his head. Delivering multiple shots to his kidneys, we hit the floor hard. .

He struggled underas I kept my grip around his neck. At one point, he tried to flip over and it took everything into keep my hold. His movements beclabored until they slowed down.

.

Looking over at Alec, he sported a fresh slash to his chest but the other bel guy had a broken femur. Limping on one leg, it was all could do but was watch th battle until my guy finally gave it up. Alec blocked a right hook and slashed up his side. Without waiting a second, he shoved his claws deep into the guys neck as Vin walked in. .

Letting go of my guy, I had just enough tto snap his neck and stand up when Vin looked over at me.

"This is a fun surprise." "I believe you are standing in my casino and I am here to make you vacate it."









###Chapter 0502

Vin laughed at that. He stepped aside as more of his warriors cinto the suite. "Your casino?" "Yeah. All this was under the pack's name. Since Penny took over and is Alpha of that pack, it now belongs to me." Glancing behind Vin, Alec had his hands full but he was managing. His men showed up and two had joined his fight, leaving us to our own fight.

"You can try and take it from me." "They released their wolves! Watch out!" I heard over my ear as Vin got into attacking position.

He tried to move around in a circle but I kept my back towards the door. His eyes narrowed as he looked at the shut door and smirked. At the smoment, Penny let out a massive scream that distractedfor just a second. Vin lunged. Barely getting my hand in front of my face, I blocked that punch but Vin landed another punch to my gut.

Trying to fight without any air in my lungs, my fist were easily blocked. Vin got up quicker and sharp pain shot up my jaw. Before I could even react, three more punches landed on my temple, cheek and stomach. Vin grabbed my shirt and pickedup before tossingto the side.

"Pathetic." He laughed.

My vision was clouded but I knew in my heart he was going towards the door. Scrambling to my feet, Vin had just turned the door handle. He hasn't made it in by the tI got up. Running over, I grabbed a handful of his shirt and tossed him back into the livingroom. He wasn't ready forso his body fell down, over the chair that was there.

Not even looking at Penny, it was my turn to react. Chasing after Vin, he was ready for me. Blocking my right hook, he managed to get his knees up. Rolling to the side, Vin tossedoff but it was easy to land on my feet.

My wolf was out and ready for a fight. Vin was betweenand Penny but his focus was on me. There was a red line across his chest that my wolf managed to get him before he tossedto the side.

Vin looked down and looked at his blood. Grabbing the hem of his shirt, he completely took it off and laid it on the floor. Small amounts of blood oozed down his stomach but he acted like he didn't even notice.

"Oh good, your wolf cto play." We both moved at the stime. Dipping under his left hook, I got two punches to his stomach before he brought his knee up. Blocking it, I went to defense. Blocking punch after punch, we went into a skilled hand to hand combat. Where he moved left, I went right. His body sank after I went for a full right hook and his legs swept around.

My right foot didn't get high enough and he knockeddown. However, I was ready for it. Keeping with the momentum, my right foot moved faster around until it cinto contact with Vin's ear. His body rolled to the side. Not wanting to give an inch, my wolf took his claws and went for the kill but Vin kept rolling. Making Carpet the only thing that my claws cut. noveldrama

"That was slick! I'll give you that." Vin laughed as he shook the cob webs from his head.

"Why do you need to keep taking breaks? One hit and you can't handle it?" I taunted.

"I just want to make sure that you are okay so when I kill you, there will be no questions on who is the better man." Vin barely lifted part of his lip.

"Better man?" My eyes narrowed.

"To raise Penny's babies. What else?" Vin's eyes glimmered as he tried to makemad so I would make mistakes. However, having Penny close, my anger was minimal.


"Too bad your mind games don't work, Vin. You will be six feet under with everyone else that stood in my way." Anger flashed in his eyes before he initiated contact. This time, he faked going high and went low. Taking the blow to the side, I was able to deliver an elbow to his neck, hitting the presser point directly. His body instantly limped, allowingto bring my knee up into his stomach.

.

Out of the corner of my eye, something flashed. There was only a split second of realization of what it Halization was before his claws caround. I wasn't able to move out of the way quick enough. His claws ranked acrossed my stomach, leaving three slices in it's wake. .

.

Grabbing the back of his head, I gritted my teeth through the pain and slammed his forehead against myn knee. His body bounced back and my bodybounced foot tripped over the coffee table. Falling backwards, the glass table broke under my weight. Shattering into millions of pieces, sof which went into my back. .

.

Vin was on the move so I rolled to the side and got on my feet as soon as he did. His forehead was broken m down his was broken m open, making blood run do face. With a growl, he charged at me. Tackling me, we went over the back of the couch, landing on the floor. White hot pain shot up my thigh. .

Looking down, Vin had one claw penetrated completely through before he ripped it out completely.

"COLT!" Both of us looked over and I realized Penny had full view of us fighting. Panic was clear on her pale face. Rosalie was crying and the doctor was doing something I couldn't see.

"I'm the better man!" Vin said, raising his extended claws above me.

"NO!" Penny's eyes shifted and her aura exploded out of her and covered the entire suite. Vin was frozen above me. Using the chance, my claws shot up and into his chest. Moving deeper and deeper until his beating heart was in my hands.



















###Chapter 0503

Penny POV The fear of watching Colt fight Vin was something I had never experience before. My vagina was on fire and they kept tellingto push but all I could focus on was Colt. I couldn't push and watch him get gutted. Bring our babies into the world as their father died wasn't something I could let happen.

Being stuck to the bed was the worst part. I wanted to run to him. There was something insidethat kept trying to get out. It was like something was literally pushing against my chest. My wolf was growling, ready to attack at any moment.

The pressure got so great that I just couldn't fight it anymore. My mate was in trouble and my babies wanted out. Colt needed to be beside me. As soon as I decided to let the pressure out, there was this over whelming surge of power.

"NO!" It wasn't my voice but yet it was. There was an anger to it, a growl almost that made it almost inhuman. In my desperation, I pushed all the power out, wishing it was halter Vin.

To my pleasure, it did. Vin froze in place just long enough that Colt's hand shot forward. The satisfaction of Vin's eyes meeting mine with complete shock and then look back at Colt before his body fell was beyond satisfying. Something red was firmly in Colt's hands as he struggled to sit up.

"Colt!" There wasn't any weakness or concern in my voice. It was a fucking get up and get beside me. Pushing my newly found energy to him, I wanted him besideas I pushed these babies out.

"PENNY! FOCUS!" The doctor yelled at me. Both his hands were doing something between my legs that I tried not to think about.

"Con! You can do it! You need to get those babies out before he has to do a C-section!" Rosalie tried to plead to me.

"I'm here!" Colt staggered toand grabbed my hand. His hands were covered in blood.

"Wash your hands!" The doctor pulled his hands away and grabbed a water bottle. Opening the cap, he slowly poured the water over Colt's. Bloody water fell on the white carpet but it wasn't like this entire suite wasn't ruined already.

"I'm so sorry!" Colt said when he cback over.


"Alpha. Grab that blanket and be ready to catch." The doctor instructed before I could even respond. Another round of contractions pushed against me. My body screamed forto push this baby out.

"Push!" Rosalie urged and I was done resisting. With one push, the baby shot out into the doctor's arms.

Colt was barely ready when the doctor took the baby and instantly placed our little boy in his arms.

Grabbing the suction, he cleared his airway. The sweetest little cry brought tears to my eyes. I was so preoccupied with his little face that I barely witnessed Colt cutting the umbilical cord. Rosalie walked over and helped Colt swaddle him.

"Does he have a name?" She asked as Colt put him on my chest.

"Elijah Colt." We both said at the stime. Colt put his arm around my shoulders, makinglook up to him. Tears clouded my vision but I didn't need to see to respond to the kiss Colt placed on my lips.

"Be ready, here comes another one." The doctor said in a strained voice.

"May I?" Rosalie asked as she reached out.

“No, I have him.” I said, instantly. "Colt will helppush if needed." It wasn't that I didn't trust anything would happen to him but I wasn't about to let him out of my arms. Everything I had been through, was

for him and his siblings.

"Alpha, get another blanket. Luna...push!" Colt reached down and grabbed a blanket with one hand and used the other to helpcrunch. My wolf flashed before my eyes, givingthe strength to push my second baby boy out.


Again, the doctor instantly placed him in Colt's arms. After clearing his airway, Colt cut the umbilical cord. He didn't even cry but look around with the most grumpiest fast on.

"Little Cooper Brian isn't impressed to be here.” Colt laughed as he managed to swaddle Cooper by himself. There was so much emotion in his voice that I felt like my heart was going to explode.

"Little Elijah and Little Cooper. What beautiful names." Rosalie had a little tear run down her cheek.

.

"I'm sorry, Luna Penny, this isn't going to feel great." The doctor said before he shoved his arm inside me. He was up to his elbow with his face serunched up. The pressure that I felt like was nothing else. It already felt like an alien was insidewith the babies moving around, this was very unnatural. .

"What are you doing?" Colt asked, alarmed.

.

"The third baby becbreech. I'm grabbing it's legs to bring her out." He said in a strained voice. A few om seconds Vater, hovice arm slowly began to pulled out. Colt didn't need to be told a third time. Grabbing the blanket, he looked over at his little girl being born. .

.

With both boys in my arms, all I could do was wait and see. My wolf was front and center as she she helpedom Rushed, the last baby out. The last wave of fluid cout as I felt the relief that comes with being completely empty of babies. Her screams were pissed and filled the entire room. . noveldrama

"That's my girl." Colt cooed.

"What's her name?" Rosalie asked as she watched Colt swaddle his only daughter. After this, this will be his only children. Regardless of what he will say, I'm fucking done.

"Eliana Penelope." Colt answered. Just hearing my daughter's nfinally brought tears to my eyes. Colt loved her for just a moment before placing her in my arms.

"My family." Colt wrapped his arm aroundas he looked at me.

"Givea few mintues to clean you up." The doctor said. His voice broughtout of my bubble, makingaware of Alec and Carson standing at the doorway.














###Chapter 0504

"Colt." I said, simply.

"Hmm?" He didn't even look at me.

Nudging him, I finally got his attention and motioned towards the doorway. "Congraduations!" Carson said but didn't make a move to ccloser.

My first thought was my entire vagina was competely exposed to them. Not that this was in anyway sexual but it was still incredibly vonerable situation. However, their bodies were blocking any other men from seeing me.

"Thank you." I said when Colt failed to answer. “What is it?" "I'm sorry, Penny. Sir Joe was just spotted trying to make it to the airplane." Alec shifted uncomfortably.

"Colt can stay here and we can take him down." "No." I said instantly.

"No?" Colt looked atconfused.

"No. You will go and stop Joe." I said firmly. With all the babies in my arms, I couldn't move. Thankfully, Rosalie realized what I was trying to do and helped take the babies and lay them each on the bed in a row.

Sitting up more, my wolf was already working on healing me. There already was less burning than before. "You will go and you will kill Joe the way you killed Vin. You need to see this through. We both know that if you aren't the one to kill Joe that there will be this hole in your soul. After all he did to me... to us... I want you to be the one to kill him." "You just had the babies..." Colt stammered.

"I am more than capable of taking care of our babies. Rosalie will be withand so will the doctor. Leave a few warriors but I'm sorry but Colt, I don't need you." Colt looked taken aback. "I have learned that I am capable of handling myself. I am not just a luna but an alpha. No one is going to keepfrom going hwith


my babies. That is where I am going... home. You will kill Joe and then meetat home. I'm not the weak, sensitive luna you had. I'm powerful and will not stand to take you out of seeing this through. Be the strong domanate alpha. Show our emamies what happens when you fuck with us. End this today." I knew my eyes shifted. By the look of Colt's face, it was both beautiful and scary. This is what I meant to be an alpha. Putting other's needs before yours. I wanted Colt besidebut Colt needed to stand beside his allies in battle. He declared this war forand now he will end this war.

"I'm sorry but we need to go now or we will miss him." Alec said quietly but firmly.

"Colt?" Carson added after a moment of silence.

"Go. Making it back in one piece." "Are you sure?" Colt looked conflicted.

"Completely. Go." Reaching out, I gave him a little push.

"He will cback to you." Carson said with a smile. “Alpha Penny.” My eyes met his and I couldn't help the little blush that crept up on my cheeks. Yes, I wanted to go by alpha now but that didn't mean I wasn't still me. It felt good and I new the power that flowed freely in my veins.

Watching Colt follow Carson and Alec out of the suit, I tried to push as much energy and power fromto him as I could. He needed it to not only heal but to be able to beat Joe. There was an brief moment that I felt alone but knowning that these babies neededwas more than enough motivation to stay focused.

"Let's get you home, alpha." The doctor smiled at me. "Letcheck the babies out first." "Sorry, doc. We need to leave now. There is a small opening and we need to get going. Jace is almost in postion for imediate extraction." "Penny, can you walk?" Rosalie asked in a worried voice. noveldrama

Swinging my legs to the side of the bed, there was only one way to know. "I guess we will find out." With Rosalie on one side and the doctor on the other, we gotstanding on my own two feet.

"I think the best way to go about this was to wrap all the babies tightly against her chest." Rosalie said as he pulled out an extremely long wrap.


“I like that idea.” The doctor said. I was a little uneasy on my feet but my wolf instantly pushed herself forward.

"I'm going to get the wrap set and then we will put the babies in." Rosalie said as she started wraping me. The doctor started cleaning up his supplies.

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the warrior check his watch and then touch his ear. "I'm sorry but we need to go!" .

"Okay." Rosalie said as she picked up the first baby and put Elijah in place! Next cCooper and then Elaina. "How do they feel? Snug?" .

"Very much so." I said. I didn't need my hands on them but it felt wrong to not put them there.

.

"Good. Let's go!" The warrior said as he turned. The doctor took the front and Rosalie and followed him. Dead bodies covered almost every inch of the hallway. .

"I'm going to need ssupport going down the stairs." I said loudly to whoever was listening.

"Keep going. I got her." .

How the fuck they got up behindwas beyondbut I barely had tto see who it was before they slipped their arm around mine. The massive ama arm on my left toldthere was two warriors around me. .

"Rosalie?" I asked as I was practically carried down the stairs.

"I'm here!" I heard behind me.

"Do not leave her behind!" I commanded. It caughtoff guard but everyone aroundnodded like they didn't have a choice but to listen.

When the door opened at the bottom on the stairs, I got my first glimps at what a war looked like.















###Chapter 0505

"Fucking shit." This warrior said we he grabbed my arm and took off. We took a few steps before something that looked like a wolf but didn't at the stime, jumped in front in front of us.

He tried to turn us to the right but another one got in front of us again. "What are those things?" Rosalie sounded terrified but I didn't have the tto look at her.

I had literally pushed three babies out ofand now I was standing here, trying to run for our lives. The warrior holding my arm let go and got into a fighting position in front of me. "Follow the doctor and don't stop!" He growled before he jumped into a fight. "This way!" I barely had tto ask where when I felt like my body was being ripped to the left.

"What about them?" I yelled. I looked back just in ttoo see the weird looking wolf slash his claws across the warrior's chest. "We can't wait! You are our top priority!" My wolf didn't like that. Stomping her feet, she wasn't going to let this go. "NO!" I growled and ripped my arm from his grip. Turning around, I wasn't sure what I was doing but my wolf did.

Taking the front, I was pushed to the back for the first tin my life. It was like I was watching a movie but yet, I wasn't. My body let out a massive authoritive growl so loud that the windows shook at the casino. The entire battle field on the back lot, completely froze. Thankfully, my warriors used the distraction and got the upper hand.

"Please! Can we go now?" The doctor touched my arm and tried to getto move. My wolf whipped my head around and growled at him. "I have orders to keep you and those babies safe. Please letdo my job." "Let's go." There was a huge part ofthat wanted to stay and fight but the three little babies toldmy priorities needed to change.


My wolf keptin the back. She was handling the running after just giving birth. She was powerful and kept trying to heal me. Still, I doubt I would have been able to keep up if it wasn't for her. There wasn't any shoes on my feet and the shirt that I was wear was more like a massive dress.

Tree branches slapped at my exposed legs and stabbed the souls of my feet but my wolf didn't let up. She stayed along side of the doctor with another warrior and Rosalie just ahead of us.

"Turn right!" The warrior said as we cup to a clearing. There was once a dirt road that now was covered in more weeds than anything else. The forest was slowly swallowing it whole.

A white SUV sat idling with exhaust rising behind it. The side door opened and another warrior leaned out. "Hurry up!" It was only then that I realized we were being followed. My wolf looked behind to see a dozen or so wolves headed towards us. Foam was dripping from their mouths, making the entire forest seem infectious.

The doctor and warrior helpedin before Rosalie jumped in and the doctor followed us, shutting the door. The other warrior got in the passenger's seat before we started peeling out. noveldrama

"GO! GO! GO!" The doctor said. He had one hand on the wall and the other hand firmly around my arm. There wasn't any seats in the back, only hospital grade bedding material. Looking around, I realized this was literally a hospital on wheels. The different size cuffs bouncing off the walls and birthing materials maderealize that this was meant for me. They created it in case I had to give birth in a car.

"We aren't stopping until we are back on pack lands." The driver said. His voice sounded familiar. Looking over, Jace looked back atand smiled. "Good to see you, Penny." My wolf letcback in front. It was such a weird experience that I was a little dizzy at first. "It is so good to see you, too." "How are the babies?" The doctor asked as he leaned over and pulled the wrap back a little.

"Is it safe to take them out?” I asked, unsure if we were still being followed.

“I can't guarantee we are safe until we are on pack lands but I don't believe we are being followed.” The smile quickly left Jace's face as he becan alpha again.

"I didn't get to assess them so I need to do it now. They need their shots and we need to check for fluid." The doctor and Rosalie started unwrappingand pulling the babies out.

.

Elijah was the first baby they pulled f out. It was easy to identify him as he was the only one only one with a Sirthmark across his neck. It almost looked like a dragon, which was pretty badass. I was a little proud of that. .

.

He was just looking around, taking in everything that was happening. The doctor pulled him off to the side and started listening to his heart cate.m Rosalie pulled Cooper out next and did the same. He was still glaring at her with burrowed eyebrows. If the grumpy emoji was a face, it would be his. I had to smirk at that. He was even trying to push Rosalie's hand away as she tried listening to his heart. .

.

The wrap was loose enough that I took it the rest of the way off. Little Elaina was not making any sounds and had hepeyes closed. My internal bells were going off as I quickly unwrapped her. "Something is wrong." I said quietly as I looked at my motionless daughter. .

"Give her to me.” The doctor said instantly and practically ripped her out of my hands. Her blue color brought tears to my eyes as the doctor listened to her breathing.
















###Chapter 0506

 Colt POV It felt wrong to leave Penny but she was right. I needed to see this through.

It wasn’t that I didn’t trust the boys to kill Joe, I wanted to be the one to do it.

Penny’s blood and birthing fluids were still on my hands but so was the blood from Vin’s heart. It sat firmly in my hand. Picking it up on my way out was more of an impulse thing. I wanted to return it back to Joe as a present. As a fuck you to everyone who thought they could go up against me.

Getting into a vehicle, Carson sped away quickly. “Do we have any backup?” I asked.

“Some. They are still clearing the buildings and picking off the mutants.

However, we haven't found where they are making them. After we kill Joe, we will need to follow the train and see where it leads.” Carson said as he turned so fast that the car got on two wheels.

“What are you going to do with the heart?” Alec asked.

“Give it back to Joe.” Shrugging, I wasn’t sure they would understand but both of them broke out laughing.

“I’m sorry but Penny was badass today.” Carson looked back at me quickly before turning back around.

“I have a feeling things are going to be changing.” The warmth that filled my soul was something I never expected.

| “Shit! There is the plane and it is running!” Alec pointed ahead. It was a smaller plane but was big enough to make it a private plane.

“Fuck.” My heart started beating faster. “Get me up there. We can’t let him leave!” Carson drove on the grass and over to the back of the runway. The plane had started moving, making the resistance so

heavy that the car started swerving. noveldrama

“We aren’t going to make it!” Alec yelled as he held onto Carson’s head rest.

“We better make it!” I yelled back. My hand was on the door handle. “Go Faster!” I yelled.

As we went faster, the plane was

EE picking up speed too. “How are you going to stop it?” Carson yelled back at me, - “I'have a grenade. Just get me close enough I can throw it and pop a hole in it!” I tried with all my might to push the door open but against the force of the plane and how fast we were going, I couldn’t do it. I was forced to take off my vest and roll the window down.

With the grenade in one hand, I pushed my torso out of the window. As hard as the wind tried to blow me out of the car, Alec had ahold of my legs to keep me from doing just that.

“We need to get closer!” Screaming, I hoped Carson heard me. I hadn’t pulled the pen but I didn’t think I could get it close enough without the wind

stopping it.

Carson heard me and slowly moved | over until we were adjacent to the rear tire. “This might end badly! As soon as I throw it, slam on your breaks!” I yelled.

I couldn’t hear if they responded from how loud the plane was but this was my only shot. Putting the pen between my teeth, I ripped it out in one motion.

With everything I had, my arm pulled back and threw the grenade as hard as I could into the rear tire hatch.

Carson instant got on the breaks, making my body bend over. The car slamming into my stomach, taking all the air out of me. Not wanting to miss, my eyes stayed on the plane.

Right as the front wheels pulled off, an explosion made the plane jump before

a chunk of metal bounced off the runway. Complete relief flooded me as the plane touched back down and skidded to a stop, sideways.

“Are you okay?” Carson asked. The car had stopped but I coudn’t move. I wasn’t sure if I was stuck or if I still couldn’t breath from the door being shoved in my stomach.

“Um RL Carson got out and came around as I let out a few coughs. “That will leave a mark.” He said as he opened the door and helped me get out of the window.

Alec had walked up as I pulled my body free. “Look.” The three of us turned our heads in time to see half a dozen men exit from

the plane. “Is Joe there?” I asked, searching the men for someone familiar.

“There he is.” Alec muttered as a seventh man exited the plane. He had stopped to look at us. Taking off his jacket, he started rolling his sleeves as he walked down the stairs.

“Where are our men? This is two against one.” Alec asked quietly.

Alec was on my left and Carson was on my right. Before we started walking towards them, I went to the car and got Vin’s heart.

“Three minutes out.” Carson muttered as I got back into line.

“We need to stall then.” I said and we started walking towards them. He had six warriors but the three of us were

alphas. Still, two against one was never the best odds and with Joe in there, who know how this was going to turn | out.

“This wasn’t how I pictured us meeting again.” Joe said as he stopped walking. We were fifty yards between us.

“This wasn’t by my choice. I told you what was going to happen.” I said firmly. My wolf wanted to be in front but I kept his at bay.

“I'must admit. I underestimated you.” Joe chuckled.

“I believe this belongs to you.” For more dramatic affect, I pulled the heart back and tossed it at him. It landed with a thug a few feet in front of Joe, rolling a few times so loose gravel stuck to the sticky heart. Joe's face

hardened as he stared at it. “I stayed true to my word and I killed Vin like I told you I would.”















###Chapter 0507

"It's that a nice touch." All the playfulness was out of Joe's voice.

"I'll admit, it felt good too. Penny is back in my possession and Vin is dead. The last thing forto handle is you." "I am the head of the mafia family in Italy. Do you really think you can just killand walk away like nothing happened?" Joe almost sounded like he was stalling.

"You are going to avenge Vin's death regardless. At least this way, whoever takes after you will hopefully learn what you couldn't. I'll give them the swarning. Leave my family alone and I'll leave you alone. Fuck withand find out." Joe held out his hands and smiled. “You are assuming you will beat me. There is seven of us and only three of you." "Three alphas and backup is coming. Your tis running out." I was itching to get my hands on Joe. Not that I had a real anger towards him the way I did Vin. However, he forced Penny into giving him her blood.

"I never laid a hand on her. You still want to kill me?" "You aided Vin. You didn't return Penny tobut was going to use her blood for your own personal gain. A gain at the loss of humans. People our ancestors swore to protect. You run a mafia. It might have morals but you still crossed mine." "It's unfortunate you see it that way." Joe sighed. noveldrama

It was finally time. "If it helps you, I will be happy to send Vin's heart back with yours to explain the conditions. I will even label who's is who out of the goodness of my heart." I knew that was a low blow but I was done talking and ready for a good fucking fight. My wolf had healedand the energy that Penny gavewas flowing.

It was like a drug in my veins. Her power was unlike anything else I had felt. As soon as she decided to embrace her alpha blood, it made my wolf that much stronger too. He had grown a few inches in both height and width.

My wolf was at the surface already so when Joe showedhis fangs, my wolf easily shovedto the side. That wasn't enough for him though. He completely shifted so within seconds, I was standing on all

fours.

Alec and Carson both shifted and they were growling beside me. Looking at the seven wolves in front of us, I finally heard the stomping of our backup. As soon as they broke the tree line, Joe's men attacked.

I watched as my wolf took off, meeting Joe half way. Both of us got on our hind legs. My paw slapped away his jaws and bit down on his shoulder. Blood filled our mouth but Joe got his foot up. Pushing against our stomach, he pushed away. Rolling to the side, my wolf was up and ready for more.

Staying low to the ground, we started circling eachother. He knew he wasn't going to get out of here alive but he was damn sure wanting to take a piece ofwith him.

Joe stepped once more to the side but slipped slightly. Glancing down, he realized he slipped on a pool of blood from one of his warriors. He had transformed back into his human form. The head was a good five feet from the body that was still leaking blood. It was so crudely ripped off that chunks of flesh hung off his body.

Using the distraction, we jumped towards him. Joe was quicker than I expected. He got low and using his back legs, pushed us off and away from him before rolling over. This time, he jumped and we were on the bottom.

His claws swiped at our face, leaving three claw marks on our cheeks. His leg was on the ground for stability, allowing us to push against it so hard that it snapped out of place. His body fell and we rolled on top of him.

It was our turn to attack. He kept his paws against us from biting his neck. Using the next best thing, our claws slashed across his stomach. There was a unique satisfaction of watching his stomach fall out of him. Next cthe intestines.









###Chapter 0508

As soon as we drove up to the train, the first thing I noticed was our men. Everyone was done with their assignments and were standing around. A group of women of all ages were cuddled together, sitting on the ground.

"Alpha." Hank's beta cup toinstantly and bowed. For the life of me, I couldn't remember his name.

"These are all the women that were freed. All will need medical attention but nothing life threatening." "Get them in a vehicle and get them back to my pack for treatment. They will be interviewed and provided for there.” I commanded instantly.

"Okay. I will be traveling with them to assure their safety." I noticed more than once he kept looking back at them with a weird expression on his face. "Hank is on the train, waiting for you to arrive. All warriors are instructed to board the train and be prepared for where ever it goes." "Good. Take swarriors with you." I said and walked off. I could hear him command people around but my attention on was on Carson and Alec as they were a few steps ahead of me. Sof the men were sitting down, talking and laughing like the fight was already over. Maybe there was so many men that it was easier than I expected. Though, Joe and Vin might of thought I wouldn't have found all this. I wasn't even sure what to do with all this land and newly acquired casino. Maybe I could turn this into ssort of camp for training young alphas or teens learning to fight. I'd have to ask Penny since this was technically her land.

Walking up to the engine, I almost had to plug my ears with how loud it was. The metal bars were cold under my hands as I climbed the ladder. "Hank." I said as soon as I cinto view.

"Congratulations!” Hank had a huge smile on his face as he cup to me. I was expecting a handshake but he pulledinto a full hug.

It was a little awkward but there wa still something comforting about it.... not that I could show that. "Thanks, man." I said and gave him a few slaps on the back.


Hank letgo but held onto my shoulders. The look on his face was like a proud grandpa. After a few seconds, he letgo and went back to the train. “Ready to start this beast and find out there she goes?" Alec and Carson were both standing off to the side with their arms folded. Alec was rather amused and Carson didn't even try to hide the smile on his face. "Let's go." Rolling my eyes at them, I walked over to the window and looked out.

Hank pulled on the string, making the horn blare. All the men quickly jumped onto an open car. The last few men had to run a little before jumping since Hank wasn't waiting. The train moved slowly down the tracks, givinga beautiful view of the landscape. noveldrama

"Do we have an idea of where this goes?" Carson asked.

"Not a single one. I had someone run down the tracks sbut after ten miles, it kept going so he turned back around." “I have a feeling it just runs in a complete circle. If this is where they make the mutants, then they board them on the train to transport them to where they can put them into vehicles and take them where ever they need to go." I didn't even bother looking at them as I spoke.

“We need a fucking party for the men and for everyone when we get back.” Carson said as he yawned.

"How are you yawning?” Hank bickered like they were kids.

"Didn't sleep the best last night." "The day is almost over so I guess you can sleep on the way home." I looked back just in tto see Hank shake his head. "I'm not as young as I used to be. Granted, this is the most fun I've had in years.' "I'll seco-" Hank started but Alec cut him off.


"Look." Pointing out the window, Alec saw a building in the distance. "Men. Be ready." Carson said. His tone instantly changed to that of an alpha ready to go into battle.

.The train started slowing as we creeped our way closer and closer.

bend As soon as we got around the bend, an incredibly old event denter stood beforeus. The paint was chipping, part of the roof was missing and most of the windows were broken. Still, it looked like a lot of traffic had taken place to have the doors opened to their fullest capability. .

The train cup level to the cement. The cool air almost made this a spookier place, not to mention the faint cries I could hear. "You hear that?" I asked anyone.

"Sure do." Alec muttered under his breath.

Taking a deep breath, it was now or never. "Let's go." I was the first one to step off the train, signaling everyone else to do the same. Not wanting to go in alone, I waited for the rest of the warriors to be ready with guns in their hands.

.

No one spoke a word but as soon as I saw everyone was ready, I took the lead and walked into the vestibule avers Dust covered the floor but the footprints and paw prints were etched into it. Swere fresh and shad another lay of dust that indicated how old they were. .

.

Alec snapped his fingers, getting my attention. As soon as I met his eyes, he pointed into the next room next room om Following his direction, my eyes landed a chain link cage with mutants in it. Swere on the floor, dead or asleep. Other's didn't realize we were here so they were just licking their paw or pacing. .

Wondering what they would do, I signaled everyone to wait and I walked into the room.







###Chapter 0509

Instantly, their noses lifted and their eyes met mine. As soon as sstarted growling, the one asleep woke up and joined in. By the looks at the others being trampled, they must be dead. Not surviving the transformation.

The chain-link held up against their protest. I wished their was a cure but I doubt anything would change what they did to these humans. Their DNA was completely altered. It would take years to achieve that, if it was even possible.

After a few moments, Alec and everyone else started piling in. My attention was brought back to my surroundings as I kept looking around. The lights were out, making it really dark and only getting darker. Thankfully, wolves had excellent night vision or this would really be difficult.

"Alpha." I heard someone whisper. I had started walking down a hallway when they tried to get my attention from behind.



Not verbally answering but I turned and looked to see who it was. All eyes were on a single man as he looked into the glass of double doors. My curiosity got the best ofand I turned back to see what he was looking at.

He stepped aside so I could get a good look. Cleaning the dust off the window, I got a good look. It was one of the main rooms. Tables were lined up with looked like hospital beds in the middle. The whole scene remindedof when humans would give blood for the Red cross but this was much for unorganized. It wasn't until I saw another cage that I got concerned.

"Be ready." I muttered and pushed the door open. noveldrama

I was expecting more growling but I was met with cries of scared women and men yelling, 'stay back'. I was still trying to comprehend what I was seeing when the overhead lights flickered on. It took a few times and sdidn't work but it allowed us to see the entire room.


"They are still human." Alec whispered in shock.

"Why are women where?” Carson asked. “I thought the wolves were all men?" As much as I wanted to let them out, I wanted to know what they knew. Quietly, I walked up to the men since they didn't seem as scared. "Have you been injured?" I asked, looking at their naked bodies for injuries.

"No! Stay back!" One of them held up his fist like he was going to fight us. By the look of them, they haven't had a decent meal in days.

"I'm not here to hurt you." I wasn't sure how to help them though either. "Can you tellwhat happened here?" "They kidnapped us and brought us here. They would tie us down and inject us with something." He shook his head like he couldn't bare to say anymore.

"What did they want with the women?” Alec asked, coming up beside me.

"They did something to them. Put rabies or something in them! They would unhook us and put a girl out there to see what they would do. They would always kill the girl and that would make them happy. After that, we never saw them again." Another guy said. He had track marks all down his arm, missing a few teeth and even a few toes.

"Where were you kidnapped from?" I asked, wanting more information.

"W-we were all homeless. He cup to our camp and offered drinks. Next thing we knew woke up here and naked.” "Is that all you know?" I pushed.















###Chapter 0510

Fighting off my wolf was more difficult than I imagined. All the humans listened and obeyed as they got released. After giving us their nand location they wished to be dropped off at, they were blindfolded from abandoned material found in another part of the center.

Not that they trustedbut I didn't want them to see I was a wolf too. Their experience was a terrible one and we would get more resistance if they knew what we really were. If they fought me, they would get hurt and trying to save their lives were what I was after. noveldrama

"Did you get ahold of your bank?" Alec cup behind me. I was so preoccupied by watching the humans get loaded that I didn't even hear him.

"Yeah. I have all the accounts being set up right now." "I got off the phone with Kristen. We want to go half in with you." Looking back, Alec was just standing with his hands in his pockets, like this was another normal day. "I appreciate that." "She said something else...." Alec trailed off. This time, he looked atand I could see it wasn't the best news. "What happened?" Turning my body, I faced him, ready for the blow he was going to give me. "She had gotten a call from Jace. He had picked up Penny and the doctor was examining the babies. Elaina had swallowed sfluid. She was unresponsive for an undetermined amount of time. Kristen got a helicopter in the air and they are schedule to get everyone within the hour. The doctor was able to clear her and it appears she is okay but they are going to be keeping her in the hospital for awhile for supervision." It was like another punch to my gut. Closing my eyes, I had to walk away. If they weren't already dead, I would make their death more painful. Pulling out my phone, I looked up Penny's nand hit call.

"Oh, Colt." Penny sighed. "Did Kristen talk to you?" "She told Alec. Is Elaina okay?" "I don't know. She is alive if that is what you mean. She hasn't opened her eyes but her airway sounds clear-ish. There is still a little moister sound in there. He thinks she might have inhaled and swallowed sfluid. Since we couldn't properly address each baby, she didn't get cleaned out." By the end of Penny speaking, her voice cracked. I couldn't resist the tears that plagued my eyes. “She's your daughter. She will be strong

and will fight this. You stay strong momma. Stay strong for our daughter and for our sons. I will be there as soon as I can be." "They are sending a second helicopter for you. I need you with me. Your job there is done. It's tyou chwith me." Penny said instantly. It sounded like she pushed the tears back and forced herself to toughen up.

"I'll be ready." "Kristen did ask that maybe you could convince Alec to go htoo." There was a little laughter to her voice, which madesmile. Sniffling, it even brought a small smile to my face. "I'll bring him htoo." "Thank you for killing them." Her voice was small, embarrassed she wanted them dead. "I saved their hearts to send back to whoever is in charge now. Hopefully, all this will be done." In the distance, I could hear the helicopter over the phone. "I have to go." "Callwhen you get to the hospital. Letknow how she is. Are the boys okay?" I asked, quickly.

"The boys are good. I'll let you know. Love you." "Love you too." I said and a second later, my phone said call ended. Bringing it down, I felt a sense of loss for sreason. As I put my phone back in my pocket, I heard shuffling of footsteps behind me. As much as I wanted to be alone, I knew that wasn't going to happen just yet.

“Alec filledin." Carson didn't try to touchor even ccloser.

"I'm getting on that helicopter." It was more of a dare to argue kind of tone.

"Take Alec with you. You need family right now. Hank and I will finish all this. Just givethe bank stuff and I'll see everything is completed." .

Well, that solved that issue. Pulling out my phone, I sent Carson the nof my contact with my password to him before putting my phone away again. "I sent it." .

"My daughter swallowed fluid when she was born. After a short stay, she was released and she was incredibly healthy after that." Turning around, I looked at Carson. I wasn't sure what I wanted to say. After opening and closing my mouth a few times, Carson just nodded in understanding.

"All the humans are loaded up." A warrior cup and stood between Carson and I. He looked between us like he knew he interrupted something.

"Good. Get the train moving. I want a team left here. Collect all theevidence and then flatter this place. I it want to be complete ashes before we leave here." I said, firmly. He nodded and walked off. .

"I didn't find anything but I did find where they were mixing it all. I have pictures of it all." Carson muttered.

"Thank you." I said, quickly before I chickened out of saying it.

Carson looked into my eyes and knew what I was talking about. “Brian would be proud of you. I know I am.” .

I couldn't respond but nodded.

Carson put his hand on my shoulder for a second, squeezed and let go again We stood in silence and watched as Hank finalized his count and got on the train. After blaring the horn, he took off slowly. .

Alec walked up to me. Carson nodded at Alec and walked away to get things going inside. "Helicopter will be here within the hour." "You're coming with me." I stated. Alec raised an eye brow in response.












###Chapter 0511

"I'm what?" "With me. Kristen's orders. You can argue with her." Alec rolled his eyes and folded his arms. “Wouldn't doany good. Funny how she didn't tellthat when I was on the phone with her." "She isn't stupid." That brought a little smile to my face. Knowing my sister was giving Alec hell still was something that madeproud for sreason.

"No. She is a lot of things but stupid isn't one of them." We fell into a semi comfortable silence as we watched evidence get brought out. “A-alpha?" A warrior looked uncomfortable at a crate he was carrying.

"What?" "Um..." He didn't want to say what it was so instead, he walked up toto show me. Inside, there was multiple bags of blood with Penny's non them. This was all the blood they had taken but hadn't used yet.

My first thought was to save it so we could give it back to her but it wasn't kept cold and couldn't be any good. “Leave it here.” The warrior put the crate on the ground and walked away. “What are you going to do with it?" Alec asked.

"Trying to decide how to dispose of it." Keeping the anger from rising was harder said than done.

"You can just dump it out." Alec suggested.

"That just seems...." I wasn't sure how to describe it. Wasteful wasn't the right word. Putting her blood in the dirt seemed dirty and almost disrespectful. I couldn't risk just putting it in the center and hoping it is destroyed in the fire. We couldn't bury the bags in case they were ever found and something was done with the blood.

"We can spill the blood on the front doors then put the gas on top of it. That way it's like she is burning down the building." "What gas?" We had slighter fluid but nothing like what he was describing.noveldrama

"They found an abandoned gas station they have been using to fill their vehicles with. A few guys grabbed a couple of the cans and brought them with us. They assumed we would be burning shit." "I'm lighting the fire so they have until the helicopter gets here to clear the building. We are not missing our flight." Alec nodded and walked to warn the guys to pick it up. I wasn't sure what to do so I just stood there. Every few minutes, I checked my phone for an update from Penny. More than once, I pulled up her nand was going to hit call but just clicked my phone off and put it back into my pocket.

After what felt like eternity, the distance sounds of the helicopter made my anxiety flare up a little. “Everything is ready.” Alec said.

As if right on cue, the train crumbling around the corner. Grabbing the crate, I walked over and set it down by the front doors. Pulling out my pocket knife and cutting the top off, it was easy to spill the blood on the wooden frame. The wood was so old that the blood stuck to it and seemed into it instantly.

Once I was finished, a warrior cup toand handedthe gas without saying a word. The helicopter was approaching quickly, ready to land on the old parking lot. Spraying the gas everywhere was almost satisfying in itself. After all the warriors were loaded into the train, I took the lighter and lit it.

For sreason, I just looked at the fire for a moment before I touched it to the gas. There was a small blast as the fire spread quickly up the side of the building. I had to step back quickly and make sure I still had eyebrows after that.

.

No one spoke as we just watched how quickly it eloped in flames. Once I was satisfied the blood was om mpletely burned, did I put my head down and walked towards the helicopter. Carson would see to it that nothing was left. My job here was done and it would honestly be a long tbefore I made it back to his land. .

Alec wasn't far behindso I waited until he was in the helicopter before I looked one last tat the massive fire before stepping off the land for the last time. Alec brought the hearts with him so there was nothing lefthere to do.

Once I was buckled in, the helicopter took off. My eyes didn't leave the fire until it was out of sight completely. More than once, I kept checking my phone for updates but seeing as I didn't have any bars, the likely hood ofgetting an update was slim to none.

Being confined to this tiny moving room, I was left to only my thoughts to keepsane. Closing my eyes, I just pictured my babies from when I first met them. Cutting each of their umbilical cords and the love in Penny's eyes.

.

Only when the helicopter dropped suddenly, did I open my eyes. I was home. There was a cart waiting off to el the side to take us to the hospital. My hand firmly gripped the handle to the door the whole way down. So, when it finally touched down, I jumped out and practically ran to the golf cart. .

Thankfully, Alec was right behindso my warrior took off instantly. To my pleasure he drove like we were being chased so we got there very quickly.

"Alpha." I was greeted at the door by the doctor and a few nurses.

"How's my daughter?" I asked, skipping pleasantries.

.

Thankfully, he turned and walked in front of me, leadingto her. "She is okay. We have her on the monitors. We were able to get the rest of the fluid out and do a full assessment. were to getvife!, I'm

happy to say that all three babies are going to be okay." He opened the door forto go in. Still, I wasn't prepared for what I saw. .













###Chapter 0512

My little girl was laying in a small crib with different tubes and wire coming out of her. She was breathing on her own but there was an oxygen mask on her face. It was so tiny, like the size of my hand. A little blanket was laid acrossed her.

I was vaguely aware of the doctor behind me as I reached down and touched her little hand. Her body instantly responded to my touch. Her arms and legs started moving around and even her eyes blinked open to look at me. My emotions were caught in my throat as I looked at her. It felt like a ball was keeping me from saying anything. Nothing would come out but I felt complete joy looking at her.

“T'wondered if she would wake up to your touch. Already a daddy’s girl.” The doctor laughed to himself.

After clearing my throat, I finally find my voice. “When can she go home?” ép “That depends on her. Once I see her stats improving and she drinks an ounce of milk, she can go home.” “When is she due to eat?” I hated that didn’t know my own daughter's schedule.

“Actually, if you can get her to eat, that would be great. Let me get the nurse in here to get her ready for you to hold her and bring a bottle.” The doctor looked at me for permission. After I nodded, he walked out of the room.

“Hear that? Daddy get's to feed you.”

As soon as the word daddy was out of my mouth, there was this warm that spread over my body. €» “Colt?” Penny’s voice entered my head from the mind-link.

“Hey. I just got here and came straight to Elaina’s room.” I felt a little guilty for not talking to Penny sooner. &» “Okay, we will be right there.” Penny didn’t cut the link but pushed it to the side.

“Hello, Alpha. I understand you are going to feed Miss. Elaina?” The nurse walked in and immediately put hand sanitizer on her hands.

“Yes.” “Perfect. If would actually be helpful if you would like to grab a pillow and sit down on the chair. You're not wearing

a shirt so that is perfect. Skin to skin is extremely important for bonding.” It wasn’t my place to argue with her on this. She knew what my daughter needed better than I did right now so I did as she asked. I wasn’t sure what she was doing to Elaina but I didn’t have to wait long.

Sitting in the chair with the pillow under my arm, the nurse brought over my daughter. She was tightly wrapped in a blanket and was fussing. Her little cries broke my heart. As soon as the nurse put her in my arms, Elaina stopped crying and started cooing.

“She is going to have you wrapped around her finger.” The nurse laughed at the sight. The door opened and Penny walked in, carrying two other babies. “Hello, Alpha Penny! We were

going to see if Alpha Colt would be able to feed Elaina.” She walked over and grabbed a little bottle and brought it back to me.

Taking it from her, I brought it awkwardly up to her lips. Not entirely sure what to do, I rubbed the bottle on her lips to see if she would open up.

Instantly, she pulled the bottle into her mouth and started sucking away.

“Oh good!” Penny smiled and sat down on the couch.

“Let me clean the crib out and you can put the boys in there if you wish. Do you need any supplies in here?” The nurse asked Penny.

“No. I don’t think so. Thank you.” Penny smiled at the nurse.

She didn’t verbally respond but nodded

and started clearing out the crib. Once she was done, she quietly left the room.

“She is doing really well.” Penny said after a few minutes.

“How are you doing?” Looking over at her, Penny was looking at our daughter. The circle under her eyes were dark and her entire face looked sunken.

“Weak. Tired. The doctor said they took too much blood and now my hemoglobin is very low. I don’t want our babies out of my eyesight.” Looking back at Elaina, I couldn’t blame her. Everything that happened was incredibly traumatizing. I had opened my mouth to say something when a knock sounded on the door.

“Come in.” I said after Penny nodded at me.

Kristen stuck her head in to see if it really was okay for her to come in.

“How is everyone?” She asked as she opened the door more. Alec slipped in behind her and closed the door. He stayed at the door with his arms crossed. noveldrama

“Still processing I think.” I answered for us.

Kristen came up to me and looked down. She didn’t try to touch Elaina but just smiled. “She is too perfect.” “She is.” I agreed.

Kristen moved to sit beside Penny.

Instantly, Penny handed her one of the babies but I couldn’t see who it was.

“These boys have quite the job of keeping our girls safe!” Kristen laughed but it was the emotion in her voice that made me look at her. She avoided my looked but I could tell she knew I was looking at her.

“That they do.” Penny agreed.

“So, listen. I really do understand the traumatic experience you have been through. I completely understand you wanting to lock yourselves away in your house with your babies and not let anyone in. I really do but Penny, you are struggling and need some help.

Obviously you have Colt but there is still stuff that needs to be done. Can I come over with Adalynn and help you take care of the babies? I'm not staying all day, just while Colt is at work and | then I'll leave. I'll do all the laundry | and dishes. I'll cook and clean and you

Sw» "19 BONUS can just lay in bed and hold your babies. Let me help you.”

















###Chapter 0513

"I wasn't going to argue. I'm too tired to argue. Not only have I been too uncomfortable to sleep, I have been living in fear someone will take my babies. Now that I know they are safe, I just want to sleep." Penny gave Kristen a small smile.

Elaina pushed the bottle from her mouth. Setting it down, I pulled her up so she was on my shoulder and tried to burp her. "You're good at that.” Kristen said to me.

"Only doing what I saw in the movies. I have no idea if I am doing it right." As if Elaina had the perfect timing, she let out a very large burp. "That's my girl." I chuckled as she curled her head in my shoulder.

"She didn't do that for me." Penny frowned.

“She is a daddy's girl.” I said back as I leaned back and got comfortable. There already was a soft spot in my heart for her.

Alec's phone started ringing. He looked down at it and then walked out of the room. I just wanted him go, conflicted on what I should do. My heart wants to say with Penny and the babies but I knew I still have a responsibility to the pack to finish this. "Penny, I know you don't feel good but there are sthing you will need to be told and make decisions on. Those obviously don't need to be done right now but when you are ready." Penny sighed. She handed the other boy to Kristen and stood up. She started walking to the bathroom. "Tomorrow. I'm ready to go hand sleep." Closing the door behind her, it was just Kristen and I left in the room.

"Thank you for offering to help, Ice." "We are family. The only family I have. Of course I would do anything to make you sure both are okay." "Is it weird to think a year ago you were stressing about finding your mate?" "Seems like a lifetago." Ice laughed. "Alec said that Alpha Carson wants to have a party to celebrate before everyone leaves." "He mentioned it." I vaguely remembered that.

“I'll get it all figured out and organized." Ice said as Penny cout of the bathroom.

"Organize what?" She asked before sitting back down on the couch.


"Alpha Carson wants to throw a party for our victory before everyone leaves." Kristen told her.

"That's all you. I'll show up but that's it." Penny sighed and curled up in a ball. noveldrama

"Ice, can you asked the doctor if we can leave since Elaina ate all she was suppose to?" "Of course." Kristen stood up and put the babies in the crib since Penny didn't move to take them.

As soon as she was gone, I looked at Penny. "You don't have to go." "I know but I need to. Like you still have responsibilities to the pack, so do I. I can't ask them to callAlpha and not act like one. I'm going to take stoff of my duties but I will still make spublic appearances for awhile. It looks like Elaina will be okay so now it's just getting back to a new normal." The door opened quickly. "I heard you are ready to spring loose?" The doctor said as he walked in.

"She ate her whole bottle and it would be nice for us to settle in." The doctor looked at Penny and nodded. “She needs bedrest and sleep. It will take stto rebuild her blood supply. Her wolf has already healed her from childbirth so I think maybe a week and she will feel back to normal but the more sleep, the better." "You won't get any fight from me." Penny yawned as she spoke.

He looked at me. "Any questions?" "No, Doc. Thanks." "You know where to findif you need anything. They need at least three diapers a day or not more. They should be eating every two to three hours. Here is a pamphlet on everything you need to know about babies." He placed sreading material in a small bag that was sitting by the door before walking out of the room.

"I'll get everything in the car. You can cmake your way when you are ready." Kristen had a huge smile on her face. She started cleaning as I looked at Penny.

"Go ahead and get into the car. I'll grab the babies and follow you out." "The carseats are at home." Penny looked around and realized we weren't prepared.

"It's fine. I'll hold them." "I'll drive you home!" Kristen said a little too excited.

"No...I will be driving. The goal is no more scary situations." Alec raised an eyebrow at Kristen, daring her to respond.

"Ass." She muttered as she carried a handful of stuff out of the room.

Standing up, I grabbed the boys and Penny led us out of the hosptial room. "Don't worry. Kristen isn't m cooking for you either. Your freezer is completely stocked with meals and there is a meal train set up for you." Alec muttered quietly before we walked out of the hospital. .

All I could do was smirk as we were in earshot of Ice. She had opened the door for Penny andbefore closing it behind us. However, she didn't get in.

"Not coming?" Penny asked, rolling down the window.

.

"Not yet. I'll be there shortly. I am and going to start on a few things and any things then head over Aled is staying with you and is very capable of changing a diaper." .

"Baby diapers only. I don't do adult ones." Alec said a little too aggressively. Penny and I both started laughing at this and Kristen just rolled her eyes.

"See you soon!" She said and started walking off.

"Alec, if you would rather work, that's okay." Penny said as he started driving.

.

"Are you serious? You have worked with Kris before. Do you honestlym think I will accomplish anything with her in the office?" He looked through the rear view mirror at Penny. .











###Chapter 0514

"Fair enough.” Penny gavea look and smirked. We both knew how Kristen was and found it funny it was his turn to deal with her. There wasn't any sympathy but we shared a look that said we might poke the bear a few times for our own personal entertainment.

I was surprised as we pulled up to our house. It was decorated in pink and blue streamers and there was a very large sign that said, welchome. "What's all this?" Penny asked.

"Sherry.” Alec muttered as he parked the car and got out. Opening my door first, he then moved to help Penny out. She didn't require assistance walking so he walked beside her.

Alec opened the front door for us and I was not as surprised to see a very large basssitting against the wall with a little changing station that had taken over the living room. It was almost like they just get it up with a fresh pot of coffee, snacks and even a blanket folded over the recliners.

"This was nice..." I said as Penny helpedset the babies down. noveldrama

"When did she do all this?" Penny asked Alec.

Alec looked at his watch and shrugged before closing the front door. "They must have just left. Jacob was here with her. He knew you didn't want her in your house without someone with her. He is working on building that trust up again so this was her trying to get brownie points." "Penny, why don't you go upstairs and shower or go to bed. You can take a nap and relax. I'll handle the babies for awhile till you get up." Penny immediately turned and headed towards the stairs. "You won't get an argument from me." We watched her go up the stairs and waited until the door shut before Alec brought up anything else. "The center is completely leveled now. They are finishing up the cleaning and then will be leveling all the other structures on the property." He moved to one of the recliners and sat down.

Since the babies were still sleeping, I took the coffee cup and the other recliner. "That is for the best. Do we know how many survivors there was?" "Not yet. A few dozen anyway. Most have track marks

and said they have very little memory from their life before. The doctor thinks they were given a drug to make them forget so they wouldn't resist as much." "Damn. We have a list of girls that were kidnapped and or missing. Hopefully they will be able to match them." Taking a sip of coffee, one of the babies instantly started fussing. Not wanting them to wake the others, I got up instantly and picked little Elijah up.

"Kristen wanted to schedule the party for in a few days. That way they will get out as soon as possible. However, we still needed their help with cleanup so it was a compromise." Alec watchedas he rocked in the chair.

First thing I did was check his diaper and he had a little blue line that I was 90% sure meant he was wet. Putting him on the changing table, I started to get him undressed. "I don't know to where even go from here. What do we even do with that land?" "No idea. We never did find a normalcy after Kristen was taken. Maybe we just need to focus on getting the pack's moral back up and then worry about it next year." As soon as I pulled the diaper off, I could see he was in fact wet. Pulling the diaper off and tossed it into trash that was sitting beside us. Grabbing a new diaper, I was about to put it under him when he started peeing. It went up and over his own head and on the floor. "SHIT!" I was both surprised and impressed with how far that went.

Alec started laughing at me. Wanting the pee to stop, I just put the diaper over his penis and waited. Elijah was crying because he got pee on his face, was naked and the goosebumps followed the shakes.

Grabbing a wet wipe, I tried to clean his face up but that just pissed him off more. He was so loud that Elaina and Cooper were now awake and crying. "Dude, you are doing a great job." Glaring at Alec, I was suddenly overwhelmed and amused at the stime. "How about you help me." "Fine." Alec got up and took Elaina.

"Why didn't you take Cooper?" I said as I finally got Elijah cleaned up and pulled out a new onsie.

.

"I'm used to girls and girls don't pee on your like that." Alec took a diaper and went to the couch. Out of them corner of my eye. I watched him expertly change her diaper and swaddle her back up by the tI got Elijah dressed. In my defense, he kept moving where Elaina was a perfect princess. .

Putting Elijah back in the bassinet, I took the last crying child and started changing him. This time, I had the new diaper ready. Putting it under the old one, I pulled the old one out and immediately covered his penis with the new one.

"Look at you learning!" Alec slapped my back and walked to the kitchen.

"Fuck off." I muttered under my breath but I made sure it was still loud enough for him to hear. By the chuckle I heard in the kitchen, I was successful.

Alec cback a few minutes later as I was finishing up swaddling Cooper. He walked into the livingroom with three bottles and three burp rags. "Sit down." He told me.

.

I wasn't sure how he wanted this to work so I just listened. He flipped the leg rest out and put this U shaped pillow around my stomach. My first impression of this pillow was how comfortable this was. My arms rested nicely on this and I could easily put a bowl of salsa on it. .

.

Alec cback with Elijah. He positioned him so he was laying flat in front of me. Then he grabbed m Gooper and did the same. He put a velco big around their necks and handedtheir bottles. As soon as he sat down with Elaina, his phone rang. .










###Chapter 0515

It was easier than expected to feed two babies than it was to change one of their diapers. Still, this was something I was going to have to get used to. "I am going to put ssupper in the oven. Kristen should be here soon and we will take off." Alec got up and put Elaina down in the bassinet.

"You guys can stay for supper." It didn't feel right to just kick them out.

"Afraid you can't handle the babies if Penny doesn't wake up?" Alec teased.

"You have one baby. I have three. You can stay the night and see how good you are then." I pushed back. Getting up, I put the boys back in the basssince I needed to pee.

"Excuse me. I have a baby and a Kristen." Grabbing the door, I couldn't help but laugh as I walked in. "Poor thing." I teased in a baby voice.

After peeing, I was washing my hands when I heard the front door open and close quietly. There was smuted whispering that I couldn't make out but when I cout, Kristen had put little Adalynn in the basswith the triplets and was walking to the kitchen. Alec was taking a deep breath. noveldrama

"What's up?" I asked. Looking over the bassinet, Adalynn looked so similar to the boys. Elaina got a little more of her mother but the boys were alland Adalyn looked like her mother.

"Just pack ." Alec wavedoff.

"We should get a DNA test done on them. Since we are identical twins, we share the sDNA. That means you are both the father to my kids and I am the mother to those triplets!" Kristen gavea look before retreating back to the kitchen.

"Is that how that works?" Alec asked quietly.

"I think it would be they would show up as more half siblings than anything but I guess technically yeah. Adalyn should genetically be considered the triplet's half siblings." I wasn't completely positive on that but I knew it was something along those lines.

"Whatever you say?" Alec rolled his eyes walked into the kitchen.

"Colt. Why don't you go lay down with Penny and We will watch the kids?" Ice offered.

I wasn't sure what to say. Walking into the kitchen, Alec was on a stool, looking at his phone and Ice was chopping sfruit. “I......” "After what you guys been through, you need squiet twith Penny. Letwatch the kids. We won't leave the house and if we need you I will cget you." She wasn't wrong. Everything inwanted to lay down next to Penny but I had kids now and my heart was torn. "Are you sure?" Kristen smiled at me. "Of course. Get going!" She took the knife and motioned forto leave with it. Smirking, I gave her a kiss on the forehead and headed up stairs.

By the tI got there, Penny was laying in bed asleep. As much as I just wanted to climb into bed, needed a shower first. The hot water fett amazing on my skin but I didn't linger. After getting out, I just put sshorts on and crawled into bed. Penny immediately turned and curled intoin her sleep. Wrapping my arms around her, I was asleep within seconds. wasn't sure how long I slept but I voke up because of two things. The irst was Penny was tracing my face with her finger and the second was ecause the babies were crying.


However, it was dark outside so we lept decently. Everything in my body ached. It had been so long ince I actually got a decent about o sleep. At this point, I was used to unning off fumes. Content belongs o english"Are you awake?" Penny whispered.

"No." I answered and tightened my hold on her.

Penny giggled but accepted being forced against my chest. She was unable to touch my face anymore. "I'm being suffocated!" She laughed.

"If you can laugh, you are fine." I grumbled. I wasn't ready to be awake but one of the kids let out a massive wail that made us both pause.

"We should probably get up." Penny sighed as I let her go.

"I'm sure Ice is fine." "ALEC!" Right on cue, Kristen's voice echoed up from the livingroom. Whatever Alec was doing or not doing was seriously stressing Kristen out.

"Alright, fine. Let's go." Not giving a shit that I was only wearing shorts, Penny went to the bathroom and I headed down. As soon as our door was opened, the smell of BBQ and something cheesy made my mouth water. "What are you doing?" Taken in the scene around me, Kristen was on the floor with three babies. She was trying to change them and Alec was just standing over her with an amused look on his face.

"I'm trying to change three diapers at once and two sets of clothes since Alec spilled formula on them!" Her hair was pointed in very direction like she was about to lose her shit.

"Ah, my little angle is the only one not crying?" I laughed as I picked her up and held her against me. She cooed and snuggled into my chest as Penny cdown.

"You boys are just going to stand around and watch her struggle." Penny said in a very disapproving way before sitting down and helping Kristen out. "I have BBQ meatballs and cheesy potatoes staying warm in the oven." Kristen said in a much more calm voice as her own belly growled. Penny looked up at Alec. "Alec, why don't you dish up four plates for us?" In a sweet voice that basically told us that he didn't have a choice. "I'd love to." Stomping out of the livingroom, he was clattering plates together as he did as he was asked to.

"I'm pretty sure it was an accident, Ice. No reason to bite his head off.”















###Chapter 0516

"It isn't the first time." She tried to justify it.

"It's not the first tyou are both a pain in the ass and a life safer." I said back and walked into the kitchen. Alec was standing at the stove, putting cheese potatoes on a plate. "There is an apron hanging in the pantry if you need it." "I'll put your food in a dog bowl." Alec pointed the spatula at me.

"So tense." Sitting down on a stool, Alec went to the fridge and pulled out two beers. noveldrama

Twisting off the lid to the first beer, Alec smirked at me. "It's fine, I'll get laid tonight and be okay." Fake gagging, he took it too far. "Gross." Taking the beer and getting a big swig.

"Two can play that game." Alec said as the girls walked in.

"Go lay her down so we can eat." Ice demanded.

"Still mad I see." Getting up, I wasn't going to push too hard. She did stay over and help with the babies and will be back. Laying Elaina down, she turned her head and rested her forehead against Adalynn. Those girls are going to be best friends.

"Who made this?" Penny asked. I had just caround the corner and saw her blow on the BBQ and before taking a bite.


"A pack member. I'm not sure who. We put out a memo about wanting freezer meals and so Penny could recover with the babies and not worry about food. There was many members that offered to cclean and help out, too." Kristen said and took a bite.

"We only put the memo out because speople asked what they could do when you cback." Alec asked.

Penny seemed really touched by this. "That is so sweet." Kristen looked at Penny. "You know you don't have to go to the party." "I know but I think I'll make an appearance. It would only be appropriate seeing

as they all chere to help me... help us." Penny sighed.

"If you are worried about not feeling up to it..." Kristen started.

"That's not it. My wolf has completely healed me.” "Seriously? I'm not even fully healed." Kristen looked shocked. "I have a powerful strong wolf!" "She is a pure alpha female.” Alec noted and took a swig of his beer.

"What is bothering you about it?" I asked. Taking the last bite, I took mine and Alec's plate to the sink. "Leaving the babies." "We have sgreat nannies that have offered to watch the babies. However, I figured you would feel that way so I have a room being made into a nursery for people to bring their children to. It will be in the pack house so we can have warriors posted to make sure the babies don't leave. The party will be outside under a tent since it will be a nice evening. I didn't do anything fancy, just a BBQ and music." "Perfect! Thank you." Penny was visibly more relaxed. "I can always go into our old room and sleep if I get too tired." "Or we can just leave." I said as I sat back down. She was done eating so I pulled her stool closer to me. She sat between my legs and I kept my hand on across her waist as I drank my beer. Just having the physical touch was helpingand my wolf.

"I think you should probably stay for awhile. They were your allies that cto help." Penny rested her hand on my leg.


"We will see how the night goes." It was all I could offer.

"As much as I love you all, I am ready to go to bed. Adalynn doesn't understand what night and day is." Kristen yawned.

"Difficult like her mother." Alec followed suit as he took the rest of the plates and went to the sink. He started loading it in the dishwasher. Penny jumped up and started putting the covers back on the food before putting it in the fridge.

"Kiss my ass." Kristen tried glaring at Alec but he just laughed at her. Pulling her into a hug, he faked being annoyed.

"Thank you both for everything you have done for Colt and for me." Penny smiled watching their exchange.

Of course. I'd do anything for amily." Kristen smiled back at Penny. "When you guys get around, come to the office in the morning. I have a nanny set up in your old room for the kids to be while we talk bout something." Kristen let go of Alec and they started walking to the door. Alec grabbing the car seat from the closet and Kristen picked her up. "Sounds good." I said and checked on my babies. They were sound asleep but I knew that wasn't going to last.

"Drive safe." Penny wrapped her arms around my stomach as they waved and walked out the front door.

"We have like an hour before they need to be fed again." Penny looked up at me.

"What do you want to do?" Looking down at her, she was looking atwith a tinkle in her eyes.

Let's go! Grabbing her arm ,I pulled her upstairs .We half ran up the stairs.Tossing her on her bed .I climbed on top of her .Pressing my lips firmly against her ,she was already trying to take my shorts off.My dick was painfully hard .As soon as my dick was freed I was just about to rip off shirt when the babies started crying .

"Seriously?" My body froze and their screams went from annoyed to extremely pissed in about five seconds. "Con. Let's get them fed and get back to it." Penny crawled out from underand tossed my shorts. "A day old and already cock blocking me." I groaned as I got dressed and followed Penny down the stairs. "They are worth it." Penny smiled atand headed towards the kitchen. Grabbing the fancy pillow, I got comfortable.









###Chapter 0517

"We are here!" Penny literally kicked down the office door and set down the one car seat she was carrying.

As much as she tried to ther hair and look decent, it remained frizzy and pointed in very direction. There was sbaby spit up on her dress that she didn't realize was there until we were already headed this way.

Everyone in the office looked at Penny and tried to hide their laugher. Alec got up and grabbed the car seat and followedout. "Rough morning?" "Do you know what is worse than not sleeping at all?" "What?" Looking back at him. His amusement was annoying. "Sleeping for two hours at a tand then waking up for an hour to do it all over again." Alec snorted as we got to my room. "Adalynn believes the middle of the night is play time." "Hello!" There was two middle aged women sitting on the couches. Ice really did rearrange this room. The living room was really spread out with bassinets and baby items. There was a large blanket on the floor that they could feed or change the kids.

"I wondered when you were going to get here!" The other woman said as she clapped her hands together and rushed over to see the babies. "We made it easy. The hats on the kids have their names on it. Once you get to know them." I said and watched as they took each kid out of their car seat and carried them to the bassinet.


"When did they eat last and what is their schedule?" She asked without turning around.

"They ate about thirty minutes ago and eat every two hours but we are trying to move that to every three hours so please try to accommodate that. They do better when it is longer between feedings. However, do what they demand. They all have excellent lungs." "Sounds good! Obviously, you can reach us here. We will not be leaving this room unless you ask us to bring them to you." She finally turned to look at me.

"Sounds good." I said before turning to leave. Just for safe measures, Alec had a guard standing at the door.

"Has the meeting started?" I asked when we were down the hall.

"Nope. Waiting on you guys." "Okay." There wasn't much to say as we cup to the office. Penny was sitting in my chair, half asleep as everyone was else was just gossiping. noveldrama


"Oh, sorry." Penny went to get up but I made it around in tto push her back down gently.

"You're good." Standing beside the chair, I just crossed my arms over my chest and looked around. "Who wants to go first?" "Alec has the stuff." Anthony leaned back on the couch. He seemed rather disinterested in the whole thing. Everyone was used to it by now that they just ignored his behavior.

"It looks like there was ten werewolf girls that were in the cages. We are waiting on DNA proof as for who they all are because all the missing girls were babies or toddlers when they were taken. There was a total of fifteen human males and twelve human girls that were saved. All were dropped off at their designated hotel with the money you provided them. So far, there wasn't any push back." "The only deaths were theirs. We had a few injuries but nothing terrible. Everyone will be healed within a week." Jace added.

Carson pulled out the map and laid i Out. Looking at Penny he went to explained what she was seeing. This is the entire area that is zoned ogether His finger traded the thick "These red X's are the buildings that we raided. The purple vas a train they built from where hey were developing the mutants and where they would ship them off oo. They did the development vhere the orange X is. The casino is he big blue outline. That is the vhole casino property." "This a huge chunk of land." Penny had leaned forward and was looking over it all. "Who owns it?" "It is registered under Midnight River Pack." Carson said as he locked eyes with Penny.

She was silent for awhile. Her eyes didn't leave Carson's as she processed it all. Finally, she looked over at me. "Does that mean.... all that... that's all... mine?" "That is exactly what it means. We will need to file for a change of nbut yes, you are the only heir and since you are the alpha, it is all yours." I clarified for her.

"That's so far away." Penny seemed unsure of what to say as she looked back down at the map.

"It is. There is neutral territory between our pack and that land. It's big enough to be it's own pack. Truly, the options are endless. You could do so much with it or just let it sit there for awhile also." Honestly, I wasn't even sure what to do with it. Part ofhoped that she knew what to do. "Is that all forest? What did you do with all those buildings? Wait! Do I own the casino?" "Honestly, I'm not sure. We were focused on finding you and not that part. Alec is still trying to find out who owns it. However, with that being said, I do believe that you are the owner of the casino." Carson leaned back off the desk and looked unsure.

"That would be so much extra incfor the pack. Penny said under her breath. "Not that we need it but it could fund my projects." "You can expand your projects." I said to her. She looked up at me, confused. "That land, we could build a research center, Summer camp for kids, maybe just more outreach programs for those in need. If it is out there, you can include humans who just need help. Maybe an adult education center or sorts." "Do I need to decide now?" Penny asked without looking at me.









###Chapter 0518

"No. We are going to start with the casino. Let's wait to make sure that we have ownership and address that. Then we can look at the land and decide. Everything has been flattened." I could feel the instant relief flood Penny.

"However, I would suggest flying over it to make sure there aren't any rogues or squatters." Lars pointed out.

Looking at Lars, he wasn't wrong. "That's not a bad idea." Carson slappedon the back. "Either way, I think you have it handled from here on out. Obviously, you can reach out to us if you need anything." "As much fun as this way, I am ready for that party and then to go home." Hank groaned as he stood up.

"Not that I want your life in danger again but thanks for the rush. Sometimes it gets boring sitting behind a desk." "Again, I can't thank you all enough for all you did for us. Keeping Colt sane probably wasn't the easiest thing." Penny looked up atand smiled.

"I wasn't too bad..." I knew I was a nightmare but I wasn't ever going to admit it.

"Shit." Alec rolled his eyes and everyone stood up. Apparently, the meeting was over.

"Just so everyone knows, we are having the party tomorrow. Make sure everyone is aware but that is when the D.J was available last minute." Ice finally contributed to the conversation.

"Sounds good." Jace said and followed Anthony out of the room.

"See you for supper!" Lars smiled at us and took off.

Soon, there was one the four of us in our office. "What now?" Penny asked.

"Colt has to do all the paperwork in filling out what happened and submit it. Declaring the war over and we are the victors. Then he has like two weeks worth of papers to sign." Walking around the desk, Kristen grabbed a stack of papers that were hidden behind a caband dropped them on the desk for effect.

"What happened to you handling things?" I groaned.

"I did! I answered phone calls and kept everything in a pile as it cthrough for you. Don't worry, I signed all the important things. This is all maintenance stuff. No need to thank me!" Ice slappedon the shoulder a few times before walking away laughing.

"Anything fun happen while we were... occupied?" Penny asked. She pushed the paperwork in front of the chair and got up. Motioning forto sit down, she walked over to the couch beside Kristen.

"Nothing really. There has been so many mates found from the different packs. There is a list of transfers in there, somewhere. A few even mated with the girls that were rescued." "Oh really?" Penny's eyes shot up.

I mean, it was good news but on the other hand, it wasn't a surprise. They were wolves and everyone has a mate out there... unless they died. Alec went to the chair and pulled up his laptop. "You can use Penny's computer." I said and nodded to her desk.

"I'm good. Everything I need is on here." He didn't even look up atas he started typing away.

Penny and Kristen's gossip drifted into the background. I was just happy to see Penny relaxing and not being so stressed out. Going through these papers, it was easy enough to glance through them and sign it before putting them into their own pile. A few times, Alec got up and walked into Penny's office to take a call before coming back down and continue to type away. "We got to go feed the babies." Penny's voice cutout of my bubble.

The girls stood and headed to the door. "Do you want us to meet you for supper or you can head down when you are done?" Alec turned and asked.

"We will just meet you down there. I have no idea how long this will take." Kristen sighed.

"Emmy has her baby up there right now." Penny said right as the door opened before Kristen had her hand on the knob.

"Oh, sorry!" Jacob and Jasper weren't expecting the girls to be right there. noveldrama

"It's okay!" They slipped around them and Jasper shut the door.

"How's it going?" Jacob sat down in the other recliner.

"Why didn't you do any of this?" My glare held very little real anger.

"Take over your position?" Jacob put a hand over his heart like that was a personal attack on him. "I would never!" "All action!" Jasper shrugged like he agreed with Jacob.

"What have you boys been up to?" Alec finally looked away from his computer and frowned at them.

"All the girls have been released from the hosptial. They have their own rooms and the DNA will be in tomorrow." Jacob put his arms behind his head, like he just did the best thing possible.

"Why are you boys so happy?" It was like they couldn't wipe the smile off their faces.

"We might have set a little something up." Jacob looked up at the ceiling. He paused like he wanted to guess.

"I don't really care what you did." Alec turned back to his computer.

"You should, it's for you too." Jasper leaned against the wall with his hip.

"We set up a little party at the club. It's for the warriors to have a drink and let loose. They deserve it after all this. You both are suppose to give a speech." Jasper smiled at me.

"Or at least one of you." Jacob said, instantly.

"Exactly how is this a surprise for us too?" Alec looked at him like he was stupid.

"There will be a babysitter for all the kids and it is finally a night out for all of us, Like old times!" Jacob looked more like a plead for snormalcy after everything than anything else.








###Chapter 0519

"How late are we staying?" Penny yelled from the closet. I was in the bathroom, fixing my hair. I was in bad need of a haircut but this shaggy look was in so maybe it wasn't so bad.

"Till you are ready to chome." I yelled back. All the babies were going to be watch here with four different nannies. Two of which watched them today. The house will be surrounded by warriors so I felt pretty safe.

However, both Penny and I felt weird about leaving them. They weren't even a few days old and we were going to leave them to go drink? Penny didn't want to go but I felt obligated to go. They set it up as a thank you to the warriors for their hard work and for putting their lives on the line for us. So, I felt it was only right that we went for at least one drink and that stupid speech Jacob is makingdo.

Penny had to makecshower. Elaina was laying on my chest and I had a movie on. We were both so comfortable that my obligation seemed less important. She wasn't happy about it anymore than I was.

"How do I look?" Penny stepped into the doorway. She was wearing a tight fitting black scrunchy looking dress. It had one sleeve and a slit to the upper high on the other side. Her hair was left loose in curls but she kept her makeup light.

"Damn." It was more involuntary than anything.

"Doesn't it not look good? I feel so weird in my own skin." "It doesn't look like you had three babies a few days ago!" Walking up to her, my wolf kept trying to take control. He wanted to rip that off of her and fuck her right then and there. "So sexy." Penny's cheeks turned pink as she tried to find the right words. "It's.... um...." Grabbing the nap of her neck, her face looked up atand I pressed my lips firmly against her. Pulling her tightly against me, I was suddenly ready to stay hfor another reason.

"I... oh..." Penny stammered as I moved down to her throat.


"HELLO?" Kristen's voice yelled from down stairs.

"Are you fucking serious? I muttered as I let Penny go. "WE HAVE A FUCKING DOOR BELL FOR A REASON!" I yelled at her.

She didn't answer but Penny laughed as she took the chance to run down stairs withoutholding her hostage again. After taking a moment to collect myself, I headed down too.

"Did I interrupt?" Ice batted her eyelashes at me.

"Fuck off." Rolling my eyes, I walked into the kitchen and grabbed a beer as another person opened my front door and let themselves in. "EMMY!" I heard Ice yell.

"You did not just have triplets?" Emmy's voice raised an octave.

"I know! Right!" I'm glad they were gushing over Penny. She did look amazing but I didn't want her to lose confidence. Her stomach had sstretch marks and there was just the littlest bit of loose skin. The fact she carried my babies in there make every single one sexy as hell. "Got another?" Alec asked as he came in.

Not saying a word, I opened the fridge and tossed him one. "This is where the men are?" Jacob cinto the kitchen. He was wearing the most ugly looking snake inspired brown and black shirt.


"The fuck is that?" Alec asked before I could.

"Something Sherry picked out." Jacob shrugged and grabbed his own damn beer. With that shirt, he was now our beer bitch.

"Party is here!" Jasper walked in, holding up swhiskey bottles.

"Does no one know how to us a door bell?" I asked the room.

"As soon as the nannies are here, we are good to go!" Jasper ignored me. Opening the bottle, he took a swig before passing it to Jacob. He took a drink and gave it to me. Needing the little extra energy to make it through the night without molesting my mate in front of people was going to be rough. Alec was the last one and took the longest swig. "They're here!" I heard Emmy shout. Her voice was hard to miss.

"We got a limo for everyone to ride in!" Jacob smiled.

"No." Alec and I said at the stime.

"What?" His face fell a little.

"Penny had three babies two days ago. We aren't staying until two in the morning." "Swith Kristen." Alec filled in.

Jacob and Jasper both rolled their eyes. "They just want to get laid now their mates aren't pregnant." Ignoring them, we walked into the living room to see the girls giving instruction to the nannies. We stood by and watched. As soon as they were done, the girls all headed out to the cars. "Ladies." I said to get their Alec was the only one in atte the room. "I am forbidding you to let anyone take this kids outside of this hunless I tell you otherwise. You will do everything in your power to protect them. They better here and live when I get back." My aura made them shudder but they all nodded. Alec turned to leave and I was right behind him when I stopped and looked back at them. All of them were looking at me, half scared and half confused. "Thank you for watching them." After one last look at my children, I walked out and shut the door. There was a warrior at the front door, one on each corner of the house and two in a car. Alec went to his car, the limo was pulling out and I got into mine.

"Don't you think that was a little much?" Penny askedas she took my hand.noveldrama

Starting the car with my left hand, I put it into drive but didn't move. "After what we just been through... no." I said and then pulled out of my driveway.












###﻿Chapter 0520

The club was shaking from the bass as we pulled up. I couldn't even remember the last time we were even here. It felt like it had been years. All the paperwork has been sent to the pack instead of the bar and we hired a general manager to over see day to day activities so there wasn't a reason for us to be there. Now that I was here, a little bit of excitement fueled me to smile... just a little.

Parking in my designated spot, Alec and Kristen were just barely ahead of us as I turned off the engine. Getting out, I was able to open Penny's door before Kristen jumped in.

"Aren't you so excited!"

"Thrilled." I responded. She gave me an eye roll and pulled Penny in front of us.

"If we get them drunk enough, they will be passed out in your office and we can relax," Alec muttered. By the glare we received, they heard him,

"I would never do such a thing." I said loudly but rolled my eyes at Alec. He chuckled and grabbed the front door for the girls.

"About time!" Jacob had two beers in his hands. Raising them above his head, he seemed already drunk but I knew better. Jacob was the life of the party, didn't matter if he was drunk or not.

"Double fisting already?" Kristen laughed at Jacob.noveldrama


"Naw, this is for Sherry. Come on." Waving up to follow him, he lead us through the crowd. Everyone here was a wolf. There was half of a dozen packs but this placed was filled.

Coming up to a table they had set up, we sat down. It was a high top but it was

directly in front of the dance floor. Almost like they set up a head table at the club. Pulling Penny's chair so she was between my legs, I had my body sideways with my back to the wall.

"Alphas.... lunas..." Multiple people came by and bowed in respect and kept going or got on the dance floor. I couldn't heard myself think but Penny was smiling.

"Colt!" Jasper walked up to us.

"Where's Emmy?" Kristen interrupted.

Jasper looked over at Kristen. "In the bathroom. She will be out in a second." Kristen nodded and he looked back over at me. "It's time for your speech."

"Go get'm!" Penny slapped my leg and laughed.

"You can come with me." I growled and picked her ass up. Moving her with me, we


walked up to the D.J. booth. After standing for a minute, the song ended and he handed up the microphone.

"ATTENTION!" Jacob yelled. The room quieted down.

Bringing the mic to my mouth, I had to quickly come up with something to say. "How about those warriors?" I yelled. Instantly, the room erupted in chaos. There was cheering, high fives and even some people whistling in response. Only when they calmed down, did I continue. "Being part of a pack means we look out for each other. When someone is having a hard time, we help them. When someone accomplished something, we celebrate. This time was different. This time, it wasn't just an attack because we were bigger. They didn't attack us because we have the most land or the biggest guns. No... they attacked us because who your luna is." I had to fight getting visibly emotional. "Penny's blood makes her the strongest wolf on this planet and they wanted to steal that from us. They wanted to take human life and create an arm. Everything they tried to do was something we don't stand for. I was given an option. Option one... mail Penny's blood to them and in return, they left us alone."

The room erupted in growls and cussing. "Fucking bullshit!"

"Coward!"

"Asshole!"

Raising my hand, they quieted down. "As you can see, I chose option two. I said fuck you and that I would be killing them." More cheers erupted. "The best part, I am being petty enough that I sent the hearts of Vin and Sir Joe back to the mafia as a reminder what happens when you fuck with me."

That wasn't common knowledge so there was some gasps, some cheers and most applauds. "When someone gauges a pack, their first thought is the alpha. You have a bitch ass alpha, people will attack you. Now, I have backed up everything I have threatened, however, I am a firm believer that an alpha is only as good as his warriors. Yeah, I beat Vin and Joe but I was only able to achieve that because of you. You guys allowed me to not only kill them, but save Penny. You saved my children. You saved the future of this pack. You saved humans from being experimented on. You saved. You. Tonight is about victory, yes. Victory is only plausible with warriors who work hard, who are dedicated and who value what it means to be part of a pack. Everyone here did their part. Regardless of how little or how big, we remember everyone. I am beyond proud to stand beside you. Not only as your alpha, but as your leader, and as your comrade. I'll stand by you on the battle field and anywhere else you need. Everyone here has made me proud. I can't thank you enough for helping me bring back our luna."

Looking down at Penny, I smiled at her. The cheers became a faded noise as I leaned down and kissed her. I could feel the embarrassment but she didn't turn me away. Only after a few seconds, I pulled away.

The D.J. went to take the microphone back but Penny stopped him. "Can I say something?"

"Of course." He said instantly and backed up.

"Good evening." Penny said with more confidence that I expected. This experience really showed her what she is capable of and what it means to be an alpha. She isn't forced to sit behind a desk but can still be a leader. "I have something short to say before I let all you get back to your fun evening." Penny said and paused.













###﻿Chapter 0521

Everyone instantly shut up and looked up at her. Stepping back, I just folded my arms over my chest and watched her. Speeches weren't her thing and the fact she was even doing this surprised the hell out of me.

"While I was being held hostage..." Penny paused and looked down like she was trying to find the right words. "I was terrified, yes but I wasn't terrified for myself. I knew you all would come for me. I was scared for your safety. I was scared for my children's safety but never my own. Knowing the warriors I had behind me... behind Colt left me knowing their time was limited. It was because of you all, that I was able to stay mentally able to do what I needed to do to survive. I had so much faith in you all, that I knew it was just a matter of time before I was rescued. So, thank you for saving me." Penny ended her speech and no one spoke.

You could hear a pin drop. She felt so confident in her speech but once she ended it and no one said anything, she became unsure. Looking back at me for help, I only took one step forward when the room erupted in cheers.

She was so startled that she almost dropped the microphone but the D.J was right there to catch it. "That was epic!" Jacob came around as we were exiting the booth. "Are you sure?" Penny asked as the music started bumping again.

"Oh yeah! You are a loved luna." Jacob put his arm around her shoulds and guided her to our seats,

I was both annoyed and amused to see him act that way towards her. He has always been a playful guy and it wasn't like he was hitting on her but making her feel like he sees her as a sister. Showing his love of her in a different way. He used to act like this towards Kristen but he was intimidated by Alec enough that he waits for Kristen to hug him first.

As we walked through the crowd, many warriors nodded at her in passing or even held out their hand to her. Every time this happened, she blushed a little more but her back stayed strong. She wasn't the scared, unsure luna anymore. She was strong and finding her voice. Penny's body had grown since finding the real power and strength of her wolf and people were noticing.

It made me sick that it took her life being in imminent danger to get her to realize her full potential but knowing she was finally got there, made me so proud of her.

They haven't even made it to the table when she was fully engulfed by warriors and their mates. Walking around, I made myself comfortable and just let her do her thing. She was feeling very happy in the moment and I didn't want to stop that. Just seeing her smile was all I needed.

"Here." Alec pushed over a whiskey on the rocks to me.

Picking it up, I took a small sip before putting it down, "Thanks."

"That was a great speech she gave." Kristen looked at me and smiled.

"I wasn't aware she was going to do that." Only glancing at them, I kept watching Penny for the most part.

Kristen reached over and put her hand on my arm. "Relax, Colt. She is in a room full of warriors. Nothing is going to happen to her here."

"Ice, why don't you go join her and then maybe I will."

Kristen made a face at me. "Oh really?"

"Yeah. Go dance or something. Let your hair down or whatever they say. Make her have fun." I wanted Penny to enjoy tonight.noveldrama

Kristen didn't need telling twice as she hoped down. Practically running to Penny, it didn't take long for all that group to start dancing. "Penny sure seems like she has embraced her wolf." Jace said behind me as he pulled Penny's chair away from mine. Giving us more space between us, he sat down as Lars sat beside Alec. Their mates were out there with everyone else.

"I knew she had it in her!" Lars raised his glass to me and then took a drink.

"How does it feel to know your luna... I'm sorry, your alpha mate is stronger than you?" Jace teased as he pushed my arm.

"Pretty good." I couldn't resist smiling and rolled my eyes.

"What's up? Why are you still so... moody?" Lars asked. "Everyone is dead. There isn't anyone else out there to come for her."

"Still trying to sink in. We thought it was over when we got Ice back. Then it started up again with Penny. I guess I'm just waiting for another shoe to drop."

"Some call that PTSD." Jace whispered.

"Shit, Colt just needs to catch up on his sleep and after a few weeks, he will be back to normal. You can't say that after everything, you wouldn't have your mate and children under lock and key if it was you." Alec came to my rescue.

"He's got you there!" Lars laughed at Jace's expression.

"True. She would probably be prohibited from leaving our room." Jace brought his drink up and downed it.

"Where is Carson, Hank, Aston and Anthony?" Alec asked.

Jace took out his phone and looked at it before putting it away. "Carson and Hank

are here. Aston was on his way, last I knew and I haven't heard from Anthony." "Do my ears burn or are you talking about me?" Aston asked as he pulled up another seat.

*Just wondering where you were." Lars moved a little so we were sitting comfortably. "That was a hell of a fight! I'm glad it's over but damn, I'd love to be involved in more action." Aston laughed and looked around.

"I hear you. Being with you guys and seeing action again... things were getting boring. You train to protect but when everything is smooth sailing..." Lars shook his head.












###﻿Chapter 0522

"I'm happy I could provide that for you." The sarcasm in my voice was clear but everyone just laughed.

"We defiantly need to get together more." Jace finished his drink and started looking around for a waitress. "Kristen wants to do that Halloween shit every year." Alec finished his drink too. "Con, Jace. Let's get another round." Alec and Jace got up and headed to the bar. "What's on the agenda now?" Lars shifted now the girls were coming to sit down. Scooting my chair, Penny climbed on my lap. "Emily thinks she twisted her ankle." "Really?" Lars shifted so he could see her ankle.

"I'm really not made to wear heels. Don't worry, it will be healed soon enough." She waved off Lars's concern and took a drink from his glass. 

"You should have seen her. She was doing moved that would make everyone blush." Ice laughed.

"It's nice to let loose. This club is amazing! How cwe've never visited?" Emily looked at Lars.

"Someone's in trouble!" Kathryn giggled. Aston shook his head but looked at Lars. It was filled with amusement and apologise.

"That's because car rides makes you sick so we didn't cup." Lars nicely reminded her.

"That's right. Car rides are really a bitch but after being here, we are defiantly going to cback more." "Here we go." Jace said as he sat down the drinks. After, he picked Echo up and sat down before placing her on his lap. Ice got up and let Alec sit down but she didn't sit down on his lap. Instead, she stood between his legs and took his drink.

"Is the bar staying up with the business?" Ice asked Jace and Alec.

"They are doing okay. You don't need to work tonight." Alec grumbled.

"Is it really work when you are having fun?" Ice looked back at him and challenged. Alec raised an eyebrow at her and took his drink back.

"Yes." "You guys are really the perfect couple. I wondered who would be able to keep up with Ice's personality." Jace laughed at their exchange.

"Really? He calls you Ice?" Alec looked slightly hurt.

The table busted up laughing and I couldn't help but to join in. "You don't let him call you Ice?" Echo asked.noveldrama

"Don't worry, Alec. None of us girls can call her Ice either." Kathryn leaned forward and tried to help Alec but it didn't help. Everyone else had tears in their eyes from laughing and Alec just shook his head.

"I didn't grow up with them!" Ice said in defense. She turned to face him and pulled his head down to hers. She whispered something in his ear that I don't think I wanted to know what she said.

In the end, he rolled his eyes but picked her up and forced her to sit down on his lap. "I got sbeers for the table!" Carson's voice interrupted, bring the attention Alec. However, I watched him visually relax from it. I had to hide my laugher. Draping my arm over Penny, I leaned forward and took a beer.

"Where have you been?" Aston asked.

"Molly thought it would be nice if we mingled." Carson said with a smile.

"Well..." Molly looked at Carson with an annoyed expression. "You can go into battle with zero fear but small talk makes you sweat?" She had her hands on her hips and was glaring at him.

In unison, Aston, Jace, Alec, Lars and himself all answered for him. “Yes.” "Every single one of you are alphas! How do you run a pack without small talk?" She turned her attention to us.

"Betas." I said for everyone. They all looked atand laughed.

"Jacob does have that personality." Jace tossed his head back and laughed.

"Jasper isn't that far behind." Ice added.

"Did you guys know that my beta found his mate from the women we rescued?" Lars added.

Everyone stopped laughing and looked at him. "Seriously?" Jace asked. We were all so shocked that we weren't sure what to say.

"Did we get the test results back yet?" Lars asked Alec.

"Nope. Still waiting on it. Should be the next day or so." "That's crazy. Where is she?" Ice looked around to see if she could see him.

"They stayed in. She needs stime. Which reminds me, did Sherry ever caround?" knew why he was asking. With Sherry's background compared to lers, she might have the samet lifficulties. Sok of I'd give him stoff and let them work hrough their stuff. Have her slowly cfamiliar with how you run hings." Penny answered before I could. >w"If you don't mind, I might call you later on if we need to." Emily looked hopeful at Penny.

"Of course! Anything you need, just letknow." Penny held out her hand to Emily. After a quick squeeze, they let go. "Let's get back out there, ladies! The night is still young for all this talk!" As the women slipped off into the dance floor, we kept talking. “Does she have any idea of who she is?” Jace asked.

"None. She does have a little accent though." Lars shook his head. "She doesn't even have a memory until she was in the cage. They had to given her something to erase it all." Lars finished off his beer.

"I was asking around and there aren't that many ranking females that have been missing. However, the anrate over seas is very high. Too bad we couldn't ask Joe if he was in the business of smuggling women." "I doubt it." I said but paused. "I don't know. When we had that meeting, he was about respect. It is disrespectful to steal someone's ranking daughter. He even offered Penny a soft hotel room to deliver in if she willingly gave up her blood. If there was a way around violence, he did it. Still, if they owed him money, he might have taken them as payment." "Now, you are assuming he was aware of what Vin was doing from the beginning. If we make that assumption, we have to think whoever took over for Joe will pick it back up." Lars continued.

"Naw, I don't buy it. I would put money on it that he wasn't aware until he cover." Alec seemed positive.






###﻿Chapter 0523

"This is all speculations. Let's just not go down that rabbit hole." Alec shook his head.

"What rabbit hole?" Ice asked as the girls cback to the table.

"How's your ankle?" Lars asked Emily.

"Scan't feels it!" Emily slurred her words.

"Wow." Lars shook his head but laughed at her.

“As much as I am having fun, I do think it's twe head out. There is another party tomorrow and I can't stay up too late both nights." Penny put her arm through mine.

Jace and Carson stood up too. "I think we will head out also. We aren't young enough to do this twice in a row!" Carson laughed. Molly and Carson waved goodbye before they walked away.

Penny pulledto my feet, being as she must be that ready to go. "Can we go to your office for a moment?" She askedin the mind-link.


Confused, I just looked at her while Jace said his goodbyes. "Sure, why?" She didn't answer put pulled me. "See you all tomorrow!" Penny waved.

"Later." I said as I followed her. "Jacob, make sure things don't get out of control. Penny and I are leaving." Mind-linking Jacob, I made eye contact with him.

"Will do." He nodded and responded before shutting the link. He was on the dance floor with Sherry and didn't want to coff. Penny was practically running up the stairs. "What is going on? Are you okay? Why are we headed up here?" She didn't answer but threw the door open and waited forto cin before slamming it shut and locking it. Standing with my arms out slightly, I was so confused on what she wanted. However, I didn't have to wait long.

Penny turned and looked at me. Reaching behind her, I wasn't sure what she was doing until I saw her dress fall at her feet. Standing beforein jus her bra and underwear with her heels still strapped, my brain finally realized what she wanted.

It only tooktwo steps to close the space between us. Grabbing her neck and wrapped my arm around her waist, I kissed her hard. Penny's body melted under my touch. Her desire for uninterrupted sexual twas running through my veins, I could hardly handle it.

Picking her up, I moved to the couch and laid her down. Before I could even do anything else, her hands already had my shirt unbuttoned and was working on my pants. Right when I went to unhook her bra, Penny flippedand we fell off the couch.

Landing on my back, Penny was straddling me. Every tI tried to touch her, she slapped my hands away. This was her show. As she sucked on my mark, I couldn't help the waves of pleasure that shot down my body. It was becoming increasingly hard to let her do her own thing. Her nails ranked down my sides, little strips of blood showed just how hard she was pushing.

Moving down my body, Penny pushed my pants down the rest of the way. Our eyes met as she wrapped her hand around my dick and started stroking it.

"Fuuuucckk." I groaned.

As soon as her lips touched me, my head fell back. Penny's tongue moved around my dick with so much desire that I had to focus on not cuming too early.

My eyes were closed so I wasn't aware of Penny moving. Since I was so focused on not blowing my load, I washt/prepared for her to sit down on my dick. My hands firmly gripped her hips as she started moving forward and backward. My eyes were finally able to open. Penny had her hands in her hair with her eyes closed as she moved to her own Rhythm. I let her do her thing for just a few more minutes before I couldn't handle it anymore.

t was my turn to flip her over and ept going. Penny opened her mouth o argue but I stopped her I stopped her with my wn kiss. It was my turn to have my >wn fun. Pinning her hands above er head, I moved down her body vith my tongue. Goosebumps lined ny track. ¡wAs much as she squirmed under me, I held firm. As soon as my tongue touched in the inside of her lips, she gave up her fight. Now, she was arching her hips into me, begging forto keep fucking her.

This was a side of her I haven't seen before. A dominate side that wanted to be in charge. Moving back up, I just looked in her eyes and gently pushed into her.

Penny's eyes rolled in the back of her head as I moved in and out before picking up my pace. Het orgasm hit andy couldn't hold it in anymore. As my orgasm hit, my fangs extended and I bit down into my mark. The bond between us strengthen. "Oh, Colt." Penny groaned as our breathing calmed down.

"Never did I think you would bringup here to seduce me." Resting my head on my hand, I looked into her eyes. Her face was still flushed but satisfied.

"Eh... you weren't doing it.' "We should probably head to the kids." My finger kept rubbing her cheek.

"Yeah, I just wanted salone twith you. It's like they know we are together and they start screaming!" Penny laughed. Climbing off of her, I held out my hands for her to grab. "I know. Cute little guys though." "Can we go out the back way so no one sees us?" Penny asked.

She was trying to put her dress back on. "Don't want people to see how I affect you?" I teased.

"I might be finding my new role but allowing them to know I just seduced my mate isn't part of that." Penny gavea look. noveldrama

"I could show them these new claw marks down my side." I threatened.











###Chapter 0524

By the twe got hlast night, the babies were all sleeping and just had ate. They were all in their own rooms, wrapped tightly in their swaddles and looked so peaceful.

It almost felt wrong to lay in bed and go to sleep for a few hours before they were up and at it again. Twice, we had gotten up and taken care of the kids before they refused to go to sleep again. It wasn't until we put all three babies in the scrib that they laid next together and went to sleep.

I was laying there in bed before the sun cup, listening to the quiet noises of house when a faint sound of tires on gravel got my attention. Still, I didn't think anything of it until I heard the front door open and close. At this point, all my eternal bells were going off.

As quietly as I could, I got up and crept down the hallway. Two people were quietly whispering when I reached the stairs. "I told you no!" Relief floodedwhen I recognized Ice's voice. Half annoyed, I went to the babies and gathered them to take them down stairs. With any luck, Penny would be able to sleep in.

Little Adalynn was cooing softly in the bassso I just deposited my three and went into the kitchen. "The fuck are you doing here?" I whispered.


Ice about jumped out of her skin as a quiet shriek escaped her lips. Her eyes were wide but as soon as she recognized me, she got annoyed. "The hell is wrong with you?" She has as she clutched her heart. noveldrama

"You sneak into my house and you want to ask what is wrong with me?" Emmy was quietly sitting in the corner with a cup of coffee. Her snickering brought my attention to her and that instantly took the smile off her face.

"Alec got the result and he is waiting for you in your office. I cto help with the babies till the nannies get here." She turned back around and started cracking eggs.

"A phone call or text would have been nice." I growled as I walked up the stairs. As quietly as I could, I walked into our bedroom, grabbed sjeans, socks and a t-shirt and walked out. Getting dressed in the babies room so I didn't wake Penny up with my belt buckle, I went back down stairs.

"Here." Ice held out a thermos. The coffee smelled amazing as I just nodded my head and walked out of the house. The black coffee started melting away the sleep but the need to get a better lock on the door kept growing.


The whole drive to the pack house was a blur so when I parked and stepped out of the vehicle, I was a little surprised to find I was here already. The place was crawling with pack members and guest getting ready for the big party tonight. Why Kirsten decided she needed to be at my house cooking eggs instead, was beyond me.

My office door was open and Alec was sitting at my desk on his laptop. "Keep your mate out of my house." I grumbled as I walked in.

Alec just raised an eyebrow atas I sat down on the couch. "Need sbreakfast?" Ignoring him, I just decided I might as well get to work. "Dipshit said you got results back?" "We have a list of who the girls are related to and we were able to match it. A few of these girls were part it of spacks that were wiped out and presumed dead. Those lands are just sitting there as far as I am aware. A few more have relatives from packs in Europe. Lastly, all the remaining girls don't have any relatives left." "What about the girls the packs were gone?" "They have relatives but they are distant and according to the records, left the original pack for their mate's pack. The other girls don't have any connection that we can find so far." "Or they lived off the grid or on the run." I added. If their family spent generations living a certain lifestyle, there wouldn't be any evidence of who they are.

"Possible but at least we know their names. They have been going by names they picked. We have to re-register them so they can pick their own names if they wanted or take back their birth names." Alec sighed.

"When are they doing that?" I asked as my stomach growled.

"A few of the other alphas wanted to be here for that. They are scheduled to be here within the hour and the girls will be here around the stime. Between yours and Penny's office, this area is big enough for everyone to do it here." "That's fine. We can open everything up." Standing up, I started rearranging a few things so people could all sit here comfortably. Pulling up sfolding chairs from the closet. I had just finished moving the baby items off to the side when the office door opened and people started piling in. "I was asked to bring you this." Jace walked up towith a plate of scrambled eggs, sausage with salsa and pepper on the top. "The kitchen said this is how you like it." Alec avoided my gaze as I took it. "Thanks." Taking it, I sat down in a chair and started eating.

"Why aren't you sitting behind your desk?" Lars ask as him and who I assumed his beta walked in There was a shy looking girl clutched to his hand. Her eyes were wide as they took a seat in the far corner, like she was trying to blend in. "This is Alec's show, I did my part." Shoveling a bit into my mouth, I just ignored him.

By the tI was done eating, the room was completely filled. "Is Antho-" Alec started to ask but then Anthony walked in.

"I'm here." He said and closed the door behind him. "Let's begin."












###Chapter 0525

"As the alphas know, we got all of your DNA results back. I'm not sure the best way to go about this so I am going to call the names you have been going by. I am going to ask that you walk up and stand in front of me. From there, I will tell you what I know." I watched as all the girls were visibly shaking. It occurred tothat it might have been helpful if the girls were here but I guess it was too late for that. A few of the girls were holding hand, like they had formed a friendship over the tthey were held captive. "Could Grace, Samantha, Vivian and Kenzie cforward?" I watched a four girls walked forward. Sweren't too much younger than us and swere more around our age. "Do you remember anything from your past?" I asked before Alec got started.

"No, we tired everything." The oldest girl shook her head. Tears filled her eyes but it was her shaking hands that wrapped around the other girl's shoulds that got my attention.


"I called you four because you have the sstory. Everyone needs to understand that when you beca ranking member, you are required to submit your DNA to the database for these reasons. So, when we took your blood, we were able to cross match it with those who have done the same. From that, we can figure out where you were from and match it with the missing persons report." He paused and waited until they all nodded that they understood. "The thing you all have in common is the fact that your DNA traced you back to packs that got attacked and are not active anymore. The four of you were presumed dead and everyone else in the pack were killed. However, you do have family that has been connected to you. I have not reached out to them as I felt like that was something you could do when the tis right or I could help you as well. These folders are yours and I have placed your chosen non front. With that being said, you are the remaining ranking members alive, making the pack yours. You have options as to what you want to do going forward. You can join one of our packs as a regular member or you can go back and claim your land. In those folders, there is a paper, you can either take back your birth nand claim the rights to the pack nand land or you can keep your chosen nand put the past behind you. You don't have to decide right now." By the end of the truth bomb, all the girls had their mouths wide open

and their gazes fixated on their folders. One by one, they each cforward, grabbed their file and sat back down in their seats.

The mood in the room was very tense. Sof the other girls had silent tears running down their faces. I sensed more fear than anything but their gazes at those four girls were nothing but sympathy.

"Can Hannah, Brittany, Nova, Tracy, Kelly, and Victoria cstand in front ofplease." All the girls moved in front of Alec and stood there. Swhere holding hands and sseem to just hold onto themselves. My eyes went over and realized Lars's beta and the girl hadn't moved. I wasn't sure which option was the worst in this situation.

"I have folders for each of you as well but your DNA traces you back to European decent There aret family members there. I have also added your missing posters that were spread around. All these are from when you were young girls, like three years old." A few of them opened their mouth to speak but shut it again. As they cforward, Alee stopped two of them from getting their folders. "I'm sorry?" One of the girls asked. I wasn't sure who was who. "You two cback with positive DNA matches. It shows you both are cousins. All that information is in there." "A-are the f-family tress in there?" The sgirl asked.

"If I was able to retrieve them, they are. I haven't been able to do that for everyone." Her face fell as she took her folder. Their girls looked at each other for a moment before going back to their seats. Ironically enough, they were sitting beside each other. noveldrama

"Everyone else can step forward." Alec shifted and pulled out the smallest of the folders. "Your results are a little different. The hits we got were from fifty to seventy-five years ago. Looking further into it, there isn't any missing posters. The. relatives you had show und died naukal dauses. Where we would see son or daughter take over, the alpha names switch. There aren't any records of your birth on any files. Where we can trace the others back to a certain pack or territory, it appears you were raised as rogues almost. I don't have any evidence to show if your parents too you and ran from something or didn't like the change of alpha so they went to leave. Basically, I don't have answers for you. All I can

tell you is who your grandparents were. There isn't any evidence of foul play or an declaration of war. We will keep looking but I don't even know what your birth nwas. I'm sorry I don't have any more information." They each took their folders and sat back down. Everyone was silent for awhile before I stood up to conclude this meeting. I wasn't sure what I wanted to say something to ease their minds.

"Do we have any options?" One of the girls asked, suddenly. How long do we have to decide what we want to do? "What I want you all to know is you are free." I started my speech.












###Chapter 0526

"No one got information they wanted but it's a start. You can chose to keep your chosen nor you can look into your past. Hell, you can do both. In this room, we are allies and all run our packs similar with sdifferences. If you wish to join one of our packs, you only have to walk up to them and ask. If you want to join a pack but still look into your past, you can do that. If you want to leave here and see where the world takes you, you can. However, I want you to understand there is a certain level of safety we provide. Not a single alpha in here will keep you from finding out your truth but please know, if you join a pack, you don't have any rights to being a ranking member. If you have any other questions, you are more than welcto sit down with us and ask them. We will always be available to you as you move forward with your life. You don't have to decide tonight but everyone but Alec and I will be leaving tomorrow. Everyone here is welcto stay here as long as you need to. I'm not going to be kicking you out but for safety reasons, I don't allow guest for an extended period of time. Obviously, your situation is a bit different so we can cross that bridge when it comes to it." A few of the girls seemed to take deep breaths and relax just a little. No one was crying anymore and a few of them looked like they accepted what it was.

After a few moments, the girl that looked to be the oldest stood up. "M-may we be excused to look over everything before the party tonight?" "Of course. You can find any of the staff and ask them to mind- linkif you need anything in the mean time, otherwise I should be in my office most of the day. See you all tonight." Quietly, all the girls stood up one by one. As if they didn't truly believethat they could go. At the end, only one girl was left and that was Lars's beta's mate.

"I guess we all know what I am going to ask..." She tried to give a light hearted laugh but it was almost filled with sadness. "We haven't marked each other. Are you sure this is what you want?" He looked at her a little confused.

"You just toldlast night that you didn't want to be part of a pack. I can't and I won't be leaving. This is my home. I'm happy to support you in finding out your past. We will use every resource available but I'm

not leaving." "I heard you. Between how I felt spending the night away from you and since it appears there isn't much of my family left, I might as well start building my future. I still want to know what happened to my family but I can't spend my future stuck on my past." I was really surprised to hear that from her. Not that I didn't disagree but most would need to find their families. "I'm happy to allow you to join my pack. We can have a private ceremony when we get home." Lars nodded down at his beta and his mate.

"I don't think there is anything else that needs to be discussed. Everyone is free to do what they would like to." Alec went back to his laptop and started working away.

"I'll see you all at lunch." Aston waved before heading out.

"Yeah, I got swork to do also." Carson followed him out. Anthony didn't even say anything as he jetted out of the office.

"The girls asked for shelp doing something we we will be back.” Jace said as he slapped Lars on the chest.

"I forgot about that..." Lars sighed but followed Jace. His beta and mate followed them out as well.


In the end, Alec and I were the only ones left. Seeing as Alec was on my desk, I moved to Penny's to work. There was still so many emails that I needed to shift through. Smany signatures that still needed signed. At this point, I felt like I might not ever get caught up. "I figured it out." Alec yelled a little too excited.

"Figured what out?" I asked, only half paying attention. noveldrama

"About the casino." That got my attention. Getting up, I moved over to Alec to see that he was talking about. "What does it say?" "The ownership was under the Midnight LLC but there is a board of trustees. All of these people are alive." Alec showedthe report he had finally able to get his hands on.

"Who are these men?" I didn't recognize any of their names.

"No idea. I think they are humans but we won't know until we have a board meeting. You will need to file for ownership transferal and then clean house if they are wolves. Assuming since Joe had a nice office, it wasn't the first the was there. Worst case, these are still his men." "This might be tricky. Penny will need to keep the title as long as this business in functional. The land could be changed easilylenough but this will get messy. She will need to decide once and for all what she wants to be." I was so happy to see Penny find her inner strength but she can't be a luna of one pack and an Alpha of another. "She has becpretty badass." Alec muttered, half listening to me.

"She really has accepted that part of her." Sitting down in an armchair, I wasn't sure how to approach this subject with her.

"I think she will handle it just find." Alec shrugged with little concern.

"Handle what?" The door opened and Kristen and Penny walked in with smiles on their faces.










###Chapter 0527

"We got the information back on the casino." I said as she sat down in the other seat. Kristen stood off to the side and just folded her arms over her chest.

"And?" Penny looked between us.

"The ownership is listed under Midnight LLC and there is a full board of trustees and everything. Now, since you hold the title still and the paperwork backs up you being the ownership of the Midnight LLC name, you are the ownership." Alec said, simply.

"What is the problem?" Penny didn't change her defensiveness that had build up.

"You have a choice. We can go in there and clean house. Take ownership and do all the legal work that it would take to take over the ownership. The people on the board are people that we have never heard of before so we don't know if it is all humans or wolves. We don't know if they are even Joe's men. Up until now, we have merged the Midnight pack with the Blue Fang pack. You have been known as the luna to the Blue Fang. If you keep this listed as Midnight LLC, then you would have to step into that role and not be known as luna of the Blue Fang pack.” I said as I took her hand.

"If I chose to keep being the alpha of the Midnight pack, I can't be luna of the Blue Fang?" Penny asked.

"What's the difference between now and then?" "The difference is you didn't have anything under your name. The land was split and isn't known as Midnight anymore. Now, there is a property and under the werewolf law, you can't hold two ranking positions. However, we can take over the casino and then work on merging it but you would need to decide which title you want to give up." Alec clarified.

"Okay, Let's work on changing the nand switching over so the Midnight nis gone." Penny said simply.

"A-are you sure? We wouldn't have to reject each other or anything. You will have to denounce your ties to the pack when we join them together." I was shocked she was being so calm about this but then again, I wasn't.

"I wasn't ever part of the Midnight pack and the only reason we got the titles was because of Cassie. Blue Fang is my home. Everything else has been eliminated and I assumed we would just do the sas we did before so I'm not sure what this is." "The difference is this is entirely your decision. The rest I highly encouraged you on how to move forward. There isn't a wrong or right way to do this." "I mean, I would like to just take it over and change the name. The incwould be amazing for our pack and help fund my programs. I know this means so much legal work and headache but is this not the best way to go about this?" "I think that is a great choice." I said wanting to reassure her.

"Sounds good. We will get the paperwork in order so we can start the process." Alec said simply.

"What are you girls here for anyways?" I asked, ready to change the subject.

"Cto see if you guys want to get lunch?” "Yeah, we can get lunch. That would be nice." Alec said as his fingers flew across the keyboard.

"Just in the kitchen?" I asked.

"Yeah, they are having a taco bar. It was simple and easy to do with all these people here and the fact they are getting ready for the BBQ tonight." "Sounds good to me." I said. The desire to put off signing all this paperwork by far was greater than my hunger.

"Yeah. Might as well take a break. This paperwork will take awhile to fill out." Alec slammed his laptop down and stood up.

"How are the kids?" I asked. There was even a little withdraw I felt from not seeing them.

"Sleeping. We just fed them and laid them down before we cdown here." Alec walked behind Kristen as she headed towards the door. Penny followed Alec and I brought up the rear. "How are they doing?" I asked as I shut the door.

"Really well. Their lives are eating, sleeping and pooping. Nothing much difference." Kristen sighed. "I can't wait till they are a little older so we can play with them." Penny laughed. "I agree but the snuggles are something else." The kitchen was over flooded as >eople were walking around, eating ›r just mingling. From what could ee, no one was sitting according to acks but mingled together as one. The head table was empty from all he alpha and lunas but I wasn't completely surprised. We went to the line that had formed and waited out turn. More than once hey offered to let us put but we leclined Instead, the four of us just stened to the chatter that was joing around. A few of the girls we escued were talking about wanting o find their families. The general feel of the room was complete delight and happiness. As I went through the bar, I was vaguely aware of what I was getting. Instead, I kept my attention the pack members around me.

A group of guys tried to hit on sgirls but got shut down hard. There was a group of guys wrestling in the corner of er of the room and a group of girls happily gossiping about something. It was like our lives had finally gotten the chance to go back to a normalcy. Friendships were formed and bonds were found. "Earth to Colt!" Kristen snapped her fingers in front of my face.

"What?" Taking a bite of rice, I tried to act like I was paying attention.

"What do you think?" She asked, knowing she caughtnot listening.

"I wasn't listening." I said, not wanting her to win.

"What do you think about having a ceremony for Penny? To signify her retiring her alpha title."noveldrama











###Chapter 0528

"Oh, if that is what you want, I'm all for it." Looking at Penny, she seemed conflicted.

"I'm not real sure. I'll think about it." Penny seemed like she wanted to say something but held her tongue. Kristen had opened her mouth to say something but Jace and Lars sat down beside us. “Our mates are trying to kill us.” Jace said.

"A bit tic, don't you think? You had to hang up three mason jar chandeliers.” Kristen rolled her eyes at them.

"It's like twenty feet high!" Lars shook his head. "You guys should go all out for just a BBQ." "I have a reputation to keep. Thank you very much." "I didn't say it was bad!" Jace looked hurt as the glare Kristen was giving them.

"Half of it was your mate's idea so unless you wantto tell them you hate it..." Kristen's threat trailed off.

"Why did we sit here?" Lars grumbled.

Kristen threw a chip at him. "Because you love me." My food was gone and I still had so much shit to do it wasn't funny. "As much as I am enjoying watching my sister take down two farce alphas, I have work to do." Standing up, I kissed Penny on the forehead and walked out.

As much as I have enjoyed having my old friends around, I'm ready for less people here. It felt like shit was still going on and it was almost suffocating. Leaving Penny was always hard but it did seem less stressful today.

Bypassing my office, I went to my babies instead. Opening the door, the nannies were in the middle of changing their diapers. "Alpha? What a pleasant surprise." "I just wanted to csee them and how things were going." Walking up, she just finished changing Elaina. Holding her up for me, I was able to take

her and cradle her in my arms. She looked up atand my heart just melted. There wasn't anything I wouldn't do for this girl. She had her mother's eyes, makingpowerless in them.

"She hasn't ate yet. Do you want to feed her?" I was torn. My desire to feed her and put off my paperwork was very strong but I clearly remembered the midnight and three A.M. feeding and that helped. "I need to get swork done." Handing her back, I walked over to my boys. They were cuddled together in the bassinet, sleeping very soundly. After giving them both a soft kiss on the forehead, I went to leave.

"Colt?" Penny opened the door before I got there and walked in.

"Hey." Damn, I got caught.

"What are you doing here?" She was smiling at me, like she knew she caught me.

"Just wanted to see the kids." "You have work to do." She gavea look and walked past me.

"I know, I'm going." "Have fun!" She yelled as I shut the door.

There was a part ofthat wished Alec was back in my office but when I opened the door was lafe brokenhearted. Sitting down in my office, I started the daunting task of signing my nand answering emails. Every tI thought it has been hours, I looked at the clock and it had only moved five minutes. After the fourth time, I decided that the clock was actually broken.

RING! "Thank you!" I muttered as I picked up my phone. "Alpha Colt." "Alpha Colt, I am calling on behalf of the hospital. You wanted a call when you could do squestioning?" It was a nurse but she was trying to discrete.

I had completely forgotten about Gunther and Kara. "I'll be right there." I said and hung up. Grabbing my cell, I dialed Alec. "Yeah?" "He's awake." Is all I said. He knew who I meant, there wasn't a reason

to elaborate.

"Meet you there." He said and hung up. I was already out of my office and down the hall.

I could hear a few people call out tobut I was focused and needed to get to the hospital There wasn't a reason to really question him about where Vin would be but he could answer squestions regarding who operates at the casino. Alec must have been right behindbecause as I opened the hosptial door, he walked in a second later.

"Alpha Colt, Alpha Alec..." The nurse nodded in respect. "This way." She turned and went down a random hallway.

"Where are we going?" I asked. This wasn't the way we went before.

"He was moved due to needing the extra space for everyone you saved." She said without looking back at us. Instead, she walked with a purpose down a few more hallways before stopping. "He is in there with Kara. The doctor is actually in there as well." "Thank you." I said and opened the door. Everyone stopped talking and looked to see who was coming in but the doctor kept going after realizing it was just me.

"... can coff later today. You can go htonight." "What's the verdict?" I asked the doctor.

"He is good to go. The swelling in his brain has gone and since he has woken up, he has passed all the needed testing. I'll take the cast off his leg when you are done here but then he can go home." "Where is home?" Gunther asked, looking at me.

The doctor took the opportunity and left the room. "That depends on your answers." I said using my alpha voice. Kara was holding his hand but put her head down and walked over to the couch.noveldrama

Gunther moved so he was sitting up straighter in bed. “Kara said it was over, Vin was dead?" Apparently, the nurses told them. "Yes. Vin and Joe are dead." Gunther nodded like he was trying to convince himself that he was safe. He looked over at Kara and back at me. “What are your questions?"









###Chapter 0529

"Do you know where they were making the mutant wolves?" "I didn't. I was only part of recruiting the women here. He would havego to human pubs or homeless shelter and find swith no families." He didn't even blink as he answered.

"Do you know anything about a casino?" "Oh yeah. Rip owned that and he used it to finance the whole thing. The idea was really Rip's and Darin just took it over when he was old enough. Vin was Darin's right hand threw it all so when they died, he tried taking it over. Except, he was pissing everyone off and not paying off people like Rip would. That's why he called in his uncle. Joe had been here weeks before I think you probably found out about it. Though, my tline might be off, head injury and all." "What did Vin want with Penny?" "He wanted what he felt like she owed him. Darin promised Vin a lot of things that he had no intention giving out. Vin didn't think you would find the casino because it was under the Midnight nand he wouldn't accept that a girl was an alpha. He blamed Penny for it all since it was her mother that had Penny first. All this would have been avoided if Penny wasn't around. Vin wanted everything Darin had.

"That was a lot of nothing." Alec said, behind me.

"I'm not sure what to tell you. There isn't sbig truth bomb. Vin was just trying to take everything Darin had built. He would had lost it all if it wasn't for Joe but I wasn't privy to any of that." "Is there anyone else that is still alive that would cback to try to kill Penny?" I asked.

"No. I'm the last person. Though, the warriors might still hold a grudge but I haven't talk to any of them." "What are your intentions?" Alec asked.


"I just want to live a quiet life with Kara. I'll join your pack." Gunther's eyes scrunched together.

"Penny is his alpha." Alec muttered in realization.

Shit, he was right. She was still his alpha. "She is what?" Gunther asked.

"Penny. She is technically still the alpha of the Midnight River pack." I clarified. "We joined the lands but we haven't officially gotten rid of the name." "Well, shit." Gunther looked shocked. "So, all the warriors that are under your command?" "I'm her mate, that makesable to command them to listen." Shrugging, it wasn't a big deal will now.

"However, we are joining everything and the Midnight River pack will be gone." "Probably for the best." Kara whispered as she looked at the ground. noveldrama

Alpha, I did as you asked. I went >ack under cover willingly. I let you our deaths. I $ ready to give ak life to help you so could be free my life to rom Vin. Now Vin is dead and I'm sking for my life back." Gunther ept his back straight but he was ware his future was in my hands. Still, he wasn't wrong. "People will not take kindly to seeing your face again." "I'm aware. I was hoping you would let them know what I sacrificed... what we sacrificed and hopefully they could find it in their hearts to forgive." "We could just leave the pack and never cback..." Kara said in a hopeful voice.

"No, Kara. This is your home. We have no money, no where to go. We literally the clothes on our backs. We need to at least stay for awhile or until we get back on our feet." Gunther looked at Kara with an expression I hoped to never see again.

"You will be under probation. You each will have a job that I assign you and you will put in the tto make it up to the pack. You betrayed everyone here, Kara. Gunther, you nack are literally the enemy. The crimes I said at the trial still resinate in their hearts. It will take tand effort on your part. Tonight, I will make an announcement. There is a BBQ for everyone before they leave tomorrow." "Where will we live?" Kara asked as silent tears ran down her face.

"You will stay in a room I assign in the packhouse." I wasn't sure I was making the right call but I did tell them they could have a fresh start if they went under cover for me. "I'll talk to Penny and we can have a meeting about it later to discuss further action." "What aboutjoining the pack?" Gunther took in what I said and accepted it all.

"At the end of your probation, we will decide on your future." I said, firmly.

"Why are you doing this, Colt? Why not just exile us and you will never see us again!" Kara was crying. The anger in her eyes didn't surprise me. She was going to have to face her family, her friends and her old life.

All the people she betrayed, it was coming back to bite her in the ass.

"KARA!" Gunther said, shocked. "You can't sa-" I held up my hand to stop him from talking. "Kara, running from your choices isn't going change anything. You had choices... both of you, You could have walked up to my office and toldwhat was going on and I would have helped you. Instead, you committed treason. Now you get to face the people you turned your back on. If you want my forgiveness, this is how you are going to do it. You don't have a choice. If you run, I'll hunt you down and bring you back kicking and screaming." "What happened to Zac?" Gunther asked after a short pause.

"He has been confined to his house with Cassie. I'll be allowing him to cout of house arrest tonight too." "Good." Gunther had something in his eyes that toldI wanted to be there when they cface to face.








###Chapter 0530

"You did what?" Penny was looking atlike I was crazy.

Currently, we were getting ready to walk downstairs to the BBQ. She had ran hearlier and got us clothes to wear tonight. Penny was wearing a fun, light blue cotton dress. It had buttons down the front and she had put on white sneakers. Leaving her hair down, she did a light layer of makeup and looked perfect as always.

She grabbeda pair of jeans and a simple white button up, athletic fit shirt. “What was I suppose to do. I told them if they went under cover, we would forgive them. It was the only way I could figure out how to get to Vin. Besides, they only want to be with each other." Penny was not taking the news about Kara and Gunther as well as I hoped. "I don't want them here. Why can't they just be exiled and be done with it?" "For starters, you are his alpha. You hold the title and he is still part of your pack. Second, the pack will give them a hard tbut eventually, they will forgive them. If I let them go, there would always be that regret in their hearts. They need this." "What about what I need?" Penny put her hands on her hips and looked atwith so much anger, it surprised me.

"Why are you so angry about this? I figured you wouldn't be happy but I didn't think you would be this angry." Finishing buttoning my shirt, I was ready to go.


Penny crossed her arms. "I just want to forget everything. I had to give birth in a hotel, watching you fight for our lives and..." Penny closed her eyes. "I don't want to remember and that is all I see when I see them." Walking up to her, I pulled her into my chest. She turned her head so her makeup wouldn't get on my shirt.

"I understand that was very traumatic for you. I didn't enjoy it either but I have to stand by my word. If a man doesn't have his word, how trustworthy is he?" There was a knock on the door that kept Penny from answering. Instead, she pulled away fromand walked over to the door. Afte collecting herself, she opened the door to Alec and Kristen.noveldrama

"Hey! Are you guys ready to head down?" Ice asked as she looked at Penny's dress. "That is too cute!" Kristen was wearing a maxi dress and a jean jacket with her hair in a pony tail. Alec was in jeans and a black button up. "Apparently, we are the last to head down." He said.

"Well, let's head down." Penny had on a smile and waited till Kristen and Alec went first. "After you." Kristen took Penny's arm. "We can walk together!" Alec just shook his head and ollowed the girls. Coming in last, it vas my responsibility to shut the e loonThe loor The babies Je woping and he nannies were just hanging out, vaiting for us to leave. With two juards at the door, I was getting nore and more comfortable leaving hem for short periods at a time. As soon as we made it downstairs, the sun was starting to set. Soft lighting had turned on, music was playing and the smell of BBQ made my stomach growl. "This turned out good." "Thank you!" Kristen guided us over to one of the head tables. She had placed multiple tables for each Alpha to sit up front. "Colt, they are ready for your speech and then we can eat and mingle." Carson said as he walked up to me.

"Kara, are you in position?" I mind-linked her as I walked up to the podium.

"Y-yes." She said. Her voice made it sound like she might cry at any moment. "Good. Be ready." I said, firmly and walked up. "Hello!" I said in the microphone.

The tent was large enough that it wasn't a bad idea to have a microphone. Within seconds, the noise quieted down and the music turned off. Kara and Gunther were in a little tent off to the side. I had asked people to put up Do Not Disturb signs so they wouldn't be seen before I was ready for them to.

"Thank you all for coming tonight! There has been so many emotions lately and with all the ups and downs, a little relaxing was defiantly needed. I have one announcement I need to make before we continue to enjoy tonights festivities." Looking back at Penny, she had her arms folded and wasn't happen. Kristen and Alec had picked up on her emotions. Alec knew what was going to happen but apparently, he hadn't told Kristen because she looked confused.

"Not that I need to explain my reasonings to anyone but I feel like everyone here deserves an explanation." I paused trying to find the right words. "Many times, when people are in danger, you have to use the tools that are in front of you. When an opportunity presents itself, you have to take it by the horns and not look back. That is what I did. I saw an opportunity at a point in this war that could have broken the case wide open. If you are from my pack, you will remember when we held a trial for Kara, Gunther and Zac for treason. They were found guilty and sentenced to death. What you don't know... is I faked their death.” A loud gasp ran across the tent. "WHAT?" A few people yelled out.

"I made a deal with them. I would fake their deaths and toss their bodies at Vin's feet. My hope was that Vin would believe I failed aback.

killing them and take them This plan worked. They were invited back at Vin's private mansion. I have put trackers on them so we followed them there. I can go into details but the bottom line is they put their lives on the line so I could gather information."










###Chapter 0531

No one spoke for a moment so I kept going. "Their lives were over regardless. I gave them an option. Either I could kill them now or they could earn their lives back. They chose to earn their lives back and go under cover. Their sacrificed helped us gather information and ultimately eliminate Vin. There was a point that they were caught and Gunther was beaten almost to death. He made it through, however." "Con out." I mind-linked Kara.

Kara and Gunther slowly cout from the tent. Once people saw them, they gasped and instantly got angry. "Traitor!" "Loser!" "Should have died!" Holding up my hand, Kara and Gunther walked up behind me. They were holding hands but Kara had her head lowered in shame. Part offelt bad for them but not all of me.

"Since they completely their assignment, they can start to earn their lives back. They will hold jobs and start working on earning your trust back.... and mine. I offered the deal and now I need to be a man of my word and see to it that they try to get their lives back. I know this decision isn't a popular one but it is morally correct. They understand that earning back your trust and forgiveness will be very difficult but that is their purpose for even being here. I will not tolerate unjust hazing. My pack will still hold their heads high and not stoop that low.” "A-alpha? C-can I s-say something?" Kara's voice stoppedfrom speaking.

Deciding she had nothing to lose, I handed her the microphone and stepped back. "I'm sorry." Kara couldn't stop the tears that ran down her face. "After Colt... I mean, after Alpha Colt found Alpha Penny, I was hurt. However, I found my mate. Gunther is my mate. He hasn't made great choices but he was working against the only family he knew to save not onlybut Alpha Penny as well. I accept the fact that my actions were wrong. I did them out of love for my mate. I wanted to help him get free." She had to wipe her tears on her shirt. "I grew up with all of you. You know what kind of person I am, which made my betrayal that much worse but I am begging you find it in your hearts to understand why I did it and hopefully to forgive me." Kara turned and handed the microphone back to me. Gunther accepted Kara

in his arms. Looking around, the packs were torn. Shad a sympathetic look on and swere still filled with rage. I wasn't even sure how I felt. Maybe indifferent? I guess you have to have respect for something for them to disappoint you.


"I'm not asked for you to forgive them. I'm asked you to stick to the values we hold dear to our hearts. Anyone with questions or concerns can speak toprivately." I paused before looking at Kara and Gunther and nodding. They walked off the podium and sat down at an empty table.

"This party is to celebrate our packs coming together. Mate bonds were formed, friendships grew and our families expanded. Remember why we are here. Remember that sense of community that a pack provides. Cherish everyone you love. Lastly, have fun and dance your tails off!" The crowd cheered as the music turned back on. Handing the microphone back, I went over to Penny, Kristen and Alec. "Why didn't you tell me?" Kristen looked like I betrayed her.

Not wanting to toss Alec under the buss, I just took it. "I'm sorry but this was a spare of the moment thing. He had been in a coma and I've been a little more worried about my triplets." That seemed to do the trick as she turned and walked off. Penny followed and they headed to get food. "Thanks." "You owe me." I said to Alec with a smirk. noveldrama

"Whatever." Alec just rolled his eyes and looked on. "Do you really think they will be forgiven?" "Nope but nothing like facing the consequences of your own actions." "Death was too simple." Alec stated. It wasn't a question but a statement.

I saw Lars and Jace walk up to me. "Someone likes ." Jace said.


"I like being fair." "Your dad would have been proud." I heard Carson's voice from behind me.

"Thanks." I said, shaking his head. "I have seen all the alphas except Anthony." "I saw him a little bit ago? Why?" Carson looked around, like he was trying to remember when he saw him last and scanned the crowd.

"No reason. Just wanted to know if he showed. He's been acting weird." "He is always weird." Jace muttered. “I have seriously though about cutting ties with him.” "So, has anyone had anyone ask to join their packs?" Lars changed the subject. "I've had a few, however, I think it was because of my beta's mate." "They probably felt more comfortable that way." Jace said.

“Let's go get sfood." Carson said. His eyes have been watching the line and it finally seemed to get shorter.

"Sounds good!" Jace didn't need telling twice as he took off. Penny and Kristen were making their way back to our table. Chapter 0531 1 "I did. It all looked so good." "The fried okra looks the best." Penny laughed as she popped one in her mouth.

"It's better with ranch." Kristen teased Penny.

Chapter 0531 2 Chapter 0531 3 "What?" I asked, suddenly in a better mood.

"Where did you go?" She asked.

"Just trying to decide what tattoo I want to get." I gave Ice a genuine smile. Yeah, everything was back to normal.

###Chapter 0533

Kristen POV Huge white snowflakes fell out of the dark sky and onto the grass below. These last six months have been as peaceful as it is when you watch the snow cover the trees. There hasn't been any threat on our lives and my shop was growing larger than I ever expected.

Currently, Alec was giving Adalynn a bath so I had a few moments to myself. Colt and Penny were going to cover for dinner. Wanting to relax a little, I grabbed the bottle of Jack and poured myself a glass. Now, I was standing by the balcony windows, watching the white bullshit collect on my precious grass.

"All done, mommy!" Alec cup behindwith our daughter. She looked just likebut had her dad's piercing green eyes. Adalynn was such a daddy's girl that if he was in the room, she didn't want me. Though, nothing melts your heart faster than watching your mate bond with your children.

"You look so pretty!" I said with a big smile. She was all dressed in a zip up onesie, ready for bed. "I got a bottle for you!" Holding the bottle out, she reached out and grabbed it, greedily.

“She has a little tooth coming through." Alec said as he tried to help her put the bottle in her mouth. Her eyes instantly rolled back and closed so Alec cradled her in his arms.

"She isn't acting like it hurts her." I said watching them.

The door bell rang, interruptingtrying to get a look. "Can you get that? It's probably Vivian." Vivian was our personal nanny. Since I was a little jealous of Colt getting our mother's house, Alec builtone. We have only be in it for a little over a week now but I loved it. noveldrama

It was like a ranch style meets barndominium. When you walk in, the foyer was large with an office on one side and a closet on the other. When you kept walking, it opened up to a massive room that included the livingroom, kitchen and informal dinningroom. Stairs were off to the side that lead to a loft. The balcony looked over the entire room but only a bathroom and closet was up there. Stairs went

down into a man's cave area. Complete with a groom and bedrooms. The master bedroom was on the other side of the livingroom. We had a huge walk in closet and bathroom. There was two other bedrooms on the main floor, each had their own bathrooms. With a three car garage, you can either enter the house through the pantry or through the mudroom, depends on your needs. All the trim was treated dark stained oak. The flooring was grey with brown hues but a matted finish so whatever the kids did to it was going to be well hidden. The walls were either a gray, sage or a shade of blues. It was my safe place.

The wall to vaulted ceiling windows made great views when I was stuck inside. Although, I hated the snow, it was very pretty to watch. Alec had lit a fire and we turned the lights down low for a romantic quiet evening.

"Hey!" It was Vivian at the door. Since Colt requested a dinner, I decided to have Vivian chang out with Adalynn since it wasn't quite her bedtyet and I wasn't sure what Colt was going to tell us.

"It's getting wet out there! The snow is really accumulating!" Ugh! Don't say that! I joked as she ook off her boots and hung up her coat. "I think Alec took Adalynn up tc he loft." Currently, the loft was Adalynn's play room. It wasrap the triplets and her up there vith the baby gates I had installed. The T.V. was wall mounted and the cords ran behind the walls so there vas nothing up there to hurt them. The bathroom and closet were ocked shut so I was confident in hem being safe. Not to mention an adult is always with them. Content elongs to english"Perfect!" Vivian was getting up there in age but didn't have any grandkids of her own. Her own kids hadn't found their mates yet so she was getting her fixes with Adalynn and the triplets. How she managed to care for four babies at once... I have no idea.

Following Vivian, she walked up the stairs and I went to the kitchen to get the food out. They should be e here any minute so I ready. Using one of Wanted to be mother's recipes, I made a roasted salmon with steamed broccoli. The salmon was about done so I put the salad out on the table. "Need any help?" Alec's voice startled me. The fork I was putting down went flying across the table.

"Shit!" Alec chuckled at my distress.

"So jumpy." Picking up the fork, he tossed it back across the table and looked around.

"I was thinking." Giving him a glare, he just shook his head and smiled.

"What do you think Penny and Colt want to tell us?" Alec asked as he walked over to the refrigerator and grabbed a beer.

"Who knows. Maybe he finally decided to stop arguing withet about the Winter Ball." I was still bitter. Ever since the whole fiasco wanted with win and Joe, Colt hasco to have a party of any sorts. However, I put my foot down and said we are doing this. The other alphas wanted to get together more and there are so many more teens that are over eighteen. These parties help find their mates. "Never thought I would see the day that Kristen Anderson would want to put a dress on." Alec was leaning against the island. He was smirking as his brought up the beer can to his lips.

"Kiss my ass." Tossing the spoon I had in my hand, he easily dodged it. Which just annoyedmore.









###Chapter 0534

"Do we need to revisit last night?" Alec asked quietly.

My body froze. Last night, Alec wanted to see how much I would submit to him. In the end, I absolutely refused to submit but I teased him so bad that he man handled me. It was honestly the most amazing night of sex we have had in months.

"You can try Mr. Alpha." I said sweetly as I walked up to him. Alec didn't move a muscle other than his eyebrow raising. Licking my lips, I got to my tippy toes and whispered in his ear. "I don't think you know how to makesubmit." My tongue grazed his ear as a low growl rumbled his chest. noveldrama

Alec set his beer down and his hands firmly grabbed my hips. "I don't?" He asked in an amused voice. His hand moved under my shirt as he lowered his head. His teeth gently bit on a sensitive spot I had on the back of my neck, along my hair line. It was just behind my ear but damn if it didn't make my knees give out.

Instantly, my breathing got heavy. Bringing up my leg, I wrapped it around his and pulled him leg forward so it was firmly pressed between my legs. "You can try but I-" The door bell rang, telling us Colt and Penny were here.

"Fuck." Alec groaned as he pushedoff of him. He had to adjust himself as I laughed the whole way to open the door.

"This looks amazing!" Penny said as they let themselves in.

"Cin! I said with a smile. "Closet is right there for your coats. No babies?" "Nope. We left them at hwith a nanny." Penny looked half relieved.

"Needing sadult time?" Colt took Penny's coat and sighed. "You have no idea. Where's Alec?" "In the kitchen. Con, food is done!" Alec had downed his beer and was pulling out two when we walked into

the room. "How was the roads?" He asked as he handed Colt a beer.

"Not too bad. The snow is pretty wet so it's just melting on the roads." "Do you care if I snoop?" Penny asked. I didn't realized she wasn't with us.

"Of course!" I said. I probably should give her a tour but the oven bell rang out forto get the salmon out.

"What did you cook?" Colt took a seat on a bar stool.

"Salmon and broccoli." I said as I hit the microwave for the broccoli. "It's from the cookbook and I wanted to try it." "Sounds good to me!" Colt looked a little worn down but nothing crazy.

"What's wrong?" I asked as I studied him.

"We had a rogue attack the other day." Colt took a chug as I pulled the salmon out.


"Everything okay?" I asked, my stomach dropped.

"Yeah. We are find but they got into the cells." Colt looked at me, like he was unsure how I was going to take the news. "...and?" I looked between Colt and Alec. Alec had his arms crossed and was staring at me, trying to gage my reaction. "You are telling her now?" Penny's voice cup the stairs before her head popped up. She had just been down stairs when we started talking.

"Might as well." Colt sighed and sat up straight.

"Tellwhat?" "The rogues were able to get into a couple cells and a few people died. One of them was Ann." The news shockedso much that I stopped everything and looked at him. "Ann is dead?" I couldn't believe it. "Are you sure?" "She was unrecognizable but it was her. She was in her cell and is the sheight and weight." Colt shrugged but didn't take his eyes off of me.

"Why are you acting like I am going to loose my shit?" "I just wasn't sure how you were going to react." "What did you do with the body?" Slowly, my hands started moving again as I dished up the salmon. The microwave dinged, tellingthe broccoli was done.

"We burned it. I didn't think of seeing if you wanted to cover for it, I'm sorry." Colt didn't have an expression on his face but his eyes toldhe felt like shit.

t's not that I would want to pay my ast respects but the hatred I felt owards her ran to my core.

Watching her burn would have been plifting to all the pain I went hrough. "Oh." WPenny leaned forward after a moment, "Kris?"Plastering on a smile, I was done talking about it. "Supper's ready! Let's eat before it get's cold." Grabbing two plates, I walked around to put them on the table. No one moved as I cback for seconds. "Serious. Go to the table.” Giving them a look, they att grudgingly went to the table. "If you feel like you need to visit her..." Penny started.

Looking at Colt, I pleaded with him through our twin connection to get him to change the subject. "How has Adalynn been sleeping lately?" He asked.

Relaxing a little, I stabbed the broccoli and ate it. Looking up at the balcony, I couldn't see a thing. Alec's and Colt's voice trailed off as flashbacks of Ann hit me. If Colt said she was dead, then she was dead but just wanted to have seen for myself. I always assumed there would be a trial that I would vent all my frustration out. I've been holding onto this hatred for so long that maybe now I could let it go. "Ice?" Colt's voice broughtback.

"I'm sorry, what did you say?" "The salmon is really good. The buttery garlic goes really great with it." I watched him take a bit and eat it.

"Thanks. I'm glad it turned out good." "So, Kris and Alec. There is something else we wanted to tell you guys!" Penny looked really happy as she reached her hand out and took Colt's.









###Chapter 0535

Alec and I glanced at each other before looking back at them. "Well?" I asked, the silence was killing me.

"We decided to open a girls camp with that land!" Penny's voice raised a few octaves.

That wasn't what I was expecting but that was still a good idea. "A girls' camp?" Alec asked.

"I haven't worked out all the details but we decided to use it to help the youth. We might add straining camps for future warriors but yeah!" Penny was looking around, wanting a big reaction.

"That's awesome!" I said, snapping out of my funk. Colt was looking atbut I tried as best as I could to fake being happy. It wasn't that I was unhappy, I hadn't even thought about that land for months. I was still stuck on Ann dying. “I think that is a great use for the land. What other options did you guys think of?" Alec asked. His hand reached over and gripped my thigh.

"Golf course for the casino. Which, we finally got the paperwork finalized. The casino is officially under the Blue Fang pack name!” "Oh, wow! That's exciting!" A genuine smile cto my face.

"I know. We will have to clean house and go through it all. I'll need help with the books and everything." Penny looked at me, pleading withto agree.

"Of course! Whatever you need." Everyone had finished their meals at this point. Wanting to put sdistance between myself and them, I got up and started clearing the dishes. They were talking about the possiblities the casino offered. Pulling out the cheesecake, I cut three slices and put them in front of them.


"That would be ideal!" Penny smiled and dug into her desert.

"Not eating, Ice?" "Not feeling like cheesecake." Standing up, I went over to the alcohol cabinet, poured myself a jack and went back to the table.

"I meant to ask, did you have a dress for the Winter ball?" Penny asked me.

"I actually don't. I need to go find one." "Good. Can we go tomorrow? I have an opening and was hoping you could help me." "I don't think I have anything impressing I have to do." I said as I took a sip.

"I think we better head out." Colt said as he took the empty cheesecake dishes and put them in the kitchen.

Penny's phone started ringing. "Oh, shoot. I need to take this." She said and walked away as she answered the phone.

"Con, Ice." Colt walked around the island and stood beside me.

"What?" I was washing the dishes and he put his hand on top of mine.


"What's up?" Alec sat on a bar stool in front of me. Colt pulled my hands off the dishes and turned my body to face him. "Tellthe truth. Are you mad I didn't let you csee Ann?" "I'm not mad." I tried to turn back to the sink but Colt didn't let me. "If you wanted to dance, we can at the ball. I have dishes to do." "Ice, don't do that." "Colt! Are you ready?" Penny walked around but paused when she realized she interrupted something. "liiis everything okay?" "Yes. Everything is perfect." I said as I was able to slip out of Colt's grasp. "I need to check on Adalynn. Thank you both for coming." Smiling, I darted out of the room and up the loft.

"She's sleeping." Vivian was reading a book as I walked up. noveldrama

"Thank you! I'll put her to bed." "Sounds good. I'll see you tomorrow!" Waving at Vivan, she walked down the loft and out the front door.

Adalynn was sleeping so peacefully hat I hated to move her but she needed to sleep in her crib. As gent I.ne is I could, I picked her up and started walking down the stairs. Ale vas standing at the bottom,

waiting or me. w"Is she sleeping?" He asked.

Reaching the bottom, he looked at her and smiled. "Sound asleep." Alec went to finish the dishes as I laid her down. She was so precious that it physically hurt to not hold her. Sighing, I decided I couldn't stand here forever and walked out, closing the door behind me.

Alec had a towel slung over his shoulder as he was loading the dishwasher. "That's a good look on you." I whispered as I took my recently filled drink and sat down on a bar stool.

"I aim to please." Alec lifted an eyebrow atbut kept working.

"That was great news about the casino and the land. I've been wondering what they were going to do with it." "Csit by the fire with me." Alec said as he wiped the counter top down and picked up his own drink.

We had bought an oversized recliner, big enough for us to sit together. It was positioned in it's own area off to the side. The fireplace was beside it and it wolfacing a massive window. Since the snow was still falling, it was an incredible sight. Alec sat down and opened his arm forto crawl in next to him. Not wanting to hold my drink, I just shot it all down and set it on the floor. "I've always enjoyed the snow." Alec muttered as I stopped fidgeting.

"I always hated the snow." I responded.

"How long do you want to sit here before you tellwhat you are feeling. I can't even figure it out." Alec put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. "Talk to me." His thumb traced my cheek and his eyes beggedto open up. "I don't honestly know what I am feeling." Sighing, if he was going to forceto talk, I wanted to be able to look at him. Leaning away, I draped my legs over him but put my back against the arm rest. He twisted his body so we were looking partly at each other and partly at the window. The fireplace was giving off warmth but show, I still felt like I needed a blanket. "Try."









###Chapter 0536

"I'm not... sad she is dead. It's like I wanted to see her body. See for myself she was dead. I wanted to watch her body burn for all the pain she causedand my family. I guess I feel almost robbed I wasn't there to see it. There is still so much hatred...." I wasn't sure what I wanted.

"That's reasonable." Alec nodded. His hand rested on my thigh.

"I should put a thorn tree on top of her ashes." "Is that it? Is something else bothering you?" Alec asked.

"I just.... that pack has been attacked by rogues so many times. Never once did they find the cells." I looked at him and tried to get him to understand what I was saying. "Have you ever heard of a rogue going into the cells?" "No." Alec took a deep breath and sighed. "If they weren't rabid enough, I could see it I guess but usually they do just cfor the warriors." "I don't know. I just don't like the whole thing." Looking out the window, I felt Alec's hand snake it's way up my thigh.

"Nothing is going to happen. She was literally the last person alive. Everyone is dead. Let's just focus on this." Rubbing on a sensitive spot on my inner thigh, I started feeling my body respond.

Being as stubborn as I was, I tried to act like it wasn't getting to me. "That does nothing for me." Rolling my eyes, I tried to stand up but Alec was quicker.

He hadpinned between his legs before I could run off. Since he was on the edge of the chair, I was standing, facing the windows. "This doesn't bother you?" Alec lifted my shirt and nibbled on another spot on my side.

"Nope. Nothing." The physical pain I felt from trying not to reach was worse than anything I've put myself through recently. "Hmm. What about this?” His strong hands flippedaround so fast that I almost fell over. Moving my pants down, he licked another spot, just over my ovary.

"Nope." My voice betrayedwith showing the restraint I was trying to keep up.

"Your body said otherwise." Alec moaned as he switched sides.

"My mind and my body are two different things." Crossing my arms over my chest, I wasn't prepared for Alec to basically tackleonto the floor. My arms reached out to grab him out of pure reflex.

"Wha-" I tried to ask but he was back on my neck.

"Remember when we first mated and I made you orgasm without touching you?" Alec whispered.

The memories flashed in front of my eyes. He literally hadbegging for him, just from touching my sensitive spots. "I was young and unexperienced." Alec looked into my eyes and accepted the challenge. "By the tI am done with you, you will be begging for me." He said and his hand lifted up my shirt.

"I'm so confident that I will even help you out." Grabbing my shirt, I took it off and even unhooked my bra.

"Good luck, Mr. Alpha." Giving him whatever look, I just put my hands behind my head.

"You're going to regret that." Alec's eyes flashed black before going back to their dazzling green. Starting out at my neck, his tongue massaged my sensitive spot like he knew everything to makefeel it. The goosebumps ran down my body but I refused to move.

As he moved down, he stopped at my mark. His teeth nibbled to the point that it pinched a little but he didn't break skin. For a moment, I thought he was going to cheat and bite down but he did. He moved to my breast. Sucking under the left one, he pinched my right one.

I couldn't stop my eyes closing but it took all my training to keep my breathing level. Alec didn't seem phased as he moved to my side again. Taking his sweet time, he traced every inch, making sure he


didn't miss on. noveldrama

He was on the opposite side on where my sensitive spot was when he started nibbling my side. A sudden rush of pleasure shot throughso fast that I couldn't control the intake of air or stop my back from arching.

"Hmm." Alec moaned as he kept doing it.

was so surprised that I wasn't ever ible to a sound. My hands threaded hrough his hair and my brain went uzzy. As he kept his assault up, his and pushed my legs apart. Massaging right next to my opening le was teasingworse than he ver had. Juices were flowing as the ressure was building faster and aster. ¡w"Cum for me." Alec moaned in my head. With one last pinch, I exploded.

"Alec!" I yelled as my orgasm hit hard. Stars danced in front of my numb face and the world went dark.

"That's it, love." He growled out loud. His fingers still didn't enteras he moved down to my thigh. My breathing was heavy and he just sucked on my inner thigh.

I wanted in him inbut I refused to beg. Bitting my lip, I had to force myself from calling out. Instead, my head rolled back as my back arched. The fire was making us sweat. Moving my hands, I had to grab my own hair to keep from moving his head where I truly wanted it. His breath hovered above the most sensitive spot. "Had enough?" He asked as his tongue barely touched my clit.

"I'm good." I said through gritted teeth.

"Oh? You're good?" Alec said and sat up.

The physical ache was painful. I wanted his touch so bad. "I mean, whatever you want to do is fine." I shrugged, looking at him.

"I guess we can go to bed then." Alec moved to get up.

Damn. He was playing the gtoo. He walked over and started putting the fire out, leavinglaying alone and naked. Fine, two can play this game. Getting up, I walked to the kitchen The feeling of his eyes bent never leftas I intentiover as I opened the fridge. Pulling out the chocolate cake, I cut a big slice and put it on a plate before seductively licking the knife clean. After putting the cake back, I picked up my piece and a fork and walked pasted Alec. "Where are you going?" He asked.

"To bed. I just wanted something a little sweet to taste."











###Chapter 0537 

“Seriously?” Alec followed me into the bedroom. Sitting on the edge of the bed, I watched as Alec started getting undressed. His dick was slightly limp but not exactly standing at attention either.

“Want a bite?” I held out the fork to him. He took a pair of shorts and walked up to me. Deciding I needed to play harder, as he leaned down to take the cake, I accidentally touched his dick with the big slice.

Chocolate frosting got stuck on his tip.

“Oh, I'm sorry! Let me help.” Setting the cake down, I took his dick and licked the frosting off before letting it £0 again. By this time, his dick was rock hard.

Smiling up at him, he cleaned off my lips before picking up the cake again and taking another bite. Alec stood there for a moment and didn’t move.

Feeling a little frustrated, I stood up and allowed my breast to graze him.

Turning around, I purposely bent over and pulled back the covers. After climbing into bed, I kept the covers at my feet and took another bite.

“You coming to bed?” I asked.

Alec dropped his shorts and went to crawl over me. His elbow knocked on the plate just enough that the cake fel] over on my chest. “Oh, I’m sorry. Let me help.” Alec muttered as he moved my legs apart. Putting his knee firmly against me, he too the plate and put it on the night stand. €» Anything I was going to say was caught

of BEN id Ae ie in my throat as he started cleaning up the chocolate with his tongue. His knee moved, rubbing my clit as he cleaned the chocolate off my tits. I couldn’t stop my hands from threading through

his hair.

The pressure was building against as he went to bite my newly found spot.

The bite wasn’t firm enough to send me off the edge but I was so close that it was maddening.


“All done!” Alec said as he rolled over.

“That’s it?” I asked, still laying completely exposed.

“Yeah. I made you orgasm without touching you so I win. You are pretty sticking, you might need to take a shower.” Alec shrugged and rolled over. &9 |

I'was fucking pissed. Getting up, I stomped to the bathroom and shut the door. Turning the shower on, the steam instantly filled the room as I got in. My body still ached in need.

A slow smile spread across my face as I used my own fingers to satisfy my needs. “Oh.” I moaned in the mind- link as I worked my clit.

“What are you doing?” Alec asked in a husky voice.

“Satisfying myself since you were done.” I answered in a moan. “I'm SO wet.” “Stop that. Just wash your body and get back here.” Alec demanded.

“I'm almost there!” [ let all the arousal filled me up and pushed it over to Alec.

“OH!” OH! OH!” I moaned out loud as |

got myself off. &» Alec growled. His footsteps pounded as he almost broke down the bathroom door. “Get out.” He was pissed as he shut off the water.noveldrama

“Not sure why you are so mad? You said you were done so I just took care of it myself.” Shrugging, I grabbed the towel and started drying myself off.

Feeling rather proud of myself, Alec grabbed my arm and pulled me back to bed. “You are going to pay for that.” He said. My eyes landed on the ropes that have never been there before.

“What are those?” I asked as he tossed me in bed. He had one hand tied down before I could even protest. Moving to the other hand, I was trying to fight but he was sitting on my stomach,


pinning me down.

“I'am going to forced you to scream my name and then, only then will I fuck you.” Alec’s eyes flashed back before he went straight for my tits.

He didn’t even hesitate as he started massaging my already swollen clit. My body tensed under him as he worked.

As hard as I tried to fight it, I couldn't.

The pressure was building instantly before he would stop and let go of me.

He laid on top of me so his dick was grazing me and he moved to my mark.

“Say the words love and all your pain will go away.” He muttered.

I opened my mouth to speak but nothing was coming out. My breathing was so rapid that [ was struggling to even moisten my mouth. With little

pressure, his dick moved. Barely grazing me to the point it was maddening. ee Alec grabbed my neck and pulled my hair as I was looking up at him. I knew my cheeks were flushed and the tension in me was so thick that I couldn’t even form a word.

“Can’t speak?” He asked, amused. He kept gently moving his dick as my eyes rolled back in my head. I even tried willing my orgasm to hit and moved my hips to try to make it harder.

Alec moved his other hand down to my leg. Grabbing my thigh, he pulled my leg up so it was a different pressure on me. With his hand firmly squeezing my ass, his dick barely touching my clip and his other hand pulling my hair, I was completely lost. €»

A edad fg His lips pressed firmly against mine as he kissed me hard. “Say the words and I'll fuck you so hard that you forget | who you are.” He whispered in my mouth. Leaning back, he raised an eyebrow at me and waited.

Closing my mouth, I tried to gather enough mental awareness to mutter a word. “Please.” “What was that?” He asked. Turning his head, he acted like he didn’t hear me.

“Fuck me, Daddy.” That did the trick. Alec shoved his dick into me so fast and ripped my head back even further, Holding onto the ropes for my life, Alec pounded away.

The pressure instantly exposed as I screamed out. Alec instantly covered my mouth with his, As | orgasmed, his

body shuddered and emptied everything he had.











###Chapter 0538

"How are you feeling this morning?" Alec asked as I was getting dressed. Alec kept true to his word and I think I got maybe two hours of sleep last night.

"Well rested." I wasn't happy he won but damn if it wasn't enjoyable.

The humor that cfrom Alec maderoll my eyes at him. "If you say so." "Where did the rope cfrom?" I asked. Since we were going shopping, I didn't want to wear anything too much but the snow was still falling. I would need to wear my boots so I opted for skinny jeans and a nice fitted long sleeve shirt. There was a thin layer of make up on and my hair was left down and straight.

"Been saving it for the right time." Alec muttered as my phone rang.

"You're up early." I said as I answered the call.

"Yeah, Jasper needed to do something so I got up. What are you doing today?" Emmy asked.

"Going shopping for a dress with Penny. Want to come?" "Oh! Could I?" Emmy sounded excited.

"Of course you can. Get dressed and get over here." "Okay!" Emmy hung up onas Adalynn started crying.

"The roads are going to be slick so be careful." Alec stood up and started buckling his pants.

"I'm going to take the jeep. What are you doing to do today?" I asked as I walked out of our room and into Adalynn's room. She was sitting up, looking at the door. "Good morning!" I said in a sweet voice. Adalynn raised her hands up to me.

Picking her up, she laid her head on my shoulder for a few seconds until she heard her dad. "Someone is happy this morning." Adalynn sat up and reached for her dad. "Seriously?" Rolling my eyes, I handed her over to a very happy dad.

"Daddy loves you." Alec whispered in her ear as went to the closet.

"Then daddy can change her and get her dressed." I said slightly annoyed and with a melted happy heart.

"Mommy is just sad she is second in daddy's life now." Alec said in a baby voice.

"Can you say that again so I can record your baby voice for the warriors you have to go work with today?" I pulled out my phone and took a picture.

"Only if I can record all the sounds you made last night... oh wait! I had you too numb to speak." Alec smirked atas he finished dressing Adalynn.

As I opened my mouth to respond, the door bell rang. "Ass." I muttered as I walked off. Alec's laughed echoed across the halls. "Hey!" I said as I let Vivian inside.

"It's slick out there!" Vivian was dressed head to toe in so much gear that I even wondered if she was a wolf. noveldrama

"I bet! Glad you made it here okay. I'm not sure what kids you will have today." "That's fine!" "She hasn't had breakfast yet but Alec is changing her and getting her dressed." I said as he walked around the corner.

"She's ready." Alec said as he carried her in front of him. Adalynn got a huge smile on her face as she saw Vivian. Clapping her hands together, she reached for her.

"Someone is happy this morning!" Vivian laughed as she took her and headed to the kitchen.

"Do you need anything before we head to the garage?" I asked.

Pubfuture Ads
"Nope. We are good!" Vivian put Adalynn in her highchair and started cutting up a banana.

"Love you!" I said and kissed Adalynn on the forehead. Alec did the sand we headed to the garage.

Don't you think it's tfor another >ne?" Alec asked as I grabbed my coat. Alec was putting on his gloves and bat before he grabbed the hovel. w"It's not like you have been preventing one." I frowned at him. "I would still like a little more tbetween." Hitting the button to open the garage, Atec walked up behind me.

As I turned, he grabbed my hair and pulled my head back so I was looking at him. My eyes instantly rolled back on their own. S "I want them to be as close as you are with Colt. We need to have an army close together." Alec pressed his lips against mine. "I don't want triplets!" I laughed as I kissed him back.

Unfortunately, a honking sound interrupted us. Alec was annoyed as he walked away fromand got the shovel. "Letclear ssnow for you." "Hey!" Emmy smiled at Alec as he started shoveling. Alec just tilted his head in response but Emmy didn't seem to care. "Ready to go?" "Almost. Alec is clearing ssnow and Penny should be here soon. I wanted to make sure I had an emergency kit in the jeep." There was jumper cables next to a tote. "What's in there?" Emmy asked as I picked it up.

“Blanket, water, granola bar and other stuff like that.” Another car caround as I put it in my trunk. "Penny's here!" "Great! Let's go!" Emmy got in the passenger seat.

"Emmy? Are you coming with us?" Penny asked with a smile.

"Is that okay? I need a dress too." "Of course!" Penny walked up to Alec. She muttered something I didn't hear and walked back to us. Alec nodded and walked back into the garage.

"It should be okay for you but it has started snowing more. Try not to drag this out and make it hsafely." Penny got in the jeep to give us sprivacy. "Will do." I stood by the driver's side door as he walked up to me.

"I mean it. Be safe, Kristen. I don't want a phone call saying you are in a ditch.

lec looked atwith more emotion than I'm used to. "Like you said, you could be pregnant now." "So, you are worried about any potential baby, not the incubator?" Folding my arms, I popped out my hip.

Alec rolled his eyes at me. “Just be safe.” He kissed my forehead and turned to leave.

"Bye!" I yelled as I got in.

"Can we do doughnuts?" Emmy asked, making Alec freeze. He turned his head and glared at her.

Emmy blew a kiss at Alec as I pulled out of the garage. "Do you have a death wish?" Penny asked, trying to hind her uncomfortableness.






###Chapter 0539

“No, why?” Emmy looked back at Penny.

“Alec doesn’t scare you?”

“Alec scares you?” | asked.

Penny shrugged. “I don’t exactly get a warm fuzzy feeling around him. At least Jasper jokes and smiles. Alec stands there with his

arms crossed, just staring.”

“Like a sexy mysterious man.” Dancing my shoulders, | looked back at her and smiled. “He smiles plenty.”

“If you say so.” Penny looked out the window as Emmy looked atand tried to hide her laughter.

“Emmy, get ssongs going!”

Grabbing my phone since it was connected via bluetooth, she pulled out my playlist. “Let’s do this one.”

All-American Rejects con. Dirty little Secret was one of my favorite songs on this play list. The whole playlist had different

artist like Foo Fighters, Shaggy, Puddle of Mudd, Fountains of Wayne and Smash Mouth. We jammed out the whole way to the store

without slipping once.

“Shit it’s cold!” Emmy whined as we made our way into the store.

“| like it. The snow is so relaxing!” Penny said a little too sweetly.

“White bullshit is what it is.” Emmy and | fist bumped as Penny laughed.

“What style are you guys looking for?” Penny had looked over at the ball gowns.

“l am going for sex appeal all he way. I'm going to make Alec suffer like he did tolast night.”

“What?” Emmy looked atwith her eyebrows raised.

Waving her off, | looked at Penny. “Are you wanting a ball gown?”

Penny looked around, she seemed a little confused. “I'm not sure what | want.” noveldrama


“Can | help you ladies?” A female voice cup to my right.

“Yes. We have a winter ball to go to and she needs help finding the right dress.” Pointing at Penny, | made her blush.

“| love dressing women. Do you girls need help?” She asked Emmy and me.

“Nope. We know what we like.”

“Perfect. Dressing rooms are in the far corner. | am going to take...” She looked at Penny, looking for a name.

“Penny.” | said for her.

“I'm going to take Penny and look around.”

“Perfect! See you soon!”

Penny looked down right scared as the worker took her arm and lead her away. After looking around, Emmy and | both had a hand

full of dresses. Penny hadn’t made it to the dressing room yet so we went head and started trying them on.

The first one was a Emerald green with tones of sparkle and shimmers. It was completely suctioned to my body the whole way

down. The top collected at one shoulder and looped around the back to make a sleeve for the opposite arm. Otherwise, the back

was completely open to the top of my ass. | wasn’t a huge fan of the green but it would look so great with Alec's eyes. Plus, he was

used towearing black or red that this would be a shock factor.

Coming out, | looked at Emmy. Her dress was a dark midnight blue, almost black to the point that | had to really look. It was also

completely fitted with long sleeves. However, the top of the dress was lined with sliver band of sparkles that dipped on the left, just

at her armpit. As she turned, each other went down and met at her left hip, making her back mostly open. The opening was lined

with a thick strap of sparkles the entire way. After her hips, it fell to the ground where mine hugged my legs.

“That looks amazing on you!” | made her do a little twirl.

I can't believe you picked green! It

its you ike aglove. Alecwill

lefiantly have a hard tkeeping

iis ands off you.” Emmy nodded in

w©

“That is the hope!”

“You girls look amazing!” Penny's voice brought out attention over to them.

“Did you find some?” | asked.

“We did!” The sales lady helped Penny into a room.

“| think we have that sone in white.” The sales lady looked at my dress.

“Oh, white would really make you stand out!” Emmy nodded.

“] would need to get sself tanner.”

“I'll go get it for you to try on.” She smiled atand walked away.

“Holy shit, Penqy!” Turning around,

Penny was tearing a deep purple

dress with [ace see-through sleeves.

The shafow V-neck line had a lacy”

patted at cto her upperg™’

waist. The whole dress dropped

down in a silk skirt but there was a

‘Damn girl’ Penny always had a Oo

figure butshe was more reserved-on

what she wanted to show. Thigwas

so fay out of the box that | cauld

read the hesitancy on her face.

Gontent

“ls it too much?” Penny asked as she looked at herself in the mirror.

The sales woman cback with the white dress for me. “That looks amazing on you!”

Penny took a deep breath and straightened her back. “I am a grown woman and | want to look sexy for my

mate. | can do this!” With new conviction, she turned and looked at us. “This is my dress.”

“Whoo!” | cheered as | took the white dress.

Going back to the changing room, | switched the green for the all white version. It would defiantly stick out.

“Which color? Green or white?” | asked as | stepped out.

“Definitely white.” Penny nodded.

“Good! Just need to buy sself tanner and I'll be set. | have swhite heel that will work perfectly for this dress.”

“Awesome! I'll meet you girls at the register!” The sales lady clapped her hands together and walked away.

“You can try on more if you want to.” | told Penny.

“Nope. | am stepping out of my comfort zone and going to be rocking this.”

Emmy walked towards her. “If | may, wear your hair in a low messy bun with whispies.”

“How about you just do my hair.” Penny looked at her.

Laughing, “How about we just get ready at my house?”

“Sounds good. Can Sherry ctoo?”

“Of course she can!” After one last look in the mirror, | went to take off my dress. Alec was going to be hurting soon!













###Chapter 0540 

Emmy laid our dresses down in the back as we piled back into my jeep.

“That was so much fun!” Penny was extra excited for her dress.

“I can’t wait! This ball will be so much fun.” Emmy started dancing as I put the car in drive. The snow was really coming down to the point that it felt more like a blizzard than just regular SNOW.

“Ice, you're getting a call.” Emmy said as she handed me back my phone.

“Hey, love. What’s up?” “It’s getting pretty bad out. Where are you girls?” Alec seemed a little worried.

“Headed home. I'm driving slow and

just got on the highway.” “Good. Did you guys find dresses?” Alec seemed distracted but he would have hung up if he didn’t want to make sure we made it okay.

“We did. I'm really excited fo-" “KRISTEN! WATCH OUT!” Emmy screamed. She pointed to the tree line and four rogues came charging out.

“What's happening?” I heard Alec asked as I had only a second before they slammed into my jeep.

“ALEC!” I screamed as my phone went flying out of my hands. End over end, my jeep rolled down the side of the bank and landed in a small frozen stream. The stream empted into a small pond below.

It took me a second to focus but as 2/0

| soon as reality came shooting back, so did the noise. The snarls of the rogues trying to get into my jeep were.

something else but it was Penny crying that caught my attention.


The jeep was on the side and Penny’s arm was stuck between the jeep and the frozen ground. I was laying on top of Emmy who was trying to move.

“Ice!” She said weakly. Looking at her, she pointed at the windshield. It was completely shattered but what I could see was a rogue, looking at me... yet he wasn’t dirty or even foaming at the mouth.

“Emmy, does that look like a rogue to you?” I asked as the snarls stopped. I could see them circle the jeep, trying to find a way in. The issue was, Alec had this jeep reinforced. Penny had to have

had her window cracked for it to shattered like it was.

“No. They don’t.” Bl Suddenly, the jeep started to lift up and fall back down. “AWWW” Penny screamed as it came crashing down on her arm again.

“Shit, they are trying to flip us over.

Where is my phone?” “Here.” Emmy held up a completely busted phone. “Alec heard us though.

He will come, right?” Looking at Emmy, I could see the fear in her eyes. “Yes but until then, Emmy, we are going to have to fight. Put your fear away and pull our that inner warrior.” “What about Penny?” Emmy nodded and I could see the shift in her wolf.

“Penny can’t fight. We are going to have to hold them off till help gets here.” As soon as I said this, the jeep flipped around and landed back on it’s wheels.

“Ready?” Emmy asked as she looked back at Penny.

“AARRGG!” Penny moved to the other side of the jeep. A rogue had put his head in the window, trying to get her.

Climbing over the center console, I tried to kick the rogue has hard as I could in the nose. It worked enough that I could use the door and slam it into his head. “NOW!” I yelled. Emmy and I jumped out and shifted into our wolves. Within seconds, we stood between four rogues and Penny.

“Ice, these aren’t rogues.” Emmy said in the mind-link.


“I know but I am a fucking alpha and you are my beta. Use your strength and take these fuckers down.” I said as Sierra snapped at one that was getting too close. One of them jumped and she met them in the air.

Using her hind legs, she kicked it back and landed on one trying to get to Penny. Bitting down on his shoulder, it reared back trying to throw me.

Sierra used it to toss the rogue off to the side as the first one came back.

Dodging the lunge, she kicked in the head. Right as she went in for the kill, a sharp pain erupted on her thigh.

As much as it hurt, it only pissed her off more. Using her claws, she grabbed his neck and dug them in. His teeth

instantly leg go but she pulled her other hand around and dug her claws in. Pulling it apart, his neck split wide open, almost completely decapitating him.

The original wolf came barreling into Sierra, sending her into another wolf that was trying to get Emmy. The three of us rolled down the hill a bit more before our wolves broke the ice.

Sierra was not a swimmer and instantly changed back into our human form. Since I had the lead, I tried my best to grab ahold of the ice.

Something sharp dug into my ankle and pulled me under.

Looking down, the rogues had shifted and the guy was trying to use my body to pull himself back up. The water was pressing down on us, making it hard to

kick him loose but somehow I managed.

My lungs cried for air as I reached the surface. “KRISTEN!” I heard Emmy as I struggled to grip something. The ice was slippery with the water.

“EMMY!” I screamed. “BEHIND YOU!” All I saw was more wolves coming down the hill. My body was giving out and I was struggling to stay above the water. noveldrama

Something brown got tossed into the water. I wasn’t sure what it was but I grabbed it. Pulling me up, I didn’t have the strength to grip it enough and I fell back in.

Pictures of Alec holding Adalynn flashed before my eyes as my lungs filled up with water. The cold stopped feeling cold and a warmth surrounded

me. More pictures of Adalynn smiling, laughing and then pictures of Alec holding me, telling me he loved me. It was all I could do but smile as the surface of the water got further and further away.









###Chapter 0541

“DAMNIT BREATHE!” | heard before something heavy pounded my chest.

“KRISTEN!” Emmy's cries broughtback as the water expelled from my body.

“She’s alive!” | heard someone yell before my body was picked up and wrapped tightly in something warm.

“She needs a hospital fast!” | wasn’t even sure who was carryingas | was lifted up. The cold ran bone deep and | couldn't stop

shaking.

“Give her here.” | heard someone say before | was passed off. It wasn't a moment later that the blanket was ripped from my frozen

grip and | was pressed against a warm body. The sparks toldAlec had found me.

“Drive.” Alec said angerly as he positionedon his chest. My body was completely covered but he kept opened it to look at me. noveldrama

“Stay awake. Don’t you dare close your eyes.” He growled and commanded me.

“Nnnnice....ttttry.” | said as my teeth chattered together.

“What won't work?” Alec asked in confusion.

“Commmmmandddding mmmme.” It hurt to breath. Hurt to move but | tried to get my body as tightly against Alec as | could. His

arms were tight, holdingagainst him.

“Don’t talk right now. Just stay away.” Alec said a little softer.

“Nnnnnooot rrrrooggggues.” | tried to speak again.


“Shhh, we will talk later.” Alec moved hish ands up and down my body to try to warm me.

“Two minutes.” | heard someone say.

My mind was becoming clearer as the shivering wasn’t so violent. “Pppppennny? “Eeemmmy?”

“They are alive.” Alec grunted as the car cto a stop. He pulledout into the cold, makingshrink back and hold onto

him.

“Put her here!” | heard a woman say.

Alec listened and setdown but | didn’t want him to letgo. “Nnnnno!” | tried to reach for him but he wasn’t there.

“Weak pulse, slurred speech, her breathing is shallow and she is blue!” | heard voices but | wasn’t comprehending. Where was Alec

and what happened to Emmy and Penny?

“Get an L.V. going. Sir, you are going to have to wait outside.” A male voice said. My body reacted on it’s own and moved away

from his voice.

“NO! NO!" | screamed as Darin’s face flashed before my eyes. “DON'T TOUCH ME!” | tried slapping their hands away. The light was

too bright and | couldn’t see anything. “DON'T TOUCH ME, DARIN!” | screamed.

“Kristen!” Alec's voice sounded beside me. “Darin is dead. You are alive. You are not trapped there anymore. Listen to me. Listen to

my voice.” My body instantly relaxed as | heard his voice.

“Alec?” | asked as a sob hit me. “Too bright.”


“We have to get an I.V in her before her body shuts down from the cold. She is hypothermic and will die!” The male voice said.

Shrinking away from him, | held onto Alec like my life depended on it. “She has been through sever trauma in the past. Is there a

female doctor? She isn’t afraid of females.” | heard a voice | recognized.

“Kristen. | am a nurse and | want to help you. Can | touch you?” The softest voice sounded to me.

| didn’t speak but | nodded yet. Between her and Alec, they movedback to the middle of the bed. Alec kept ahold of my hand

the entire time. “Let her save you, love.” Alec whispered to me.

“Can | start an 1.V.?” She asked as she stroke my arm.

Again, | nodded yes. “Can we turn the lights down?” The familiar voice asked.

“Letget the I.V. in and then we can.” The soft voice said. Something tight wrapped around my arm before a pinch in my hand.

The tightness went away and warmth spread through my body. “Okay, you can dim the lights.”

The lights went away and | was able to try to open my eyes. “I am going to put this heating blanket on you.” Looking through one

eye, | saw a female nurse say to me.

Nodding, she removed the blanket that was onand put a heavier one on my naked body. “I am going to have to look at that

bite mark.”

“Her ankle is broken too.” As | was able to look through my eyes, | saw Colt standing in the corner of the room with his arms folded.

A hand rested on my head and stroke my hair, makinglook over at Alec. He looked fucking pissed and scared at the stime.


“What happened?” | asked.

“What do you remember?” He asked as the nurse lifted the blanket and inspected my thigh. The door opened and another female

cin.

“A female doctor was requested then why are there two men in here?” She asked in a very disapproving way.

“One is her brother and the other is her husband.” | knew the nurse was a wolf but the doctor was human.

“Injuries?” The doctor looked at my chart.

“Broken ankle and hypothermia.”

“What about the thigh?” The doctor asked.

“Old wound from awhile ago. It's healing nicely, | just wanted to check it to make sure the crash didn’t disturb it.” The nurse waved

off the doctor's concern.

“Let's get an x-ray and see how bad the ankle is. Do you have a heated I.V in there?” The doctor looked at the fluids.

“] do. Her pulse is getting better and the confusion is less. She is mentally becoming more aware of her surroundings.” The nurse

looked atand nodded.

“Great. Letknow when the radiographs are back.” She said and walked out.

“Bitch.” I couldn't help myself.

“Yes well, your bite marks do look okay. If there was anything, the cold water killed it all. Your color is looking better but | want to

do this bag and another bag of fluids before your mate takes you home.”

“Any long lasting injuries?” Colt asked.

“] don’t think so. As soon as we get out of the danger zone of hypothermia, she will get her wolf back and she will heal her in one

time. Everything she said was her subconscious coming back out. Like you said, her past trauma is still with her. As soon as she is

warm, she can go home.” The nurse smiled and walked out.














###Chapter 0542

“Ppenny? Emmmy?” | tried to keep the shiver out of my voice.

“Everyone is fine. Penny has a broken her arm but she is fine. You saved Emmy when you rolled over the one rogue and she was

able to finish the other one off. We got there just in tfor one of my men to jump in and save you.”

“One of your men?” | asked, confused.

“l had sguys scouting an area. They were only a few minutes away form your location. | swear to everything that is holy. If you

ever fucking crash again and | am on the phone with you...” Alec shook his head. | felt the despite, almost scared feeling he had.

“The jeep would have kept us safe if Penny’s window wasn’t down. You did a great job reinforcing it.” | tried to reassure him.

“Penny and Emmy want to cin.” Colt said quietly.

“They can cin.”

Colt opened the door and Emmy stuck her head in. “Are you okay?” She asked quietly. Slowly, they made their way inside.

“Please tellour dresses survived?” | asked. Alec snorted but refused to let go of my hand.

“They did.” Emmy smiled at me.

“I'm so sorry!” Penny had a tear stained face as she walked up to me. “I was feeling a little hot and wanted sair.” A fresh wave

of tears ran down her face.


“It's okay! Don’t cry. It wasn’t your fault those rogues hit us.”

“Alec, those weren't rogues.” Emmy said, firmly as she looked at Alec. noveldrama

“We know.” Alec said. The anger that filled him was intense.

“You know?” | asked, looking at him.

“Colt got a good look at them. Between them and the ones that attack his pack, something is going on.” Alec said but we fell quiet

as the nurse cin to change my LV.

“How are you feeling?” She smiled warmly at me.

“Like I'll never get warm.” | was so cold that my bones were shivering.

“In time. your tempature is already improving so good. I'm going to take an x-ray of your ankle real quick.”

Everyone moved off to the side as she placed something under my ankle. Moving the machine over me, she positionedjust

right and clicked the button. The x-ray instantly showed up on the screen.

“Yeah, we need to reset it. Do you wantto numb it before | do it?”

“No, just do it.” | said as | squeezed Alec’s hand harder. Colt cover and took my other hand.

“On the count of th-" She snapped it quickly. A sharp pain shot up my leg but | didn’t cry out. Instead, my jaw clenched shut as |

tried to steady my breathing. “Impressive. Most people can’t handle that.”


“That isn’t my first joint to be out of place.” | said before | realized what | said. Her body froze for a second before she decided to

ignore that comment.

“You will need a boot but you will probably be healed in a few days. Don’t over do it.”

“No cast?” Colt asked.

“She will heal before we could even get her back to take if off. A boot will keep it in place to heal. It's pretty minor so a boot will be

fine.” She typed a few things out and then looked at me. “I'll get it and sclothes for you. I'll be back to get you discharged.”

“Thank you.” | said as she walked out the door.

“Who do you think is behind it all?” Penny asked. Looking over, she was holding onto Colt’s arm with her good arm. The fear in her

eyes was clear.

“Hard to say.” Alec said quietly.

“The weird thing was there was only four. It’s like it was planned but very poorly.” | kept feeling like | was missing something.

“Like they underestimated your abilities.” Colt was still clearly pissed off.

“Exactly.”

“Everyone is dead. Who else would want to cafter us?” Emmy asked.

“Someone from Italy?” Penny asked.


“Doubt it but | guess it's possible.

“Why don’t you guys bring the car around. My 1.V is almost done and | want to get out of here as soon as | can. | want want to see

my daughter.”

“Ice...” Emmy looked nervous. “...you almost died. You DID die. A-are you okay?”

“| thought the sappy Emmy went away after she gave birth?” | gave her a look that made her smile.

“That was not a good look on me.” Emmy laughed as she turned and walked out.

Penny followed her but Colt stopped and looked at me. “Ice?”

| gave him a weak smile and tired to tell him that | loved him and | was okay. He must have gotten the message and nodded at me

before looking at Alec. “I'll be by later this evening after she gets settled.”

“Sounds good.” Alec muttered before Colt walked out.

“Kristen...” Alec shook his head like he couldn't find the words to say what he wanted to say.

“I'm okay.” | tried to tell him again.

“You're not. You thought you were back being tortured by Darin.” Alec looked atlike | stabbed him in the heart.

“It was the sthing. Joint out of place, | was barely alive and | wasn’t aware of what was going on around me. Alec, | looked up

and saw the hole getting further and further away. Memories of you and Adalynn flashed before my eyes. | should have died but

you saved me. You savedlast tand you savedthis time. You are my hero.”

| tried to reach over and kiss him but my body was too sore. “Don’t move.” Alec sighed and kissed my forehead.

“| want to go to bed with you and just lay there.”

“We can. However, we need to get your home. You can take a long hot shower and the curl up in front of the fire.”

“We could do what we did last night... that will warmright up.” | tried to look seductively at him.










###Chapter 0543

“Woman...” Alec shook his head but looked atjust like | pictured. “You need to stop trying to die on me. Do you know what it’s like to watch your

mate lifeless under your arms? You take a piece ofwith you every tthis happens.”

“I didn’t try to go in the water. | tried to get out.” | felt bad he went through this but it wasn't like | put myself in that position.

“I know. Look at the bruises that are forming on your arms.”

Pulling the blanket to the side, my arm slipped out from under the heated blanket. Deep purple bruises were forming on my arms. There was multiple

spots where my arms hit the edge of the ice. “Oh.”

There was a soft knock on the door a moment before the nurse looked in. “How are you feeling?” She asked. Walking in, she had a medical boot and

clothes with her.

“Ready to go home.”

“I bet. Lettake the 1.V. out. | have a wheel chair for you. As much as you probably don’t want it, you body is still not functioning property. Until you

get back to a normal temp, be careful holding babies, anything breakable or doing anything strenuous. You will probably be sore tomorrow but again,

your wolf will heal you. If | may, take a hot shower and body heat is the best way to keep your body tempature where it needs to be.”

She had pulled the I.V out and put a bandage over it. “Sounds good.” | said as | tried to sit up. She was right, | was incredibly weak.

“I don't have anything warmer than scrubs.” The nurse frowned. “Did you still have the blanket you brought her in?” She asked Alec.

“Yeah, I'll have them bring it.” Alec sighed as he helpedsit up. Together, they gotdressed and the nurse but on the boot.

“Can you carry her to the wheelchair?” The nurse asked as she helpedswing my legs around.

“Sure.”

“Gently.” | said as my body protested

“Still think you are up for sex?” Alec asked in the mind-link.

“Of course. I'll just lay there and you can do all the work.” | said as he placedin the wheelchair. It was just outside the room so | saw Jasper walk

up with the blanket.

“Damn, luna. You look like shit.” He joked.

Alec growled and | laughed. Which hurt. “Even half dead, | look better than you.”

“Luna?” The nurse asked, she took a step back and looked at Alec. “What pack are you from?”

“Black Moon Pack.” Alec said.

“I should have recognized your names. I'm part of Alpha Jace’s pack.”

“Little far from home, aren't you?” Alec asked.

“I am. | am part of a traveling nursing program. It was a pleasure to meet you both. | hope next t| see you it isn’t in the hosptial.” She bowed and

started to walk away.

“What was your name?” | asked, quickly.

“Melonie.” She answered with a smile.

“Please cto our winter ball next weekend. You can ask Jace about details.”

“I will, thank you.” She waved before walking away.

“Let's go.” Alec pushed the wheel chair down the hall but stopped before going outside. “Where is the car?”

“To the left.” Jasper said and went outside. He motioned for the car to pull forward so | didn’t have to be in the cold any longer. It was still snowing.

As soon as it pulled up, Alec pickedup and carriedout to the SUV. Jasper opened the door and Alec climbed in the middle. He followed us


and got in the back with Emmy. Colt and Penny were up front.

“Let's go.” Alec grumbled as he got us situated. | was still on his lap with my head on his shoulder.

“Can | sleep now?” | asked in the mind-link.

“Yes, love. You are safe. | have you.” Alec squeezedtighter and | closed my eyes. Grabbing a fist full of his shirt, it didn’t take long forto let

the blackness fill me.

“Love, we are here.” Alec was rubbing my back as he tried to wakeup.

“Already?” | yawned as | saw my house in the windows.

“Yeah. You need to take a shower to finish warming up. Then we will get you in scomfy clothes.”

Alec didn't verbally answer but when

the door shut J assumed he nodded.

Alec carriedine all the way to the «_

bath room, Sitti ngon the toilet”

he turned the shower on. He dign't

say afything as he took my boot off

a nd.then gotund ressed: Pie got

himself undressed and then helped


At first the water was too much so

Alec turned itZdown until | got

comfortaplethen turned it up. Soon,

my shivers stopped and my skin &

turned-red. Thankfully, we had a noveldrama

benctithat Alec could siton as

he-washed my hair and the my

bady. As the water hit meshe

washed his body.


After he was done, he kneeled in front of me. “How are you feeling? Do you want to sit here longer?”

“Of course.” Alec stood and moved to get out.

That surprised him that | was

showing thisghuch vulnerability.

Usually, I likexto be alone but right N

now, | waited him with me. <

Thankfully, he didn't respond but he

pickeup and sat down, pitting

regre of comfort. Leaning

rested my head on his cliest,

relaxing to his breathing patterns.












###Chapter 0544

"I think I'm ready now." I told Alec after a few more minutes of us sitting here.

He stood up and helpedout of the shower before turning it off. There was a towel on the toilet he saton so he could dryoff easier. As soon as he dried my body, he wrapped a towel around his body. I took a brush and brushed my hair as he went to the bedroom to get us clothes.

He cback as soon as I was done brushing my hair. Alec helpedinto a thick pair of sweats and a long sleeve shirt. He put sock on my feet before putting my boot on.

I expected him to helpto the livingroom but instead, he picked up the blow dryer and started working on my hair. It was a little awkward as he wasn't exactly sure how to do this but I appreciated the effort. By the end, my hair was dry. Grabbing a clip, I clipped it back.

"I'm ready." Putting my arm around his neck, he helpedto oversized chair. Givingthe fluffiest blanket we had, he got a fire started. "Do you want anything hot to drink? Coffee? Hot chocolate?" A knock on the door keptfrom answering. "Colt's here already?" "No, that's Jasper." Alec said as he went to the door.

I heard Emmy walk in with my dress. She went straight to my closet and hung it up. "How are you feeling?" Jasper walked in front ofand held out a cup.

"Sore." I said as I reached out and took it.

"Emmy said you might want shot chocolate.” Jasper said as she cout of the bedroom. Alec went back to the fire.

"Thank you." I said as Emmy crawled under the blanket and sat beside me.

"You saved my life today." Emmy whispered.

"Sounds like you need to start training again." I said as I took a sip.noveldrama

"How's your thigh?" Jasper asked.

"It's fine. I'm really just sore from trying to get on the ice." "The bite didn't go too deep. Plus, the cold water helped stop any bleeding so it's really looking good." Alec said as he stood up.

"I bet you are tired. We can talk tomorrow if need be?" Jasper looked atand then over at Alec.

"Where's Adalynn?" I asked Alec.

"She is in her room sleeping. Vivian just left." That really sucked. I knew the hospital stay forcedto miss her bedtbut part ofwas hoping she was awake. "It's fine. We can talk now." I said but I really just wanted everyone to go away.

"You sure?" Emmy asked.


"Yeah, we are sleeping in tomorrow so don't call me." The hot chocolate felt amazing as it went down my throat.

The front door opened. Turning, we watched Colt walk in, take off his boots and cinto the livingroom.

"You're looking better." He said as he crouched down next to me. The back of his hand touched my cheek and forehead before he stood up and frowned. "Still feeling cold." "The shower really helped." "Did you find anything out?" Alec got straight to it. He wasn't in the mood to talk but it was either now or in the morning.

"No. The men in the lake aren't going to be able to be retrieve. It's too cold for divers right now. The one I assSierra killed is unrecognizable. So, we have one of them. He's not on any data base for where he might belong. There aren't any markings on him either." "We we have nothing." "How is he unrecognizable?" Jasper asked.

"She had his head between her legs. Reaching around, her claws dug into his neck and pulled it apart. Part of his face might have cwith it." I shrugged.

"Damn." Jasper shook his head and looked at Emmy.

"Can I start training again?" She asked him.

"Yeah, okay." Jasper shook his head and looked at Alec.

"We have nothing to go on." "Maybe it was a freak thing?" Emmy tried.

Alec folded his arms and sat down on the fireplace. His eyes stayed onfor the most part unless he was talking to someone. “Highly unlikely. We need to think about who else it could be." "So far, their attempts have been pretty minimal. The attack at my pack was smaller and they sent four to attack the girls. That trip was a last minute decision. It might have been an opportunity kind of thing." Colt tried to rationalize things. "There are still people who supported Rip. They could have just seen the girls and said, why not." "Let's stay alert and hope these are just normal pack attacks. We all know the risks of traveling to neutral territory." Colt tried to down play it like it wasn't a direct attack on us.

"Hey! Why are you assuming it will bethat gets hurt? Next tit is your turn!" "Nope. Next tI am going to throw you in front of them to save myself. I just need to be faster than you." My eyes traveled down her body and back up. Giving her a disapproving look.

"Exactly, you are suppose to die to protect me. If I happen to toss you in harms way to save myself, no one will be around to ratout. You will be dead." Shrugging, it was really her loss. "Sorry for you luck."













###Chapter 0545 

“To think I brought you your dress even.” Emmy shook her head at me.

“It’s really anyone else’s turn to get hurt. I’m tired of being that person.” “Hey! I got hurt pretty bad last time! I almost died!” Jasper raised his hands up in his defense. noveldrama

“True.” I nodded. “I still saved your ass.” “Getting back to the topic at hand.” Colt sighed. “I haven't heard back from the other alphas. They will all be here next weekend for the ball. So far, none of them have been attacked so other than being aware, I’m not sure what

else we can do.” “I have to go to the shop tomorrow.” “I'll swing by and check on you.” Colt offered.

“I'll be around as well. There are a few things I need to do.” Alec stood up and cracked his knuckles.

“Isn’t Calvin suppose to start tomorrow?” Emmy asked.

“Yeah. He passed his classes and is ready to start. I have a few people lined up that have multiple tattoos that are willing to let him work on them. I promised I would fix any fuck ups for no charge.” I said as I yawned.

“Let’s get going.” Jasper looked at his watch. “We need to get up early as well.”


Emmy sighed but wiggled out from the chair. “I'll bring you lunch at the shop.” “Sounds good. Make it something hot.” “Will do.” Emmy reached out and squeezed my hand before she walked to the front door.

“Feel better.” Jasper said as he was passed. “Thank you for saving Emmy.” “Anytime.” What was I going to do, let her die? As soon as they were out of the door, Colt came over and sat down on the edge of the chair. “Ice, you’re not okay.” It was a statement, not a question.

“I'honestly don’t know why I went

there. When I set fire to the packhouse, Ilet go of all the hatred and negative feelings. I haven't even thought about that whole ordeal.” “It was a very real trauma. Suppression isn’t healing. You have to stop pushing your feelings down and work through them.” Colt put his hand on my boot.

“Exactly how do you suppose I do that? Everyone is dead. There isn’t a reason I should still have any negative feelings and it isn’t like I am walking around reliving it. I’ve been going to work by myself. I've raised Adalynn and never once have I had a thought about it. I don’t feel anything.” “What do you feel?” Colt pushed.

“Right now, cold.”

Colt gave me a look that told me he wasn’t happy with my answer. “Come on, be serious. I'm worried about you.” “I don’t know what you want me to say. I don’t dream about it. Have I woken up crying or yelling out?” Looking at Alec.

“No.” “All I can say is it was very similar. It was a near death experience and my mind just related the two. I wasn’t sure what was going on around me and a trauma like that isn’t something someone get’s over. It’s something you learn to live with and I think I’ve adapted very well.” I looked at Alec for help. “Have I not been checking in more? I've been more open about my feelings. Hell, I even made you stay in


the shower with me so I wasn’t alone.” “I’m just saying I’m worried about you. Seeing you thrash around on the hospital bed was a deja vu that I didn’t need to have. It affects us too when you almost die.” “I promise I will try to work on whatever is going on with me when I figure it out.” I wasn’t sure what he wanted me to say. I still didn’t believe I had a problem.

Colt gave me a look but eventually gave up. “I'll be bugging you about this until I'am satisfied you are mentally okay.” “You're not mentally okay. When was the last time you got a full nights sleep?”

Colt pointed a finger at me. “Don’t turn this around on me.” Finishing off my hot chocolate, I looked at his expression. He was trying not to smile and remain serious. “Colt.

I'm tired and ready to go to bed.” “Sis, you will never get rid of me.” This time, he did smile as he bend down and kissed my forehead. “Ill call you tomorrow.” He said to Alec and shook his hand.

“Late, man. Drive safe.” Alec walked him to the door. They exchanged a few words that I couldn’t hear but I was too tired and cold to care. &» Iwas setting my cup down when Alec walked back. He didn’t say anything as he gently got into the chair. I had to move a little so we were comfortable.

“I feel like I have improved from the

day you met me.” I.didn’t need to elaborate on what I was referring to. “You have.” [os That was it. You have? “Not going to say anything else?” I leaned away and looked at him. I was slightly hurt by this.

“I think you have made amazing strides in dealing with your emotions.

Honestly, you haven’t made me think once that you were still suffering from that trauma. I'm not going to lie and I wasn't waiting for it to come crashing down but maybe your subconscious is telling you that it’s something you still carry with you.” Alec rested his head on his hand and looked at the fire. He was battling with his emotions. There was some confusion, anger, concern but mostly

he was feeling hopeless. “You think I am suffering alone and not telling you?” Gm | “You wouldn’t be able to hide that from me.” Alec didn’t even look at me as he talked. He stared into the fire. “I would know if you were suffering. No, I just can’t get the images of you. More than onces I have sat beside you ina hosptial bed. You were on the brink of dying, covered in blood and bruises. I can’t do that again. I need you here.

Adalynn needs you.” @» I'wasn’t sure what to say so I just laid my head down and watched the fire.










###Chapter 0546 

As I stood in the shower, alone, flashes of last night flashed in my mind. At some point, I had fallen asleep on the chair. Alec had carried me to our room, removed my boot and cuddled against me as I slept.

However, this morning, I woke up to his side of the bed, empty.

It was still dark, I checked on Adalynn who was sleeping still and the fresh footprints leading away from the front door told me he must have gone for a run. If he wasn’t back by the time I got out of the shower, I was going to mind-link him.

Still, Iwasn’t convinced I had any repressed trauma floating around in my head. However, seeing how much

Alec was suffering as he watched me heal time and time after again. It made me realize that it wouldn’t hurt to be extra careful. My life isn’t just my life anymore and as much as I wanted to be carefree to have a risk free life, it may not be that way.

The hot water felt good but Adalynn was going to be awake soon. Stepping out, I wrapped a towel around me and walked to my closet. Since I was going to be working in my shop today, I picked out a thick pair of leggins and a long dresser sweater. That would be easy to wear my boot with. Still feeling alittle cold, I picked some fluffy socks out to match. Wanting to look a little more presentable, I added some makeup and did my hair. I was getting really good at curling my hair. Adalynn started crying right as I was finishing

putting hairspray on.

“Hey baby girl.” I cooed as I went into her room. She reached out for me. My heart physically ached as I thought about not being able to do this again. It was too the point that I had water in my eyes as I changed her diaper and carried her to the high chair.

Unfortunately for me, Alec got home as I'was wiping my eyes. “Are you okay?” “Yeah. I just was thinking about everything you said last night and when I went to get her, I just couldn’t help but thinking if I died, I wouldn’t get to ever see this little girl grow up.” Alec came over to me. He was wearing a sweater and sweat pants but he still felt cold from being outside. “I'm

sorry. I didn’t mean to put all that on you.” “This can’t be a one sided relationship.

You can’t be worried about me that you can’t emotionally open up to me.” I pushed him away as I tried to dry my tears.

Adalynn was starting to cry as she wanted her breakfast. “Mommy’s cutting up a banana.” Alec went to comfort our daughter as I finished it up.

Taking the cutting board, I pushed all the bananas on her try. “There you go.” I said, smiling through the tears.

I started on her bottle as Alec watched me work. “How are you feeling?” Glancing at him, I had a sarcastic noveldrama

remark that I couldn’t hold back from.

“Emotionally, physically or sexually?” Alec rolled his eyes at me but couldn’t help smirk at me. “Physically.” “I’m still cold but okay. Ankle isn’t too bad but still really sore. Should be better by tomorrow.” I pulled up my sleeves. “These bruises are already looking like they are healing.” My forearms were basically all yellow at this point.

“Emotionally?” Alec asked as I put my sleeves back down.

Setting the bottle down on Adalynn’s tray, I leaned against the counter and looked at him. “I don’t know. What you said really got to me. I guess I have some thinking to do.”

Alec just nodded in response. He looked at Adalynn for awhile and back at me. There just felt like there was this space between us and I didn’t like it.

“Why are you feeling... almost broken hearted?” Looking down, I went to the sink and started loading the dishwasher. “I guess I feel like there is this disconnect between us now. I don’t like it.” Alec move to come closer to me but the door bell rang. “Damit.” Alec muttered as he went to answer it.

Truthfully, I was a little relieved as I was about done talking about my emotions but I didn’t like feeling like Alec and I were on two separate planes.

Thad just finished cleaning when | Vivian and Alec walked in.

“Good Morning!” She was all smiles

today and Adalynn started screaming in delight.

“Good morning. I need to run but I am going to try to be back early today to spend some quality time with Adalynn.

Give you the evening off.” I gave her the best smile I could muster right now.

“You don’t have to do that but I guess after the day you had yesterday, good quality family time is what is most important. Nothing is more important than family. I'm so glad to have an alpha and luna that have such a great relationship that they always put each other’s needs first and now their daughter.” Vivian grabbed a wash cloth and started cleaning Adalynn up.

Alec and I just looked at each other for a moment, not saying anything. It

seemed like forever until I took a deep breath and put on a fake smile. “I love you little girl.” I said with all the emotion I could give. Feeling like I might cry again, I quickly kissed her on the cheek and waved

goodbye before darting into the garage.

Grabbing the car keys and my coat, I got in and started her up. The garage door opened, allowing me to pull out and head to my shop. Thankfully, the roads were bad but I still drove slow as I needed the time alone. So much for what little makeup I did as I just allowed the tears to flow down my face.

Maybe I did need this.











###Chapter 0547 

It’s been five minutes that I have been sitting in my car, trying to make my face look like I haven't just bawled my eyes out. After fanning my face, I even looked for extra make up in my purse to see if I could fix it.

My phone buzzed in the cup holder.

Reaching down, I looked at who send me a message.

Alec: Nothing will ever come between us. I' love you more than anything. I'm just scared to lose you.

I had to blink away more tears as what he said really touched my heart. I had a few different responses typed out but | finally decided on what I wanted to say.

Me: I'm a lot of things but my priority will always be you and Adalynn. Maybe you can take the afternoon off and.

spend it with Adalynn and 1? Getting out of the car, the cold wind hit me in the face, making me wish I just stayed home today. It was a quick jog inside and the warmth of the heater was welcoming.

“Hey, Luna!” Calvin was cleaning the floors.

“Hey! You are early.” I said as I checked my watch.

“Yeah, I was nervous so I got here a little early to make sure everything was ready to go.” Calvin rubbed the back of his neck as he looked around.

“I'm going to set my stuff down and I'll be at the desk if you need

anything.” I yelled as I walked into my office. My phone buzzed in my hand.


Alec: That would be great. Maybe we both can think about what we need to say and we can reconnect. I don’t want you feeling this way.

Me: reconnect... sexually??? I'was smiling as I set my phone down and took my jacket off. I didn’t have to wait long for his response.

Alec: Kristen...

I could just picture him rolling his eyes at me, but who was Iif I didn’t throw in some sarcastic remarks.

Me: I don’t want to feel this way anymore. It was painful to just look at you and feel like you were at am arms length away. Like we were on the verge noveldrama

of breaking up. @» My finger hovered over that message for a few minutes as my heart raced, - That was me being vulnerable and opening up. Finally, I hit send and went to the front desk.

“I'heard you were in an attack yesterday. How’s the ankle?” Calvin asked as he put the broom away.

“It’s getting there.” I didn’t say anything else because my phone buzzed again.

Alec: Nothing in this world would ever make us break up. This isn’t something we can’t figure out. You are mine.

A few seconds later, another message popped up.

Alec: I'll remind you later how much you are mine.

Me: Yes, Daddy Alec: woman... a I set my phone down as my other two employees walked in. “Good morning, Luna!” Brittany said and waved.


“Hey, Luna.” Tom nodded as he walked in.

It wasn’t soon after that my clients came in and my staff got to work.

Everything was going smoothly. By the time Emmy walked in with luna, I had balanced the check book and was adjusting the advertisements, “I came with food!” She held up a plastic bag and to go containers, “What did you bring me?” 1 asked as we went into my office. I shut the door but I took the office phone with me.

“Open face beef sandwich.” She pulled out the container and steam was literally seeping out of it. i f “You are amazing.” I said as I took it and set it on my desk. Emmy sat in the second chair that Alec added for when he was there.

“Tknow. You honestly don’t tell me enough.” Ijust rolled my eyes at her. “Can I ask you something?” I said after a few minutes of us silently eating.

“Sure?” Emmy looked at me confused.

“Do you feel like I have emotionally grown since I first mated Alec?” Emmy’s body froze for a second as she reached for her water. “I mean...” She |

took a sip before answering.

“Yes and no. You still use sarcasm to i hide your feeling some times but you do seem more in tune to them. Like you are more open with physical contact and telling people you love them.” “Oh.” I wasn’t sure what I was expecting or wanted her to say.

“However, the sarcasm is just you. If you didn’t do that, I would think something is wrong. Did something happen?” “Just more of what we talked about last night. Alec said he can’t handle if I get hurt again, like I need to be more aware of situations and not put myself in harms way.” “He said that?” Emmy looked shocked.

“Yes and no. Not all of it but that is what I took from in.” “If you put yourself in his shoes, how would you feel?” She paused as I took another bite. “How would you feel if you watched him get kidnapped...

twice... and beaten up, touched sexually and basically dead multiple times. I think he is struggling emotionally and doesn’t want to tell you because he is afraid you can’t handle it.” “Can’t handle it?” “Maybe that was a bad choice of words.

More like he doesn’t want to put more stress on you when you are healing. He isn’t able to open up to you or he is scared to open up to you.” Looking down, I lost my appetite. That is what he literally did. He opened up to

me and I ran away crying. “Yeah.” “However, if you didn’t do what you | did, a lot of people might have died and it’s not like you sought out our crash yesterday. Trouble just finds you.” Emmy seemed clueless to my demeanor.

“Is that why we are friends. You are the trouble.” “Am I the drama?” Emmy put her hand over her heart and faked being hurt.











###Chapter 0548 

A knock on my office door interrupted Emmy and I laughing. “It’s open!” I yelled. Colt and Alec were both standing at the doorway as we were wiping the tears of laughter away.

“How’s it going?” I asked as we stepped out since my office was too small for the four of us. Thankfully, the last of my employees left to go on their lunch break so we were alone.

“Just came to check on you. Why are you girls crying?” Colt looked at us like we were crazy.

I shook my head. To an outsider, it would seem stupid. “Do you really want to know what Emmy and I talk about in private?” Putting my food down, I didn’t miss Alec frowning at

the little amount I ate.

“No. I'don’t. I just wanted to checkon { you and see how you were feeling.” Colt checked his watch.

“Sore but I am getting there. I am actually finishing up lunch and then I am going to go home and spend the say with my girl.” Colt looked surprised but smiled.

“Good. Rest will do you some good.” “So they say.” “I got to go. I'll text you later.” Emmy tossed her food away and started walking out. “See you boys later!” “Thank you for lunch!” I'yelled as she walked out the door. She waved goodbye to let me know she heard me.

“Really, Kristen. How are you?” Colt leaned forward and got closer.

“Wow, full name and everything.” Sighing, I tossed my food away and stood up. “I’m not going to figure it out in twelve hours. You are going to have to give me some time to figure it out. However, I thought I was fine and didn’t have an issue so I'm still not sure what to say. I’m going to have to do a lot of self reflection and thinking.” I raised my shoulders and dropped them.


“I’m just worried about you.” “1 understand that. I really do but you are acting like I caused yesterday to happen to myself. I didn’t seek outa fight. I was literally driving home and they pushed me over the edge. I was hit from the side and we fell down the hill,

landed in the water. I didn’t jump on the ice to break it. I was just keeping us alive until you guys came for me. I’m-a little annoyed that you are acting like I did this to myself. It wasn’t like last time where I asked them to take me so he didn’t kill Alec.” I gave him a look and walked over to make sure the sterilization was going and all the lights were off. Satisfied the shop was good to go, I went back to the boys. “I'm just.... you have been so happy. If this turns out to be something...” Colt shook his head not sure of what to say. “I don’t want to see you go back to how you were before.” “All things considered, I thought held it together nicely.” “you held it together by pushing all

your feelings down and ignoring them.

That isn’t healthy.” Colt shot back at me.

“I’m not the same person as I was before. I know it was six months ago but damn, give me some credit. Tam a highly intelligent person.” “That can’t admit when she needs emotional help.” Colt leaned back and whispered.

“you got the heart and I got the brains.” Patting him on the shoulder, I went and grabbed my coat and purse.

“Whatever.” Colt sighed but smiled at me. “Love you.” He said as he grabbed my shoulders.

“I love you too.” I said easily. “See? I can say it now!” Giving him a told-

you-so look, he just rolled his eyes and pulled me into a hug.

Letting me go, he walked to the door.

“Talk to you guys later.” Only after he was gone did Alec say anything. “Your color looks better.” “Does it? I still can’t shake this cold feeling.” I shivered a little and put on my coat.

“I’m all done for the day. I was thinking we could go for a drive before we go home?” I was a little surprised. The roads weren't the best but I did want the alone time with him. “Sounds good.” Neither of us spoke as he drove us.

After we passed the turn off to Colt’s

pack, I had an idea of where we were going. It’s where everything started.

“We had our first date here.” Alec said as he pulled into the empty drive in movie theater.

“We did. You were all pissy when we left. I thought you were mad at me.” I looked at him and laughed. Alec parked the car but let it idle for the heat.

«wasn’t mad at you.” Alec looked out the window but didn’t say anything else.

There was this uncomfortable silence as I tried to get the courage to talk. I knew Alec was waiting because his eyes kept looking at my fidgeting fingers. noveldrama

“Emmy told me to put myself in your shoes. If I watched you get hurt like | have been, how would I feel.”

Alec nodded. “And?” “I understand why you feel that way.” “But?” Alec didn’t try to touch me, just looked out the window.

“Half of it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t decide to fall into the water. The wolves attacked me when I was driving home. I couldn’t help being kidnapped.

I know once I told them to take me but they were going to kill you. Fuck, he killed your dad. I'm not going out of my way to get hurt and I'm struggling trying to figure out what you wanted me to do in those situations. I fought back to stay alive. The only thing going through my mind during those times was what I needed to do to stay alive till you came for me. It was your face that I kept thinking of to keep me

| motivated to live.”








###Chapter 0549 

Alec didn’t say anything for awhile, He just stared out of the window and battled with his own feelings. “Come here.” He reached over and pulled me on his lap. Due to my boot, my legs stayed over the center console but he wrapped his arms around me. “If anything happens to you....” Alec rested his head on mine. He couldn’t get the words out of his mouth.

“I’m too stubborn to die. The Moon Goddess would probably get tired of my mouth and pushed me back down here.” “Not funny.” Alec grumbled but I felt a little humor come from him.

“I know my sarcasm can be frustrating but it’s a coping mechanism. I can’t

change who I am but I will try to not find myself in dangerous situations. 1 promise to talk to you about my | feelings and work through them.” Alec picked his head up and tilted my head back. His eyes searched my face like he was trying to memorizing it. His hands traced my hairline down to my lips. “You are my everything. Don’t be surprised when I start requiring more safety measures. Danger has a way of finding you.” “Still, none of it way my fault. You have to admit it.” I pushed.

Alec rolled his eyes. “I'll give you 75%” “What?” I was trying not to laugh.

“What did I do that was my fault?” “Should have killed both of those

wolves quicker.” My jaw dropped open. “That is a direct reflection of your lack of training.” “You have been pregnant and then had anew born. Though, I do think it’s time you get back in there.” Alec cupped my head and just held me.

I opened my mouth to speak but Alec’s phone rang. As much as he didn’t want to answer it, it was Colt so he did.

“Yeah?” He put it on speaker phone. noveldrama

“Is Ice with you?” Colt asked.

“I’m here, what’s up?” “There was a rogue attack at ~~ Anthony’s pack. His mate was killed.” Alec looked up at me. I didn’t need to


feel his emotions to know how he felt from just looking in his eyes. “Fuck.” “Is there a funeral?” I asked.

“They already had it. I guess the attack happened two nights ago.” “Two nights ago? Seriously?” I looked down at the phone. “Why are we just now hearing about this?” “Your attack was last night. The attack on my pack was just random at that point. Now that another pack has been attacked, this might just be an increase of rogue.” “But those weren’t rogues that attacked me.” I was getting annoyed no one believed me.

“They could have only been rogues for a few weeks. The smell might not have

set in at that point.” Colt sighed.

“Regardless, that isn’t all I have to tell you.” “What else?” I said with an attitude.

“I guess he was about to die so he marked a member of his pack. She wants to have a luna ceremony tomorrow.” “Are you serious?” Alec asked. Both of us were completely surprised.

“I think he didn’t want to risk dying and he doesn’t have a kid.” Colt sounded like he was miles away.

“Who did he mark?” Alec asked after a moment of silence.

“No idea. I just got a call from Jace who heard it form Lars who heard it form Hank and so forth.” Colt yelled at one 5/0

of his warriors. “Listen, I got to £0 but I'll call back later. We can fly together, It will be easier to take the helicopter.” “Okay.” I said about a second before Colt hung up.

“Would you take another mate that quickly?” I asked Alec.


“Nope, I would be dead with in minutes. If you leave, I leave.” “What about Adalynn?” I asked, a little surprised.

“She will be old enough to take over the pack so it won’t matter.” Alec leaned down and placed a gentle kiss to my lips. It was a comfort kind of kiss that was showed me how much he loved me.

“Is that so?” I asked after he stopped

Kissing me.

“Yes.” | [couldn’t help but smile as I looked into his eyes. “Are we okay?” “We were never not okay. We just got to find a better way of working out our emotions.” Alec took a deep breath and let me get back over to my eat.

“What is life without a little excitement?” I laughed as Alec put the car in reverse but stopped and looked at me. “It was a joke!” “The only excitement I need is in the bedroom.” “Is that so?” Challenge excepted. As much as I could with my boot, I moved so I could pop his dick out and started sucking. The surprise Alec felt was almost amusing. It had been months

since I did this last and he was loving it. Pushing on the brakes, he slowed the car down as we made our way. | home.

“Fuck, woman.” Alec moaned as he finished.

Leaning back, I got the pleasure of watching his eyes roll forward as he put his dick away. “Yes?” I asked slowly as I finished cleaning off my lips.

“If this is what I get, we should have more car dates.” Alec smirked at me and reached over to grab my hand. We were pulling into our house so it wasn’t like we could slip away to another place.

“Is that so?” Lifting an eyebrow at him, I just had to laugh at how happy he was feeling. Is that all he needed

was some sappy talk and then a blow job to feel happy? “Yes, ma'am.” “Well, it’s too bad we are taking a helicopter ride tomorrow with my brother. Can’t join the mile high club that way.” I teased as we got out of the car.

“Well, we still could...” Alec started but I quickly slapped him on the arm.

“Gross.” I rolled my eyes as I walked faster but Alec just slapped me hard on the ass as I walked through the door.








###Chapter 0550 

| “How’s my little girl?” I said as we walked up the stairs to the loft.

Adalynn clapped her hands together and reached for me. As soon as I picked her up, she gave me a hug before her eyes landed on Alec. Almost immediatly, she ditched me and reached out to him.

“My little girl.” Alec said with a laugh.

“Fucking bullshit.” I said under my breath. “Thank you for watching her. noveldrama

We just got a call and another Alpha is having a luna ceremony tomorrow.

Would you be able to watch her tomorrow and stay tomorrow night? I'm not sure when we will get home.”

“Of course!” Vivian stood up and smiled at me. “I'll get out of your hair so you guys can spend the evening asa family but I'll be back first thing tomorrow!” “You are truly a life saver.” I told her as she walked down the stairs.

“Just add it to my Christmas bonus!” Vivian laughed as she went to the front door.

“She deserves a big bonus.” Alec said in a baby voice as he sat down with Adalynn to keep playing with her toys.

The front door opened and closed so 1 knew Vivian had left. “She really does.” Laying down on the other side, I could feel Alec looking at me. “Yes?” I asked without looking at him.

“When are we going to have another one?” “As soon as you figure out who these attacks are from.” “It could be nothing, let’s have another.” Alec looked at Adalynn and started tickling her.

“Once you turn down the difficulty setting on my life, then we can.” It was hard to not roll my eyes and smile at the same time.

“you're so good at multitasking though. I'm sure we can handle it.

Vivian is amazing.” Alec picked Adalynn up and held her against his face so I could see both of them stick their lips out. Alec was pleading and Adalynn was crying.

“I am great a multitasking. Look at me.

I am chilling and not losing my mind right now! Why change that?” “TI know, mommy is no fun.” Alec turned Adalynn around and comforted her.

Laying on my back, I was struggling with the boot. “I can’t decide if I need an XL coffee, snuggles, eight shots of vodka, 842 chicken nuggets or two months of sleep.” “That is quite the list.” Alec laughed at me but he laid down with me on the floor. Adalynn was standing on his stomach. She was using him as a trampoline.

“My mind is an amazing thing.” I couldn’t help but laugh.

“It truly is.” “How many kids do you want? We are

getting old.” Tlooked over at him. He was making faces at Adalynn, making her laugh.

“We aren’t old!” “I’ve come to the conclusion that I'm never going to have a mid-life crisis because I have fit any and all crisis in this last year.” “You’re not wrong. That’s why we can have half a dozen kids.” Alec took Adalynn and rolled over so she fell on my stomach. “Get mommy!” Adalynn kept trying to bounce but she was on my tits and that hurt.

“Too bad we didn’t have triplets like Colt and Penny.” Rolling to the side, Adalynn was sandwiched between us as she chewed on her toys.

“As much as I want more kids, [ am good with some spaces between them.” Adalynn tossed down her toy and started patting her belly. “Is my baby girl hungry?” I asked as I tried to give her a hug but she went to her dad.

“My daddy’s girl.” Alec scooped her up as he stood up in the process.

“Next one needs to be a boy so he wants me, not you.” Alec reached out her hand so I could have some help up. “No kid will ever want you as much as I do.” Alec muttered in my ear as we walked down the stairs.

“Eat’cha heart out.” Looking back, I bit my lip. His eyes went straight there and he had to adjust himself as he put

Adalynn in her highchair.

“Just might.” I was bent over, looking in the fridge so it was too easy for him to graze the inside of my thighs.

“Keep that up and Adalynn will have an early bedtime.” “She is six months old, she won’t know.” Alec put his hands on my hips as I laid out some fruit and pieces of chicken to cut up. “Someone is horny.” On purpose, I shoved my ass back into him.

His claws dug into my hips as I purposely twisted my body as I cut up.

The arousal was filling him up as he put his head on my shoulder. His tongue traced down my neck.

Right as my head rolled back, Adalynn

started screaming because I was taking too long to get her room. At the same time, the door bell rang. SS “Fucking bullshit.” Alec muttered.

Wanting to make things worse for him, I turned around and put my arms on his shoulders, forcing him to look at me. Reaching down, I grabbed his dick.

“What I wouldn't give to feel you inside me.” Tossing my head back, the door bell rang again.

“Fucking tease.” Alec grabbed my tit and squeezed before he walked off, adjusting himself.

I couldn’t contain my laughter as I put the bananas on Adalynn’s tray.

“Hey, Ice.” Colt walked in with dress and a sexually frustrated Alec walking behind him.

“Hey bro, what’s up.” | “Just wanted to tell you we are leaving | tomorrow at eight. Pack a bag as we might be staying the night. Penny wanted me to give you this dress to wear. Apparently, Emmy called and said you needed one?” “Well, Emmy knows everything in my closet and if she believes I don’t have a dress for a luna ceremony, I must need one.” “Good. I didn’t waste a trip over here then.” Colt let the dress down on the table. “I got to go but be at the helicopter pad by 7:45am. I don’t know what is happening but I don’t want to be late.”








###Chapter 0551

 “Why am I so nervous for this?” | asked. We were driving to Colt’s pack.

“This whole situation is weird. I understand why he would take a mate minutes after he loses one but to have a luna ceremony this quickly?” Alec mirrored my unease about this.

“I haven’t even had a luna ceremony.” “That’s right. We should get on that.” Alec put his hand on my thigh. “I like this dress.” Penny gave me a wrap dress that was flowy to my mid-thigh. The whole thing was slightly frustrating to figure out. The term wrap was quite literal as

had to put it on like a robe and wrap it around me to tie it. However, what Alec didn’t know, I put a little something fun under it.

“What's the point? It’s been so long and so much has happened that it would just feel somewhat like a waste of money.” “Idon’t think so. You deserve one.” Alec pulled up to the helicopter pad at 7:37am. Not even Colt was here yet.

Since it was just the four of us going, I didn’t have to worry about anyone else being late.

“I’m surprised we are here first.” “Me too. How's the ankle?” Alec looked down at my heels. My ankle was still a little bruised but it felt normal.

“Ready to dance circles around you.” Leaning over, I grabbed his tie and pulled him towards me. The kiss I placed on his lips was to make sure he knew what we was going to get tonight.

Colt pulled up beside us as I finally let him go. “Didn’t get enough last night?” Alec straighten up his shirt as I started to get out.

Stepping out of the car, I leaned down at him. “I'll never get enough but since I can still walk today, I think you still have work to do.” Alec narrowed his eyes at me.

Laughing, I shut the door and headed towards the helicopter. “Hey!” Penny waved as they met us walking to the helicopter.


“That dress looks amazing on you!” “Thankyou! I'm not sure it's a winter dress but it does fit well.” “I'm sorry, all I got was it would be indoor and these functions are always so warm.” Colt opened the door for Penny to get in and then helped me climb in. After Alec got in, he got in and shut the door.

We all put our headsets on and buckled up.

“If you don’t mind, Colt is writing an article for the local paper about the bar.

Would you mind if I asked you some questions since you are co-owner?” Penny pulled out a pen and paper from her purse.

Her eyes looked hopeful so I didn’t feel

like I could turn her down. “well, technically Colt is the soul owner.” Alec leaned back and put his arm around me. His thumb was rubbing iny arm, trying to keep my nerves at bay.

We only had about an hour long flight so this would help pass the time.

However, I was never one for interviews.

“T’know but please?” Penny begged.

“Sure.” Penny let out a little squeak of excitement. “Perfect! Okay, first questions. It takes different skills to be able to open and manage a business.

How has owning this bar challenged you?” “I didn’t realize growing up meant

dying inside so I figured I might as well drink and have a good time at it.” Alec actually snorted in laughter, Colt choked on the water he was drinking and Penny gave me a very disapproving look.



“Kristen!” “Fine, let's see. Owning the bar and challenging me...” I had to think about this one. It really hasn’t been that challenging. “I guess learning to balance other obligations and the bar’s obligations.” “I think the most challenging thing for you was to teach your facial expression to use their inside voices.” Colt retorted.

“Oh yeah! I like that answer better.” Nodding quickly, Penny sighed deeply and Alec actually laughed.

“How would you say you learn the best?” Penny ignored us and kept going.

“The fucking hard way.” “I’m just going to make up answers for you.” Penny glared at me and put her pen and paper away.

“That might be best. Ice doesn’t exactly have the personality we would put in front of the cameras anyway.” Colt shook his head at me and pulled Penny next to him to comfort her.

“I'am a fucking delight and it’s all you fuckers that need to gain a sense of humor.” Crossing my arms, Alec was actually enjoying this.

“I honestly don’t know why I even asked. You haven't given a straight answer in years during an interview.”

Penny looked at her watch and looked out the window.

“You are the public perfect personalit- You are the type of person we would put in front of the camera to answer question the correct way and I am the person behind the scenes making all the decision. That is slightly inappropriate and has a loose mouth.” I tried to make her feel better. noveldrama

“You're not wrong.” Colt started fidgeting.

“Why are you restless?” I asked him.

Colt looked defensive. “What do you think I am restless?” “you keep moving. This whole thing is making you nervous too, huh?”

“Tjust don’t like it.” Penny looked up at Colt. “It just happened so fast.” She put her hand nn his leg. “I think it wouldn’t be so nerve racking if we would have went to a funeral or there would have been at least a month between her death and another luna ceremony. I know it’s not unheard of but damn.” “She was such a sweet lady too.” I said as the helicopter started dropping. “I hate this part.” Alec pulled me close as I tried to sit still. Each time it dropped, my stomach would go into my throat.

“It’s not that bad.” Colt looked at me amused.

My claws were literally digging into Alec, “We are literally falling out of the sky.”








###Chapter 0552 

Only when the helicopter touched down did I breath again. “Geez, Ice.

Someone might actually think you are capable of having emotions.” Colt poked fun at me as he opened the door.

Penny went first and then Alec. As I was about to leave, Alec held out his hands for me. He basically picked me up and gently put me down. I wasn’t sure at first why but when my feet hit the ground, they sank in. My ankle that was starting to heal bent a little, sending a shooting pain up my leg.

“Damn.” “Forgot how to walk in heels?” Colt asked as he laughed.

Alec was still holding me up and I was

struggling. “Penny is only standing because she isn’t wearing heels. You're shoes are sinking into the ground.” Glaring at him, Alec picked me to carry me to the car that was waiting.

Alec let me get in first before he climbed in. There were two bench seats facing each other so when Colt came in, my foot accidentally got in the way and made him trip. “Shit!” “Oh, sorry. Maybe if you weren't wearing clown shoes you could walk better.” “Is this how you two are going to behave today?” Penny looked at us like she was trying to scold us. Alec was thoroughly enjoying our bickering and Colt and I acted like we had no idea what she was talking about.

“I'haven’t seen my twin in ages. I just

love him.” She narrowed her eyes at me. “You saw him last night. Nice try.” “That was for business. I don’t get to see him for pleasure.” “Full of shit. Both of you!” Penny rolled her eyes at me. noveldrama

My mouth dropped open as I looked at Colt. “Did she just cuss at me?” Colt put his arm over her and tried to make her smile. “Come on. We are just having some fun.” The car came to a stop in front of

some sort of event center. Since we haven't been there before, Colt and I stopped bickering and got out of the car. There was multiple people filing in so we started walking too.

Alec put his hand on my lower back as we walked in front of Colt and Penny.

There was men in suites holding the door open for people. Soft piano music was playing as we walked in. White and red flowers filled the main room with spandex table coverings. Before fulling walking in, there was a table with our names for us to find our assigned seating.


“Table one?” Colt said as he found our names. He showed me the card to make sure I saw the same thing he did.

“Yeah...” As we walked in, the round tables had enough room for eight people so there would be at least four other people that were sitting with us. The closer we got, I was able to see that Jace and Lars were also at table one with their mates.

“Hey!” I said with a smile as we approached. h “Good to see you guys!” Jace stood up and so did his mate, Echo.

Lars and Emily weren't far behind. As soon as we gave everyone hugs and said hello, we sat down. For some reason, my legs kept bouncing to the point that Alec put his hand on them to keep them still. Colt was sitting on my other side so Penny could sit next to Echo. They had formed a good friendship recently.

“What an occasion, huh?” Jace started as a waiter came around.

“Can I get anyone anything to drink?” “I think just waters would be fine.”

Colt answered as he looked around for anyone to say anything else.

“Right away, Alpha Colt.” He bowed and retreated.

“This is defiantly quite the set up in such a short time.” Emily said quietly.

“He needs an heir, I guess.” Echo whispered.

“Kristen, I am so excited for the party this weekend!” Emily changed the subject as the waiter came back around.

“Me too! We will have so much fun!” Leaning forward, I took a sip from the water before sitting it down.

“We are suppose to get some more snow so it will really go well with the

decorations.” Penny joined in.


“Look who it is!” Lars smiled and { looked behind Alec.

“Am I last to the party?” Carson had a smile on his face as he walked up with Molly. Hank and Skyler were right behind him.

“Still waiting on Aston and Kathryn.” Jace said as the guys stood up to shake his hand.

“Has anyone met his new luna?” Hank asked.

“We haven’t.” Jace said and looked around.

“Nope.” Colt said. “We weren't told anything.” “Us either. This should be interesting.” Carson sighed as he looked around. It

looked like the whole pack was here.

“Look who it is.” Jace whispered. We all turned to see Aston, Kathryn and Anthony walking up the aisle.

“Thank you all for coming on such short notice.” Anthony said as he shook everyone’s hand.

“I’m sorry for you loss but excited to meet your new luna.” I said politely.

“Thank you. It has defiantly been a whirlwind of emotions.” Anthony didn’t appear to be very broken hearted. His face said he was sad but his eyes held something else.

“You sure did put something together quickly. These are beautiful flowers.” Emily said to Anthony as I started

looking around at the other guest.

Many were whispering quietly and others sitting quietly. However, no one was smiling. The entire mood was...

tension. People were sitting on the edge of their seats, and just looking rather anxious.

The conversation with Anthony drifted into the background as I looked at the staff and just everyone. Someone was getting yelled at in the kitchen. I | couldn’t hear it all but I caught words like perfect and lazy.

“If you excuse me, I think it is time to start.” Alec nudged me so I would focus and sit down. The lights dimmed and everyone stood for the new luna to walk down the aisle.











###Chapter 0553 ‘

The room stood up but the only person smiling was Anthony. Whoever it was, they were taking their sweet time.

Since I was a whole head shorter than the boys, 1 wasn’t able to see her until she was next to us.

Alec and Colt both tensed up as she came into view for them. Alec even reached around and put his arm around me, holding me extremely tightly against him. I was about to ask him why when I finally saw her.

Ann was walking down the aisle in a white dress. Her hair was neatly pulled back into a classic bun with huge diamond earrings. Her eyes never left Anthony as she walked past us.

My body was frozen. I was aware of

people looking at me but I couldn't focus. How the hell was Ann here? Colt told me she died! She was burned.

When everyone sat down, Alec had to pull me down so I wasn’t the only person standing. noveldrama

I'was like my body wasn’t my own. My breathing got heavy, my chest started to hurt and the room was spinning.

“Kristen, breathe.” Alec whispered in my ear. He all but put me on his lap.

His hands weren’t up and down my arm and he pushed calming emotions into me.

Closing my eyes, I tried to focus on my breathing. As hard as it was, I was able to halfway control it. Alec kept whispering in my ear. Since my head fell on his shoulder, it was easy to make it look like we were just hugging.


a colle conban “Colt?” I heard the anger in Alec's voice as he whispered.

“Idon’t know.” It sounded like Colt had just as much restraint in his voice as Alec did.

Finally, I felt like I was breath. Leaning back, I looked over at Colt. He was looking at me, almost waiting for something. “You said she was dead.” Colt didn’t answer but his wolf flashed in his eyes. Penny was doing everything in her power to keep Colt calm. As I looked around, Jace and Lars were looking just as angry. Their mates were looking at me with so much sympathy that it made me choke up.

Everyone started clapping, making me look up. The ceremony was over and

they were standing there, holding hands. Ann was sporting a new mark on her neck that felt like daggers tomy heart.

“I would like to thank everyone for coming today. It was short notice but we felt like it was the right time. I would like to take this time to clear the air. Carol, rest her soul, was my chosen mate. After all these years, I was able to finally take my fated mate and how it was fated. At the untimely death of Carol, I would run into my fated mate. I know this is sudden for some people but I think you will find Luna Ann to be a warm and welcoming person. There will be a meal and a dance after! Please enjoy yourself!” There was a small clapping as they walked down the aisle. Ann looked right at me and smiled as they passed.

As soon as they were out of ear shot, the questions started. “Is that who | think it was?” Lars leaned forward and looked at Colt.

“Colt!” Alec grumbled.

“I don’t fucking know! I saw her body.

The face was not recognizable but it was the right cell.” My mind was racing. “Didn’t Anthony walked around your pack at one point?” I asked in a whisper.

“y-yeah?” Colt didn’t seem that sure.

“What if he found the cells and put a woman in there and snuck Ann out.


What if the rogues were his so he could get Ann?” I tried pieces together different options.

“No. That would mean Anthony is a

traitor.” Jace shook his head.

“We will no long be allies with him.” Alec was fucking pissed. “I am officially cutting ties.” “Me too.” Colt agreed quickly. “I'm sorry, Ice. I didn’t even question if it was Ann. The body was in pieces.” I was numb. I wasn’t sure what to feel or what to think. “It is your turn to get food.” A waiter came up to us and announced for us to get food.

Slowly, everyone stood up. Grabbing Alec’s hand, I held on for my dear life.

“See, I am emotionally needy.” I said sarcastically in our mind-link.

He looked down at me and rolled his eyes but he pulled me against him as we waited in line. He had to let go so he could hand me a plate. Instead of

waiting for me to get food, Alec just put alittle of everything on my plate.

When we were finished, he took both plates and walked behind me as I made our way back to our table. “Try and eat.” Alec muttered. We were the only ones here at the moment.

“How long do we have to stay?” 1 asked. He looked at me. “I’m going to have to push all these feelings away to be able to handle this.” wanted to warn him. I didn’t want to just do it and make it seem like I am not addressing my feelings.

“Put on a brave face so she doesn’t know she got to you but do not pus them away. We will address them later in private but be strong now.” Alec leaned down and kissed my forehead.

“I love you. We will figure this out.” He

whispered as Jace and Emily sat down € “We will stand with you.” Jace whispered as he looked around to make sure he wasn’t being over heard.

“Thank you.” Alec pulled his arm out from around me to shake Jace’s hand.

“I know Lars will follow and by the looks of Carson and Hank, we might be united.” “I’m not sure about Aston.” Alec said and nodded over. We looked over to see Aston and Anthony shake hands.












###Chapter 0554 

As the music started up, people were moving the tables around so the dance floor could be larger than the little square that was open. This causes us to move to one of the standing tables against the wall. Which, I was perfectly fine with. Alec had pushed me against the wall and I was more or less sandwiched between all the alphas.

Every Luna had followed my lead and kept their backs to the wall. However, standing was really starting to hurt my ankle.

“1s there a side room we can slip into for a private meeting?” Jace leaned over and asked Colt.

«pl check.” Lars gave Emily anod before he walked quickly and elegantly

out of the main room. Emily sighed but her back straightened as she watched him leave. ic» | “He will be okay.” I whispered to her.

Emily looked at me and gave me a small smile. “I know. After hearing what Ann did to you, I just am really uncomfortable.” “Me too.” I said as Alec looked back at me. His eyes looked down at my ankle before he turned around. He was quietly talking to Colt but they weren’t taking their eyes off Ann.

Emily reached out and tapped Alec on the shoulder. As soon as he made eye contact with him, she motioned him to come closer. “Lars found a room. He wants us to go to him. Go out the doors and to the left. Just a ways down”

Alec nodded and leaned back to Colt. noveldrama

After the message got passed around, we started filing out. Alec wrapped his arm around my waist and then gently took Emily by the arm. We went before Colt and Penny. Jace and Echo were the last.

Emily was guiding us down the hall.

She was moving so fast that I almost had to run. Still, Alec didn’t let her go until he passed her off to Lars.

I briefly caught the, ‘thank you’ Lars said before Alec pushed me in the room. Moving to the center, Alec pulled up a chair and forced me to sit down.

As everyone gathered around, he bent down and started examining it. I haven’t looked at it yet so when I saw the swelling, I was a little concerned.

“Did she re-break it?” Colt asked.


“Think so. It must not have been fully | healed and when you rolled it, it made it flare up.” Carefully, Alec took off my heels before he stood up.

“I want to leave.” I said firmly as I looked up at Colt and Alec.

“We will be. Very soon.” Colt’s wolf flashed before his eyes.

“What the fuck?” Alec growled at Colt.

It was enough that all the Luna’s backed away. Carson and Hank stepped in.

“Whoa!” Carson looked between them.

“I don’t know man! Her body was in pieces! Don’t forget who I am. I'm just as upset as you. Do you honestly think I would lie about that!” Colt puffed up as

he was pissed off from Alec’s aggression.

“Alec.” 1 said, softly. Reaching out, I took his hand in mine. “You know as well as I do that Colt wouldn’t do that.” I said in the mind-link. I have sent going to call him out.

“What is happening?” Jace asked.

Alec and Colt just looked at each other.

So, I answered the question. “Ann was in Colt’s cells. After dad... when Colt took over, he put her in the cells and she was suppose to spend the last of her days there. When we had that rogue attack, they got into the cells. A female body was torn up and we assumed it was Ann. It was the right cell. They burned her and everything.

Now, Ann shows up here. Anthony had to of gotten her out and put another

woman there. He has to be behind all this.” “This got messy.” Lars shook his head.


“We good?” Carson asked as he slapped Alec on the chest.

“Fine.” Alec shook Carson off and walked away. He put his hand on top of his head and took a moment to himself.

“How did you break your ankle?” Hank asked.

I opened my mouth to speak but Colt beat me to it. “Her jeep was attacked. It appeared to be rogues but Ice swears it wasn’t and now I’m inclined to agree.” “She almost fucking died!” Alec

growled. “I'm going to kill them.” Sighing, I got up and limped over to | him. Wrapping my arms around him, I felt him start to relax. “But I didn’t die.

We will figure this out the same way we did before.” It took a few more minutes but he finally calmed down and we walked back over to the group. They were watching us the whole time so it felt like they invaded our privacy a little.

Before I could sit down, the door opened.

“There you guys are!” Anthony walked in, with Ann on his arm.

“A family reunion.” She smirked.

Colt walked around to stand on the other side of me and Emily moved all the other Luna’s to the back. It was

literally Carson, Hank, Jace, Lars, Colt, Alec and me against him. “You have some explaining to do.” I said -__ instantly. No way in hell was I going to be silenced.

“You haven't figured it out yet? I thought you were a genius or something.” Anthony laughed as Aston and Kathryn walked in the room. He stood beside Anthony but Kathryn looked worried.

“T just want to hear how you betrayed us from your own lips.” My wolf was making her appearance now.

“Let’s cut to the chase, we are mates and marked. There isn’t anything you can do to her.... Or me.” “We are officially cutting ties with you.” Alec said with impressive restraint.

“Me too.” Colt said.

“Actually, we all are cutting ties. What a disgrace.” Hank shook his head.

“We assumed so. However, we don’t need your alliance anyways.” Anthony shrugged.

Penny walked up to Colt. “We are leaving.” “I don’t want you bring down my party. We were going to kick you out anyways. However, you will be hearing from us soon.” Ann looked me up and down before she turned her back to us and walked out.









###Chapter 0555 

None of us moved for a moment.

Trying to wrap our heads around what just happened. He wasn’t even trying to hide the fact he intentionally stabbed all of us in the back. He literally brought us here to say fuck you and watch out.

“We need to have a meeting.” Carson said instantly.

“Come to my house. We have the space and I don’t want Kristen traveling.” Alec looked down at me. His emotions were everywhere but he held it together.

“Alright. We will meet you there.” Hank nodded.

Colt reached down and grabbed my

shoes and Alec picked me up. “I can walk.” Raising my eyebrow at him, he just rolled his eyes at me and kept going. However, I was happy for the ride.

All of us headed out as quickly as we could, before anything could happen.

Colt must have mind-link ahead, because the helicopter was already started and ready to go.

Colt ran ahead and got Penny inside before he helped me get inside. After Alec climbed in next to me, Colt got in and shut the door. “Go!” He commanded.

As much as I hated flying, I'looked down at the center, just in time to see Anthony and Ann walk out. Since they were looking up, I reached over and flipped them the bird before the

helicopter dipped and flew off.

“What are you doing?” Penny asked ; confused.


“Anthony and Ann were watching us.” Sitting back, my head rested against Alec.

“So you...flipped them off?” Penny giggled but neither boy looked amused.

I couldn’t find a good position to put my ankle so I eventually draped it across Alec’s lap. “That looks painful.” Penny was looking closely at it.

“P11 put some ice on it and elevate it.” “you will wear your boot tomorrow.” Alec didn’t even look at me.

“How are you not as upset as theynoveldrama

are?” Penny asked me.

Colt’s head snapped to me. The way his eyes narrowed made me feel a little uneasy. “You better not have. We talked about this.” “I did what I needed to do so I didn’t have a full blown panic attack!” I couldn’t help but to yell.

“please tell me you are going to work through them?” Colt pinched the bridge of his nose.

“with Alec now leave me alone.” Crossing my arms, I looked away from him.

It was awhile before anyone spoke after that. We all listened to the sounds of the helicopter flying through the air.

“Ice... I'm sorry.” Colt leaned forward

and looked at me.

“Okay.” I still didn’t want to look at him. If I let those feelings in, I wasn’t sure what was going to happen. Either way, I wasn’t going to find outina helicopter.


“I’m serious.” Colt reached out and pushed my leg. “Look at me.” I looked at him but didn’t speak.

Instead I just raised an eyebrow at him, waiting for him to talk. Still, just looking into Colt’s eyes, I could see how sorry he was and how much he wanted me to be okay. It was maddening but as hard as I pushed from him, he pushed back. After awhile, I gave in. “ Fine.” “Thank you.” Colt said and leaned back.

“you literally didn’t say anything.” penny was looking between us with her mouth open. = “]'m with Penny.” Alec grumbled.

“He just wants me to work through my feelings and be okay. He said we would figure this out and she wasn’t going to get tome.” «and that I loved her.” Colt added. We both looked out the window. I could see Alec and Penny share a look of confusion.

After what seemed like hours, the helicopter finally started to dramatically land. Holding into Alec’s arm, I just buried my face. “I'm never riding this again.” It was all I could do to not throw myself out of the plane as it landed.

“Drive carefully. We are going to change and head your way.” Colt said and stuck his hand out to Alec. — Without hesitation, Alec shook his hand. “Sounds good.” As I went to walk to the car, Alec came up behind me and picked me up. “My savor.” I whispered in his ear.

“1’11 always be here to save you.” He whispered back as he placed me in my seat.

As he walked quickly back to his side, I just had this feeling that the past was going to happen again. “Things are going to get bad, aren’t they?” I asked as he got in.

Alec started the car and drove off before he answered. “Depends what she is up to.”

Without waiting for him, I reached over and grabbed his hand from the steering wheel. It surprised him alittle but he was also happy that I did it. “I assume she is going to want the money.” “your dad had an iron clad will. What ground would she have?” Alec was driving incredibly fast for as snow packed as the roads where. Still, I wanted to get home. Out here, I felt exposed and vulnerable.

“We might just find out.” The rest of the drive was silent as Alec focused on the road. Thankfully, we didn’t have that much more to go before we pulled into the garage. “I'll come get you.” Alec said as he turned off the engine.

My hand was already on the door.

There wasn’t any point of arguing, especially since my ankle was really fat. Alec opened the door and pulled me out before picking me up.

“I could get used to this.” I teased as my finger traced his chin.

“Woman....” Alec playfully glared at me as he opened the door.

Vivian was surprised to see us. “Home so early?” She looked at her watch in confusion. Adalynn had woken up from her afternoon nap and was eating a snack.

“We are but if you don’t mind, we need you to stay around. We have multiple people coming over for a meeting. We will be down stairs so you guys can stay here.” Alec said as he walked me to the bedroom.









###Chapter 0556 

After changing into sweats, Alec carried me down stairs. The basement was like another living area. With three couches circling around the 85 inch television, there was a completely separate office area. Since we planned ahead, that office is completely soundproof and doubles as a panic room. Since it has multiple couches that pull out into beds, it was ideal for all of the alphas to come together and have a private meeting.

Alec placed me on one of the couches and moved the ottoman over for me to keep my foot raised. Just as he was putting some ice on it, the door bell rang. “I'll be right back.” The anger was still stewing inside him but I just felt numb.

As soon as I was left alone, I closed my eyes and tried to focus on my own feelings. The shock has faded and all that was left was anger, confusion and a sense of doom. Whatever she had planned was not going to be good.

As you slowly take the lid off something, I tried to do that to my feelings. They were currently pushed down and sealed so trying to slowly open the container was difficult. The visual of the lid finally opening was like opening Pandora’s Box. They all came back in full force. The sudden rush of emotion left me panicked to the point that I shut that lid so tight.

“Hey, Ice.” Colt said as he came down the stairs. I tried to hide my heavy breathing but it was difficult.

“Where is Penny?” I asked as I only

saw Colt walk around the corner.

“She wanted to stay home with the kids.” He sat down next me to. “Treally am sorry. I honestly thought she was dead.” “That isn’t the worrisome part. The fact that Anthony got into your cells and staged her death. Just for the dramatic affect of walking down the aisle for the luna ceremony.” Colt looked down and nodded as I just laid out my only concern. It wasn’t his fault and even if he had known that wasn’t her, the outcome wouldn’t have changed. “What could she want?” “My guess is the money.” I said as Carson, Hank and Alec all walked into the room.

“T don’t see how. The will kept Ann

from getting anything.” Carson just stood off to the side with his arms folded. Hank sat on the adjacent couch, just shaking his head.

“How did you open your shop?” Hank asked me.

“Dad loaned me the money and I paid him back. I didn’t make a profit until it was completely paid off.” I looked over at Colt. “She can’t say that was her money. Even if it was, I still paid it all back.” ‘Yeah but dad took that money and put it back into your account. He would add little at a time so you would never notice. She might be able to say that she is owed something since she didn’t see the money.” Colt looked over at Alec. noveldrama

My heart sank at that. As soon as I

went to push that down, I stopped myself. I couldn’t loses my shop but I couldn’t afford to add that to the box.

“We won't let her take it.” Carson said, softly, like he was trying to sound like a father figure.

More footsteps sounded around the corner until Jace and Lars walked in.

Alec walked over and shut the door, seeling off the soundproofing. Colt stood up to shake their hands.

“Sit by me?” I asked Alec in the mind- link. He didn’t answer nor was he surprised. However, he was happy.

Putting his hand on my thigh, I slipped my arm around his to anchor myself as we had this discussion.

“Now that we are all here.” Colt started. His eyes landed on my hand on Alec’s arm, he sat down next to Hank.

Carson stayed standing and Jace and Lars all took a seat. “What the fuck just happened?” iu “Does anyone else think he had something to do with Molly’s death?” asked the room. & It was as if no one else had thought about that, everyone stiffened up and looked around. “Surely, not...” Lars looked sick.

“He figured out where my cells were, staged a rogue attack and planted someone else there. It was all too perfectly planned out. The timing would suggest he could have had something to do with it. Otherwise, why spring her out?” Colt worked through what I said out loud.

“This is the way I see it.” Carson looked at Colt with complete

seriousness. “Either you Rerian war and fight it out or you wait and see what happens. We already cut ties. I'll submit all the paperwork but unless you want to go back to war, we will just have to wait and see what happens.” If Alec wasn’t holding into me, he would have probably flipped his shit.

“He attacked Kristen. She almost died.” @ “You boys have the reasons and we will back it up but unless you want to go back to war, what choice do you have?” Carson kept looking between Colt and Alec.

“Stage your own attacks.” Jace said quietly from the back of the room. We all turned to look at him. “Am I the only one under the impression you

have a couple people in your packs that have knowledge of some shady people?” 5 “You want us to let Gunther loose to terrorize Anthony?” Alec looked over at Colt in shock.

“Or Zac. Either one or both. What do you have to lose?” Jace sat back and looked at them. He knew he was right but neither Alec or Colt thought about that possibility.

“That really isn’t a terrible idea. Send someone with them that you trust and organize hell for them. If nothing else, it will be entertaining to watch him get attacked.” Lars seemed way too excited for this.

I was feeling petty enough that I was on board with it. “Does anyone know the layout of Anthony’s pack?” A












###Chapter 0557 

Alec looked back at me. “You're for this idea?” “Gunther or Zac know people. Like Lars said, send someone with him but Gunther needs to prove himself to you, right?” I asked, looking at Colt. “What better assignment than to organize an attack on Anthony. If we had their layout, we can give them more information.” “I'll have a conversation with him. I'll start there and see what his thoughts are.” Colt agreed reluctantly.

“What's the hesitations?” Carson folded his arms.

“Last time I did that, it did nothing for me. Zac only made my life harder. It

was only when I put a tracker under his tongue did we actually get somewhere.” Colt leaned back. He obviously didn’t like the idea.

“Who knows, maybe this time will be different.” Hank stood up and looked around. “We should all get our troops ready for a moments notice but it is your guy’s call.” His eyes looked between Colt and myself.

“I don’t want a war. We will have a discussion with Gunther and let everyone know. Otherwise, we will see how this plays out.” I said firmly.

Colt looked at me and leaned forward.

“Are you sure? After all the abuse she put you through?” Giving Colt a sad smile, our hands were tied. “He has already marked her and claimed her. I wouldn’t be surprised if

she was his fated mate that she rejected for dad. Either way, Anthony is right. Above all, fated mates cannot be kept from the other. Since we cut ties, we just need to be on guard for anything.” “We can’t just ignore this either.” Jace said a little more fired up. “This paints you as weak.” Colt stood up and looked at him. “I agree but we have to be smart about this. Anthony knows what my pack looks like. He knows how we operate and what moves I would make. For anything to work, we need to do something unexpected. As much as I want to kill him, it was Kristen who has suffered the most.” Jace ran his fingers through his hair.

“Whatever you decide.” He shook his


head but stuck his hand out Colt took it without hesitation. “Thank you, man.” Lars stood up and stuck out his hand.

“We will be back for the ball. Give us an update then if we haven’t heard from you in the mean time.” Alec stood up to shake everyone's hand as they walked out. At the sudden loss of touch, I could feel the emotions trying to break free of the box. Trying to hide it, I smiled and shook their hands as they walked out.

However, I wasn’t surprised Colt sat down and looked at me. “What do you really think?” “Send someone with Gunther. See what he thinks. I’m not against giving them hell. Even if it is rogue attack

after rogue attack. Get creative but I want to give her as much hell as she gave me.” All the anger and years with of frustration and humiliation boiled out of me. My eyes were glowing but not in rage. In anticipation I could finally repay the life lessons she tough me.

“We will find a way to give her hell.” Colt promised as he stood up and marched out to the door and stopped.

Turning, he looked at us, “Come to my office tomorrow morning and we will talk with Gunther.” Without waiting a response, he walked out. noveldrama

«Close the door.” I told Alec after a few minutes.

Alec got my mood as he closed the door. He didn’t say anything as he looked at me in the eyes. The look of a

dominate male, coming up on his female pray sent nothing but pleasure to my core. Clawing up to me, his lips firmly planted against mine.

There wasn’t any passion here but raw hot sexual tension. The bag of ice fell to the floor as we each stripped out of our clothes. Pushing him back, I got to my knees as Alec pulled off my shirt.


My hands went to his belt but Alec shoved me back. I fell against the couch in surprise but looking back at Alec, he had a very primal look in his eyes. Without breathing eye contact, he used one hand to unbuckle his belt.

My eyes went to his belt as he whipped it off him and wrapped around his hands. I couldn’t help but bite my Jower lip in anticipation.

He reached down and grabbed behind my knees and ripped me down towards him. Grabbing my bra, he completely ripped it off, slicing my skin a little bit it only fueled his need.

Feeling a little seductive, my hands moved on their own. Squeezing my own tit, my other hand reached down to play with myself. That gave Alec pause as he watched my movements.

I was just getting into it when I felt his hand wrapped around my neck.

Grabbing a fist full of hair, he pulled me up to the point I had to stop touching myself and use my hands for support.

I wasn’t even aware of what is going on as he picked me up and pulled me to the ground. Forcing me on my

stomach, he pulled my hair, making me look up.

“This is my body to touch.” He growled. My eyes rolled back into my head as his teeth left bit marks from my neck to the newly found spot on my side.

My body reacted on its own and arched, pushing my ass into him. As wet as I was, I wasn’t prepared for his fingers to start pounding me.

“Fuck me!” I growled back. I needed to feel him.

I wasn’t prepared for his fingers to leave me and his dick to replace them.

still, he never let go of my hair. With his other hand on my hip, Alec jack hammered into me like he never had before.

pulling out of my pussy, he rammed it into my ass. My scream was caught in my throat as pleasure filled me:












###Chapter 0558 

“Pretty sure I lived up toyour standards and the fact you can’t walk today is proof of that.” Alec whispered in my ear as he walked around me. After he finished last night in the panic room, we spent the evening with Adalynn before he picked up where he left off. Staying true to his word, he made sure I was suffering today. Still, I couldn’t help the sarcastic remarks that were surely going to be biting me in the ass later.

“It has nothing to do with the fact that I am back in my boot and since I only had one leg to begin with, you get half credit.” I had just finished putting my makeup on so as [ applied my lipstick, I

got the pleasure of watching his body freeze, turn and narrow his eyes. Being as sexy as I could, licking my freshly red lips, I just batted my eyes at him.

Alec gave me a look that said, challenge accepted as he nodded his head. “Okay.” The black business leggings went to my ankle, making it good to pair with an actual boot. It was the same height of the medical boot so my hips didn’t suffer. I had on off the shoulder red blouse. Standing up, I grabbed my leather black jacket and flicked my girl as I turned to walk away from him.

I made it a few steps before he hand wrapped in my hair and pull me firmly against him. His other hand wrapped around me, slipped under my pants

and found my clit. “What was that?” He growled.

I'had to reach back and hold onto him for support as he massaged away.

Making my legs go limp, my lips were tinglingly and I couldn’t form a word.

Only after my orgasm hit, did he let up on me.

Alec made sure I was standing before he let me go and walked away, feeling rather proud of himself. “Fuck...” I said under my breath.

“What was that?” Alec stuck his head out from the closet.

“I’m thirsty!” Iyelled back as I held my head high as I walked out of our bedroom.


I could hear his laughter as I walked into Adalynn’s room. She was just

starting to stir, Her little eyes looked up at me, still full of sleep. “Good morning, sweet girl.” Leaning over the crib, Tjust rested my head on the rails.

My finger gently rubbed her cheek as she struggled to wake up.

I felt Alec’s presence behind us but he stayed at the door, just watching us.

Finally, Adalynn grabbed her lovey and sat up. Grabbing her, she immediately put her head on my shoulder. Moving to the rocking chair, I sat down with her and enjoyed some snuggles. I knew it was going to be short lived so I was going to take it all in.

Alec sneezed and Adalynn leaned up.

“Shh..” I tried to put her head back down but she looked over at her dad.

“Da da.” Adalynn cried.

“Did she just say dada?” Alec asked as he took her from me, “Yeah...” Sighing, I was both happy and broken hearted. It wasn’t a surprise she said dada first but [ had held out hope.

Making our way to the kitchen, I started to pull out a pan to making some scrambled eggs and sausage. “Do you want to be a big sister?” Alec cooed as he sat her down.

“Can’t get me pregnant if you ram it in my ass.” Breaking some eggs, I got it all situated as Alec walked up behind me. “Still not satisfied?” “I think it’s more of your desire to get me pregnant again.” We heard the door open as he leaned down and

wy TV BUNUS kissed my neck.

“This room is cursed.” Alec sighed as he walked around and sat down on a stool.


The eggs started cooking as Vivian walked in. “It’s a cold one out today!” “If we could move south, I would love to.” Putting some eggs on a plate, I blew on them to cool them off.

However, I caught Alec’s eyes and couldn’t help but smirk as he watched me.

“Wouldn't that be nice!” Vivian laughed as she came around. “You two need to get going or you will be late.

There is suppose to be another storm and I don’t want you caught in it.” “Another snow storm? At this rate, the

wy TY BUNS snow will cover our house!” Looking at the windows, there was already a layer of snow at the bottom, “Have a good day.” Alec said to Adalynn and kissed her forehead.

“Dada!” She cried and reached out to him. Her little hands squeezed, trying to get another hug.

My heart swelled in how much I loved watching Alec be a dad to our little girl.

As much as it hurt she wanted him more than me, I felt so much love. It was moments like this that made it okay for me to have another one.

“Alright, super dad. Let’s go.” Not waiting for Alec to let our daughter go, I turned and went into the garage. I made it a foot inside the door when two strong arms wrapped around me. “You

J +15 BONUS will always be my first girl,” “Look who is turning into quite the softy.” Laughing, he almost made me trip. However, he kept his arms around me until I was safely in my seat.

Alec walked around and got into the truck and started the engine. Since it was going to get worse, he decided this was the safest option. “I’m not soft.” Reaching over, I grabbed his dick.

“Feel’s soft to me.” “Going to fix that?” Alec asked as he pulled out and got on the road.

“Maybe on our way home if you are extra nice to me today.” The truck slid a little, making me grab the door.

“When is my jeep going to be fixed?”noveldrama

“Next week or so. There really wasn’t that much damage. Mostly body work.” Alec reached over and grabbed my thigh.

“The armor really would have saved us.” I'was looking out of the window when his finger wrapped under my chin and pulled my face towards him. “I felt you trying to feel those emotions you pushed down.”












###Chapter 0559 

«It’s like... if I push them down, I can’t open that box again. If I did, I would get overwhelmed and I don’t think I could handle that.” “How about tonight. We will lock ourselves in the panic room and you need to let all those emotions out.

Together, we will work through them.

You can yell, hit, cry or whatever you want until you work through them. I'll be beside you the whole time.” I hated everything about that plan.

Nothing sounded like something I wanted to experience. “I think they are okay in the box.” “Kristen. This is happening. I'll be with you. You can lean on me and I won’t think less of you. I won't even tell

anyone about it. It stays between us.

Not even Colt will know.” That was a different kind of emotion.

Not telling Colt? I told him everything.

By doing this, it was like I officially stepped out of Colt’s embrace and put my complete trust in Alec. noveldrama

It was that realization that shocked me more than anything. If I truly opened up and did this... there wasn’t anything left in my soul that Alec hadn’t touched. Only Colt has seen that side of me and even then, it was only what I allowed him too.

“you're afraid.” Alec said. It was more of a statement than a question.

“1...” Panic started to rise as I thought about giving that part to him. I loved him with everything in me but the idea of doing something like that scared the

shit out of me. I would rather face Darin again than do that.

“Hey!” Alec slammed on the breaks and forced me to look at him.

“Breath!” “I’'m.... okay...” As on reflex, I went to shove that feeling down.

“DON’T!” Alec growled. My eyes landed on his. If I had any air in my lungs, it would have been sucked out.

The love and concern was so strong that I was caught off guard. “Feel it.

Feel how scared you are of it. Feel how vulnerable it makes you. Allow those feelings to relax as you accept them.

Accept them and let them simmer down.” I tried to do as he said. Closing my

eyes, I focused on the anxiety that it caused. I kept repeating that I could do it. I have tackled every other obstacle in my path and now I was going to tackle this. Putting on a brave face was something I was good at. Feeling emotions was something I failed at.

“There you go. That’s my girl.” Alec said softly as he pulled me towards him. He kissed me gently on the lips.

His forehead rested against mine as he let me breathe. Only once it was back to a shallow, calm breathing, did he speak again. “Give me this last part that you have been holding out on. It’s time.” part of me was surprised he noticed but the other part wasn’t. He was extremely observant and I barely got away with anything. “I'll try.” I said

finally.

“It’s a date.” Alec pulled away and put down on the gas. Still, his hand never left my thigh as I clutched on to it.

A date is usually something I looked forward too. This was not. Never thought I would dread a date before but here we were. As the trees flew by us, it almost seemed.... well, I wasn’t sure what the right word was. Now that Ann was alive, I didn’t want to go to Colt’s pack. She wasn’t there but it felt tainted somehow.

As we pulled up to the gates, the guard nodded at us and let us in. “I don’t want to be here. Now I know she is out, it just seems... weird. I know that’s not logical but...” “1 get it.” Alec nodded as he looked out the window. He was pulling into the

parking space that had been mine since I could drive. “Like the dark cloud is back, hanging over the pack.” “Exactly.” There wasn’t any pushing this off. Alec came around and opened my door for me. Smirking, I tried to take off the red lipstick on his lips but they were still stained a little.

“Is it there there?” Alec asked. As soon as I was out of the car, he looked in the side mirror.

“Just marking my territory.” Shrugging, I didn’t really care if he had it there or not.

“Little jealous are we?” Alec looked at me and smirked.

“Not jealous, territorial.” Rolling my eyes, I tried to stomp away but Alec

easily caught up to me “Careful. I don’t think you can afford to break your other ankle.” He said as he grabbed my elbow to help me up the stairs.

“Since I have feeling in my legs, I think I am okay.” Alec narrowed his eyes at me. “You did that on purpose.” Looking back at the car, he though I set up the emotions so he didn’t tease me on the way here.

“That’s not true. That was not planned but it is nice when things work out in my favor.” Smiling, I opened the front door.

“Ice!” Colt was coming down the stairs.

“Hey!” I said, smiling.

EY TT Te “I take it the drive was okay?” He came up to me and gave me a hug { “Nothing special. Just more white bullshit.” “That is true. Let's get this meeting over with so you guys can head home and not get caught in it.” Colt held his hand out to Alec.

Alec took it but as soon as Colt turned and walked back to his office, he grabbed me and kept me close to him.

“Now who is territorial.” I said in the mind-link.

“I don’t try to hide it though. You are mine.” “1 don’t hide it! I just express myself differently.” “Well, express yourself on the way home. That is a language you are good

at.” Alec smirked as we walked into the office.

Gunther was already sitting and waiting for us. As we walked past Colt, he shut and locked the door.










###Chapter 0560 

As we walked in, Gunther looked very on edge. He was sitting on one of the arm chairs but he quickly stood up and seemed very defensive. “What is going on? Why am I here?” “Relax, you aren’t in trouble.” Colt said as he walked around his desk and sat down. Alec moved me to the other arm chair and sat me down, However, he stayed standing right behind me with his arms folded.

“I don’t like this.” Gunther's hair was literally on edge as he looked between us. “In my experience, it’s never good to be required to speak to the person in charge.” “Gunther, please relax. We just wanted to talk.” I said, taking the lead. Maybe

Sw *1580NUS if a female spoke to him, he wouldn’t be as jittery, His eyes looked at me and narrowed.

“About what?” “When you were working under Darin... or Rip for that matter, you met alot of... interesting people.” Gunther’s eyes looked over at Colt and then at Alec before coming back to me.

“Sp?” “You're talking to me. Not to them.” I said firmly. I could fee] the pettiness and desire for revenge fill in me.

“Not sure that is better.” Gunther muttered as he gripped the back of the chair. Both Colt and Alec found this amusing.

Ignoring the comment completely, I kept going. “What do you know of my

father’s mate, Ann?” 1 decided to do this a little differently.

“Not much. Just that he dumped her and Colt took over. She is in the cells or something?” “Yes and no. Ann was our step mother.

Every chance she got, she would emotionally and physically abuse me. I can’t tell you how many times I bled because of her. I hate her with every fiber of my being. I would rather face Darin again than see her face, if that tells you anything.” “Damn.” Gunther rubbed the back of his head. “What does this have to do with me?” “I have a job for you.” “Do I have a choice?” Gunther looked at the ceiling.

“you always have a choice but I think you are going to want to hear me out.” “I’m listening.” Gunther folded his arms and looked at me.

“Alpha Anthony used his alliance with us to scout out this territory. The rogue attacks we had were staged so he could get into our cells and get Ann out. He has now mated and marked Ann.

Making her his luna.

Now, we can’t touch her without declaring war.” Gunther’s eyes narrowed as he tookit all in. “I see.” «The attack on this pack and the attack on me... we believe he ordered them...

for her.” 1looked at him dead in the face, “I want to repay the favor without

declaring war. War means death of our warriors and I want to terrorize them. I want them to suffer and I want to repay Ann back for all the shit she put me through.” I knew my wolf was showing herself.

By the look Gunther was giving me, he was a little taken aback. “Shit.” “This is where you come in. I want you to reach out to people. Organize every single little thing that would annoy them. I want you to be the fucking cock roach that they can’t get rid of. You would have free rein and endless funds at your disposal.” “Why not organize this yourself? You want me to ask rogues or anyone else to put their lives at risk for your personal vendetta?” Gunther looked shocked.

“First off, rogues live off borrowed time. I'll pay whoever survives but | honestly don’t give a shit about their lives. They chose that. As far as organizing it myself, I don’t want my name attached to it. I want to be able to deny any involvement, the same way he did to the attack on me. The attack that almost costed me my life. An eye for an eye. Isn’t that the rogue way of life? I’m surprised you even give a shit about their lives.

You didn’t when you tried to get them to attack us?” He knew I had him there. I could see his wheels working. “You want me to do terrorize another alpha? I could do whatever I wanted. What if I got caught?” “That’s the beauty of being a cocknoveldrama

roach, you end up finding your way out of sticky situations.” “You saved Zac multiple times.” “That was more because he was Penny’s biological father but if we can save you too, we will.” Shrugging, I sat back in my chair.

“The rumors are true, you are far worse to deal with than Colt.” Gunther frowned as he looked at me.

“What do you say? Are you going to rise to the occasion or are you too scared? Just think of how much fun you will have by doing this. All those things you wanted to do to Colt or Rip. You will be able to do to Anthony.” I waited a beat before continuing. “Of course, you can say no and return to your room. Return to your domesticated life with Kara. Stare at the same four walls

with no career, no income to pull of, live in a pack that despises your very existence or would you like to prove \ yourself? I don’t care what you want to do but I can look at myself in the mirror at night.” “Can I talk to Kara?” “No. This is a one time offer. Either take it or leave it. Are you my guy for the job or do I need to find different arrangements?” Gunther looked at me for a moment before taking a few steps towards the door but coming back. He ran his hands through his hair then looked at me before shaking his head and walking back to the door. He was struggling hard.

“Going once...” I said. His body stopped and looked at me. He was torn

and wasn’t sure what to do. “Going twice...” Gunther opened his mouth a few times but then closed them again.

“Goi-" “WAIT!” He yelled.









###Chapter 0561 

“Yes?” I asked. My voice was extra sweet. Very much unlike me right now.

Even my eyes knew what he was going to say and I was happy.

“Fine. I'll doit.” “Thats the spirit!” I gave him a smile as he looked at me like I was crazy.

“can I go? I would like to get ready.” Gunther looked around before settling back on me.

“sure but this goes without saying, you don’t tell anyone what you are doing.

Not even Kara.” My aura shot out, making the command strong. It wouldn’t be as strong as Colt’s but it still held some weight.

Gunther didn’t like that but he didn’t

argue. Instead, he darted out of the office as quickly as he could. “That went... well” Colt said as he sat down.

My wolf relaxed as I sat back in my chair. “It will be interesting to see if Ann and Anthony come to the ball. I assume she will.” “Do you honestly think they will come?” Alec moved around and sat down as well.

“T do. I think she will want to parade around. The key will be to get under her skin. We will have to act like her presence doesn’t bother us. Ignore her like she doesn’t matter. She likes the attention and think she should be the center of it. I think it’s time I take a page out of her book.” wasn’t going to push my feelings

down but I was sure as hell going to bring out every ounce of Petty I had. I would make inappropriate comments and make jokes at her expense. I was going to give it back like I got it growing up.

“Ice storm is out to play.” Colt looked like he was enjoying this a little too much. “You are going to have your hands full to keep her safe.” “I know.” Alec was both proud and concerned. As much as he wanted to keep me in his bubble, that wasn’t going to happen.

“Let’s call Zac and see if there is anyone or anywhere we could go to help our cause. He knows a different area of the dark side.” Colt looked taken aback but didn’t question it too much. “He will be here

shortly.” “Good. Good.” I nodded. “You know.

We should deliver two dozen roses to Anthony as a luna present. Play a mind game with them.” “You want to send roses to Ann?” Colt asked like he didn’t hear me right.

“If we got roses from Ann, how would you feel about them?” “1 would feel like she was up to something and toss them.” He said instantly.

“They would be on the back of your mind the whole time, wouldn’t they?” A sly little smile spread across my face.

“you would be wondering if they were bugged or what the motive behind them. We can even write, can’t wait to see you at the ball!”

Colt shook his head but laughed.

“Penny will get on that.” A knock sounded at the door. Alec got up to answer it. “Perfect.” I turned as Zac looked confused but walked in. He stood off to the side like Gunther did and folded his arms. “You wanted to see me?” His mouth didn’t even open as he looked at Colt. Major authority issues.

“How is the domesticated life?” I asked before Colt sound say anything.

“peachy.” His eyes narrowed but it was his clenched jaw that show how much restraint he had.

“What if I told you we had a more...

luxurious challenge for you?” “Luxurious? What kind of job would be

described as luxurious?” “I want to give create all the havoc as possible. I want you to go back under and give Alpha Anthony all the shit and then some.” It was entertaining to watch his facial expression completely shift from anger to shock.

“Seriously?” His eyes kept looking over at Colt.

“You did nothing but give Colt headaches when we were dealing with Darin. I don’t see why you can’t handle this.” My head tilted to the side as his eyes narrowed at me.

«I was trying to save my daughter.” “And yet the only thing you accomplished was to raise Colt’s blood pressure. He had to save you more

times than you achieved anything.

However, now we are asking that you torment Anthony. You have free rein-to do whatever you want to do. Anything and everything. Nothing is too small and nothing is too large.” “Why?” “Can you not do it?” Colt asked this time.

“1 can do it... T just don’t know why I am doing this.” “personal satisfaction.” I gave hima fuck you smile as he processed it.

Zac put his hands on his hip. “What do I get if I do this?” Colt sat back and folded his arms over his chest. “What do you want?” “This fucking restriction lifted.”

“If you do enough damage to them, I'l] lift any restriction you have.” Colt answered after a moment.

Zac pointed his finger at Colt. “Fine. I want money and supplies.” Colt just shrugged. “Make a list.” 7ac looked around, unsure if he heard anything before he walked out without saying a word. “Between Gunther and Zac, 1 feel like we will get something done.” Colt nodded.

“Not that I don’t trust them but IT want to keep an eye on them. I want to actually follow them and see what they are up to. I want to do my own damage.” “That might be a little much.” Colt looked at me worried.

“Eighteen years I had to deal with hernoveldrama

abuse. Let me work through my own emotions how I see fit.” I tried to stand up but had to hold onto his desk to get my balance.

“Fine but one of us goes with you. You are not going out on your own and we will always be with you.” Colt did not like what he was hearing. He leaned forward and put his arms on his desk.














###Chapter 0562 

“Whatever makes you sleep at night.

Either way, I am happy she is alive. I am going to make her wish she was dead.” As gracefully as I could, I walked out of Colt’s office. Alec didn’t follow me but I could feel his concern he had over my newly found coping strategy.

People were walking around like a normal day. The staff was working on waxing the floor so anytime anyone got around there, they were yelling at them to keep off.

Right as I was about to walk out the front door, the alarm went off. My entire body froze as I heard the growls from across the way. A few people bumped into me, making me trip over

my boot. noveldrama

The warriors instantly shifted into the wolves and the females ran inside the packhouse. Colt and Alec came flying out before shifting in mid air.

“Where are you?” Alec growled in my head.

“On the porch.” “Stay there!” Alec and Colt stood in front of the pack house as some rogues made their way into the front lawn. | “Get inside!” I yelled to the last remaining women. As soon as the elderly and kids got inside, I shut the door and stood in front of it.

“What are you doing? Get inside!” Alec yelled as his wolf turned and looked at me.

“Turn around and pay attention. They are coming up on your left.” Just as I finished talking, two rogues jumped at the same time Alec did.

Between Colt and Alec, my eyes kept scanning the lawn to make sure no one got close to the packhouse.

The whole thing lasted just a few minutes before all the rogues were killed. Not a single warrior was injured.

The whole thing felt juvenile. “This felt more like a distraction than anything.” I muttered to myself. Colt and Alec shifted back to their wolves as warriors brought them shorts.

The doors opened, making me jump a little. “Kristen.” Alec’s voice caught me off guard. My heart was relaxing as I turned and looked at him. He caught my jump.

“Turn around and pay attention. They are coming up on your left.” Just as I finished talking, two rogues jumped at the same time Alec did.

Between Colt and Alec, my eyes kept scanning the lawn to make sure no one got close to the packhouse.

The doors opened, making me jump a little. “Kristen.” Alec’s voice caught me off guard. My heart was relaxing as I turned and looked at him. He caught my jump.

Why I felt so ashamed, I wasn’t sure.

“I’m good.” Wanting to ignore it, I tried to act like it was nothing.

Walking down the stairs, I went to the car to grab my phone. I wasn’t sure exactly why I was doing this but it felt like the right thing. Alec and Colt were busy cleaning up the lawn and putting all the rogues into a pile to burn.

“Kristen.” This time, I heard his foot steps. Reaching down, I picked up my phone. There was a total of six missed called and a dozen text.

“This was just pathetic, don’t you think? Like a dozen rogues to attack the pack?” Without looking at Alec, I just started shifting through the text. “Look at

me.” His finger went under my chin and tilted my face up before I could read a message. ee “Love, look at me.” “Pretty sexy with only shorts on.” My finger trailed down the center of his chest.

His hand wrapped around the back of my neck and the other firmly grabbed my hip. Pulling me against him, he planted a firm kiss to my lips. “Ilove you.” He whispered in my head.

I couldn’t help the little whimper that escaped me before I could compose myself. “I don’t know why that affected me. I've seen you fight before.

I've fought rogues my whole life. That was literally nothing.” Alec rested his forehead against mine.

“Because you are finally allowing your feelings to come to the surface. This is how you work through them. Feel them, deal with it and then let it go.” “Everything okay?” Colts voice broke our moment and forced us to take a step back. However, Alec kept his hand around my waist, which I was thankful for.

“yeah. What’s up?” Alec answered for us both. Wanting to avoid eye contact, I looked back at my phone.

“Appears to be-" Colt’s voice faded to the background as I read the messages. My heart started racing again but it was the water in my eyes that made it difficult. “Ice?” 1 heard but I couldn’t bring myself to look at him.

pulling up my voice mail, I hit play and then put it on speaker phone.

“Kristen! T-these guys came into your shop and destroyed it! I-it’s gone! Come quick!” It was Polly’s voice. She was working today as the office manager.

“No... no...no.” I whispered. All the emotions rose up to the point that I felt like I was drowning. I couldn’t doit. I couldn’t get lost in all this. I needed to keep my head in the game.

Before Alec could even say anything, I pushed part of them down. Just enough so I wouldn’t cry. Enough that outwardly, I could think rationally but on the inside, it felt like I was dying.

“Alpha Colt!” A guard ran forward. He was completely drenched in sweat,

even though there was a foot of snow on the ground.

“What?” Colt asked, clearly annoyed.

“you don’t have your phone on you but one of our guards just woke up. He said there was an attack at the club. The fire department is there now.” Colt and I shared looks. We knew who was behind this. It was a ‘if I can’t have it, no one can.’ The guard looked at us for a moment before he ran off.

My body started shivering. I wasn’t sure if it was from the cold or if it was because I was one more disaster from having a mental breakdown. “Fuck.” Colt ran his fingers through his hair.

“Gunther and Zac better come

through.” I whispered with so much venom that it even surprised me.

“You can go to your shop and I'll go to the club.” Colt looked at me like he wanted to say something.

“Don’t. I'll reach out to you with details.” I said before I got into the car, impatiently waiting for Alec to join me.










###Chapter 0563 

As he got in, I just turned and looked out the window. I knew Alec wanted me to work through my feelings but honestly right now, I just wanted to punch someone or something.

It seemed like forever before we even got there. It was like deja vu with the yellow caution tape. As we walked in, all my staff was standing around, looking at the mess.

«Luna! I'm so sorry. They came in and there wasn’t anything we could do!” Polly ran forward. It looked like she had been crying.

“Alpha Alec. I- I tried to fight back...” Calvin was sporting a fresh bruise to his temple and his jaw. His lip was split and his eye was starting to swell.

«None of this was your fault 2 Alec said firmly. There was sO much anger in him that I just felt numb.

“Get out.” I whispered.

«w-what?” Polly looked worriedly at Alec.

«1eave.” Closing my eyes, just wanted everyone to get out.

No one spoke but the sounds of feet shuffling and glass sliding around, I knew they were all leaving. Only when I was sure they were gone, did I open my eyes and look around. The chairs had been ripped apart. My pictures had fallen from the wall. Even the huge picture of Alec’s back was in pieces.

My anger was boiling so the point that [ bent over and picked up a piece of

wood. Looking at what was left on my 360 degree mirror, I just chucked the piece of wood at it. Sounds of breaking glass peppered my soul, letting loose my wolf.

She was furious. Grabbing everything we could, we just threw it that much harder at the wall or even just across the room. Nothing was safe. Any pictures left standing were now in more pieces. Every piece of glass had been forcefully ripped from the wall but it wasn’t until I started punching holes in the wall did two strong arms wrap around me, pinning my hands down.

“shhh.” Alec whispered in my ear. I couldn’t stop the water works from spilling over. noveldrama

My legs gave out, making us both

slowly fall to the floor. “It’s all gone.” “We will rebuild. The same way we did last time.” Alec pulled me into his lap.

Holding me like a little child, he rocked me. As much as I felt like it was stupid, I needed this. I needed his comfort right now. “Feel this anger. All the sadness and frustration. Feel it all and work through it. Don’t push this down.

No one is here to see you. It’s just me.

Lean on me. Let me comfort you.” “Maybe this shop isn’t ment to be anymore.” I just wanted to leave. I didn’t want to be here anymore. Just seeing this place was keeping the wound open and bleeding.

“What do you mean?” Alec unfolded his arm and pulled me back so he could see my tear soaked face.

“Maybe I need to cut this place off.” “I don’t know that is the answer.” Using his thumbs, he tried to wipe away the black smudges I’m sure were running down my face.

“No. I'm done. I don’t want to do this anymore. The more I care, the more I lose.” Standing up, I just wanted to leave. Alec followed me as I turned the light off and walked to the car.


Alec wasn’t directly behind me so when he took a second to get into the car, I was surprised to see him holding a few things. “You may want these.” Alec set them in the back seat before turning around.

Looking back, I noticed my portfolio and a few pictures that were rolled up but I didn’t want to look at it.

“Gunther and Zac better get their shit together. I want them to be in hell.” “They will.” Alec pulled out of the parking spot. His hand twitched a few times like he wanted to touch me but I was facing away from him.

“Do you want to go to the club?” “Might as well.” The rest of the ride was silent. It gave me time to reflect on the tattoo shop.

The memory of dad handing me the keys for the first time. My first tattoo, the hours I spent there cleaning or getting ready for going out. To the moment I first met Alec. That shop really gave me an out. Gave me a chance to grow without being under the eye of my dad or Ann.

However, it was also a target. Being in neutral territory, it will always be just that. Any enemies we have, that shop will be somewhere they will start. If I ever opened another one, it would have to be in our own territory. Most of my clients were wolves anyway and it wasn’t like I needed the money. Maybe it was time to sell that location and have a serious conversation about my future as a tattoo artist.

Pulling into the parking lot of the bar, only a small amount of smoke was drifting upward into the sky. The whole building was flattened. Not even part of a wall was standing. Just a large heap of charred wood and metal.

Colt was standing with his hands on his hips, just looking at it. There was some warriors with hoses, trying to put it out. Alec pulled into a parking spot

but he didn’t get out right away.

“I know you are not okay but don’t push me away.” My hand was on the door handle when he spoke. Everything in me froze as I turned to look at him. He had so much emotion in his eyes that I was briefly silenced. “Just because I didn’t hold your hand on the way over here that I am pushing you away?” More anger than anything filled me as I pushed opened the door and got out.

Not waiting for Alec, I walked over to Colt. “What’s wrong?” Colt asked without even looking at me.

«Is that a serious question?” Crossing my arms over my chest, I felt Alec walk up beside me.

“Kristen.” Colt pinched the bridge of

| his nose.










###Chapter 0564

 «Alec thinks I am pushing him away because I didn’t hold his hand on the way over here.” I knew I sounded like a brat but I didn’t care.

“Just because it is easier to push your anger off to him doesn’t mean it’s okay and when did this problem start up again? I thought you were past that?” Colt looked down at me and frowned.

«you are taking his side? Tam you twin!” “Listen, I know working through your emotions is new for you but here is a piece of advice for you.

Emotional people can’t make rational decisions. Mates are here to protect

you physically and emotionally as well as mentally. Let Alec help you work through this shit so you can focus and make the right decisions when it comes to getting back at them. I need your brain and having an overly emotional sister is only going to make mistakes. Pull your head out of your ass and just do it.” I was a little put off from his tone. He usually had a softer tone when dealing with me but he wasn’t wrong.

Thankfully, the warrior finished putting out what little bit of fire was left and Colt walked off to check it out.

We stood by for awhile to watch everyone work. Alec didn’t try to touch me but he did stay close to me. Since I was still feeling a little resentment, I just stood around. With this boot, 1

couldn’t walk over to where the office was or even see if I could find anything.

1 The longer I stood there, the more I craved revenge. Gunther and Zac better come through or I might just end them myself. I wanted termites planted on their house. Beg bugs needed to be freed. I wanted them to suffer, not kill innocent people. Still, it dawned on me that we might still have allies within his pack that were forced to work with him.

“Colt?” I said quietly. I knew he would hear me so there wasn’t any point in shouting.

yeah?” He answered without looking at me. He was standing with his warrior, looking at something in the ashes.

“pon’t you still have a friend that is a warrior for Anthony?” As hard as | tried to wrack my brain for his name; 1 was coming up short.

Colt looked over at me and squinted his eyes. “Yeeeeeah. Nox?” «yeah. Would he approve of all this or would he want to help us?” I watched as Colt processed this information. “I'll figure it out.” He said before he went back to his warrior.

«Let me know. We are going to head home.” I was done looking at ash.

«Drive safe.” Colt looked over at us and nodded before turning back around.

He seemed a little put off still since he didn’t come give me a hug but he was

looking at his club in ashes. Walking back to the car, my mind kept thinking of all the ways 1 could repay them.

Maybe put crickets in the packhouse or mice. “What are you thinking about?” Alec asked after we got on the road.

“What?” He caught me off guard. Twas picturing Ann screaming from some mice and wasn’t paying attention to what was around me.

“What are you thinking about?” Alec repeated.

“How to get backat Ann.” “What are your ideas?” 1 could see he was trying to have a conversation that wasn’t us arguing but it felt good to talk to him again.

“rermites, bed bugs, mice or crickets.”noveldrama

Alec seemed surprised. “IT haven't even thought about those things.” «What were you thinking about?” Looking over, he had both hands on the wheel as he scanned the freshly fallen snow.

“Rogue attacks, small explosions. Not enough to kill anyone but enough to keep them busy.” «Lets do it all.” Looking back out the window, I was justin a weird mood. “I just want to repay Ann back. Since we don’t know what she is after, I just want to drive her crazy.” “What do you think Nox is going to do?” “No idea. I just remembered Colt had a friend growing up and his mom had

mated with someone from Anthony’ pack and so they moved. His biological dad died in a battle. Maybe he would be able to provide us with some inside information that could help us.” “If we are going to follow Gunther and do our own thing, we will need to figure out what we are going to do with Adalynn and I don’t want to be gone for more than a few days ata time.” “1 agree. I don’t want to be gone from Adalynn that long. Just long enough to make sure Gunther and Zac are doing what they should be doing.” “That’s fair.” “where would they even start?” asked, unsure of how things go.

“phere is that part of town where all

the illegal activities goes on. We should probably start there and see how things go.” «1 don’t see people wanting to help us after what we just did.” Thad a bad feeling about it.

«I disagree. I think they will want to put their own revenge on someone and we are giving them a free out. I'm guessing they will be more than happy to help us out.” Alec looked over at me and smile.

«But what what cost to us?”







###Chapter 0565 

“Kristen. Will you stop fidgeting!” Emmy pulled on my hair as I kept twisting in the chair.

We were currently getting ready for the Winter Ball and not once the last few days has Gunther or Zac got into contact with us. We had no idea what they were doing, who they were doing it with or how they were doing it. The longer it went without contact, the more agitated I was. The chances of see Anthony and Ann tonight were high so [ didn’t want to go in blind.

“I’m sorry. I’m just so anxious.” “I’m trying to pin your hair to the side.

I might just get your head!” Emmy gave me a took as she held up a bobby pin.

“First off, that wouldn't hurt that much and second, why aren’t you more anxious?” Emmy hat as a challenge and pushed the bobby pin into my head. Smirking as I flinched, she stopped hurting me.

“I’ve had longer to deal with anxiety and it isn’t as obvious. Plus, Jasper is taking some of it away.” “Alec is making me feel it all.” Folding my arms, I just sat back and waited for Emmy to be done.

Since my dress was a one shoulder, I had Emmy curl my hair and pin it to the one side in a swoop. She had finished my makeup, keeping it pretty natural but gave me a red lip. I guess with a white dress, the red is key.

Alec and Colt were doing some work and then would come get us so we

could follow each other. The roads were slick as it started snowing again.

At this point, we had a few inches on- the ground already and a few more to come.

Knock! Knock! Knock! “Hello?” Vivian stuck her head in the door and yelled.

“Hey! Come on in!” I yelled back. noveldrama

“Adalynn is in here!” After hearing each shoe fit the floor, the closet door opened and closed before she came into the bedroom.

“She looks so happy!” “She had been playing in here for the good part of an hour.” I was surprised she was happy here. Usually she wants out and to roam around my bedroom.

“Oh wow! I'll take her and get her some supper before bath!” Vivian picked her up and started walking out. “You are amazing. Thank you!” “I am just about finished and then I'll do my hair.” Penny was sitting in the corner and putting on press on nails as we bickered. “How are they looking?” asked her.

“Good!” She held up her hand for me to see. She went with a classic white nail with some silver bands to match her jewelry.

“Love them!” “All done!” Emmy patted my arm for me to get up. “Don’t ruin my master

piece!” “This is your best work yet!” I said as | carefully sat down next to Penny to do my own nails. There were a set of fully black ones that I loved.

“When I’m good, I'm good!” Emmy tossed her hair back and made a big deal of it.

“Just like old times!” Smiling sadly at Emmy, she blew me a kiss.

“It’s better. We know who we are going home with so it makes it so much more fun.” “Shit, I never brought anyone home.” Rolling my eyes, I kept working on my nails.

“Didn’t stop you from making out with people?” There was a pang in my heart as she bypassed Ace’s name.

I still knew I never loved him but he was always there for me. “So did you.” I said instead of the obvious.

“Well, you both were little sluts.” Penny put down the glue and stood up.

“HEY!” I said but I couldn’t help the smile on my face.

Penny walked over to my closet and slipped inside. “I’m just saying. I saved myself completely for my mate.” She yelled out.

“Colt didn’t.” I muttered under my breath.

Emmy busted up laughing as Penny stuck her head out. “What was that?” She narrowed her eyes at me.

«I fucking love you!” Finishing one hand, I started working on the other.

KR/10


“When will Jasper be over?” Penny asked as she retreated.

“Any minute.” Emmy looked at her watch and at the window. “We are getting so much snow.” “I know. Fucking white bullshit ruins my mood.” Looking at my nails, I was ready to get dressed. Penny walked out looking sexy as hell.

“Someone is pulling up.” She said as she walked to the window and looked out.

Wanting to be fully dressed, practically ran to the closet and started dressing. “It’s Jasper!” Emmy sang out.

My heart sank a little but I still got naked and pulled on my dress. It

always gave me so much pleasure to be naked under dressed as it turned Alec on.

“My turn!” Emmy ran in here with her hair still in the curlers but she was already half naked.

“Too bad I don’t have my camera!” I laughed and gave her some privacy.

“Camera for what?” Jasper walked in wearing a black tux with deep blue tie.

“Emmy’s appearance resemebles her life before you.” “What do-" Jasper stopped mid sentance when Emmy walked out in the most amazing midnight blue dress.

“you look fucking amazing!” I said in

shock. How Emmy took he hair down and pinned it back so her back wouldn't be hidden was beyond me.

She was literally in that closet for three minutes.

“My turn!” Penny walked out in her elegant purple dress. She looked like a princess with her hair curled down her back and smokey eye shadow.

“Damn.” I heard Colt behind me.

As I turned, my eyes made contact with Alec. I got the pleasure of watching his eyes run down my body and back up.

“pamn is right.” He muttered as he came up to me. Slipping his arms around my waist.

«Don’t ruin my hard work!” Emmy screamed at Colt and Alec.








###Chapter 0566 

“You look amazing.” Alec reached over and held my hand as we drove to the event center.

“Thank you.” I couldn’t help but drool at Alec in a tux with a white tie to match my dress.

“Looking behind you.” Alec nodded back.

Turning my body, I looked at the back seat and saw a suitcase. “What's this?” “Vivian is staying the night and we are having some alone time at the cabin.

With the snow, it is amazing.” «It will be snowing all night but I'd still take the summer heat.” Turning back, a true smile spread across my

face. “Thank you, I love that, It has been ages since we spent the night out there.” “I even got the hot tub going.” “Is that what you did instead of setting up?” Ilaughed but was very excited for it.

“I set things up...” Alec trailed off as we pulled into the parking lot. There was already people walking into the center. Their gowns were beautiful but they were running to get out of the SNOW.

“I really hope the snow doesn’t cause any accidents.” “Anthony could wreck and I'd be happy.” Alec muttered as he parked in our designated spot. Colt and Penny were right behind us with Jasper and

Emmy in the back. &» r “But I want to kill them with my own hands... or Seirra does anyway.” | muttered as I opened my door. The cold wind whipped at my face and made my dress flare at the bottom.

Not wanting to get it went, I quickly picked it up and ran up the stairs like everyone else to get inside. Alec grabbed my arm and helped me so I wouldn’t fall. My ankle is back to normal but Alec has still been babying it.

The lights were turned down low and the smell of roasted veggies and the beef wellington was making my mouth water. “This looks amazing!” My eyes scanned the room. The black and silver really made it feel wintery. There was diamond rhinestones shining with

snowflakes and Christmas trees of all sizes around the room, “Thank you.” Alec wrapped his arms around my waist and planted a kiss on my neck as everyone else came running inside.

“So cold!” Emmy groaned. After fixing her dress, she walked up beside me.

“You guys did great!” Penny looked around before taking Colt’s arm. They walked in to start mingling with some guest. noveldrama

Alec and I were going to be welcoming our guest in as they came and Jasper and Emmy were going to focusing on making sure things were running smoothly.

Jacob and Sherry were just a few

minutes behind us. I wasn’t sure why but she still put me off a little. | didn’t trust her and it was hard to be around her. Since she never really did anything against us, she was still allowed come to these events. I got the feeling she didn’t like being around us either so that kept Jacob from spending quality time with us.

“Jacob!” On reflect, my arms went out to give him a hug. He accepted it but let go quickly.

“Hey, Ice. How’s it going?” “Been busy. You look beautiful, Sherry.” I said politely. She had on a shimmering black dress. It was spaghetti strap with a straight neck line. The ballgown really hid her figure but she seemed like like it.

“Thank you. I’ve always wanted to

wear a fluffy dress so here I am!” She seemed very anxious and nervous, Sherry’s eyes kept darting around and her smile was very forced.

“Well, head on it. Please enjoy yourself and mingle.” Stepped aside, I let them pass. Jacob had a sadness in his eyes that broke my heart.

For the next hour, more people filtered in from all packs. I had to start asking people where they were from so I knew where they belonged. So far, I was the only person wearing white and that made me so happy. There was a handful of green, reds, blues and a ton of blacks.

I had just finished talking to someone behind me when I heard their voices.

“Don’t you look... interesting.” Taking a deep breath, I put on the best

Se *<0U BONUS smile I could and turned around. Ann was wearing a dull basic white dress. It almost looked like a human wedding dress and not a gown. There wasn’t any sparkle and it looked too young for her.

“Ann! It’s so good to see you. I see when tried for that young look. Not everyone can pull that off, certainly not you!” I laughed like I said a joke.

Alec snorted and put his arm around me. “Anthony. I'm glad you were able to make it.” “rhank vou for the flowers.” He said in a forced politeness.

“It was our pleasure. It's not every day you escape a death sentence and get made a luna!” Hoping my smile met my eyes, my head tilted to the sideina

Sav T

“Oh! I did remember. I even asked the staff to provide a very special meal just for you, Ann. After all, you need to keep that figure if you wanted to keep dressing like a teenager. Please, head on in and mingle. I'm sure there are many people that want to speak with the new couple.” Stepping to the side, I let them pass.

Thankfully, Anthony was between Ann and I and Alec even pulled me back a little so I wasn’t even in arms reach.

“Don’t leave my side.” He whispered

EP EA in my ear.

“I'won’t be.” He wasn’t going to get any resistance from me.

I' watched as Anthony and Ann walked up to Colt and Penny. Ann was already pissed at me but Penny was definitely holding her own.










###Chapter 0567 

“Ice...” Colt walked up behind me and got my attention by nudging me.

Turning, we looked over at him. “Time to start dinner.” The words were barely out of his mouth when the lights flickered, signalling everyone to get to their seats.

Out of pure spite, we did not include Anthony and Ann at the head table with the rest of us. Instead, they were sitting at a table with random pack members to the side of the room. It was away so there wouldn’t be a reason for them to pass our table for anything and we wouldn’t have to pass their table.

“Thank you all for coming!” Colt stood up and started his entry speech.

Everyone immediately stopped whispering, except Anthony and Ann.

“I’m sorry, Luna Ann? I understand you are new to this luna stuff after being in jail for a while but it is rude to speak when someone else is. Would you mind refraining and pay attention? Thank you.” The sweetness from my voice was thick.

Ann looked pissed off that I swear steam was coming from her ears and Anthony was equally annoyed. The room had quiet laughter before Colt got back to his speech. “Tonight, we have beef wellington. If you would prefer a vegan option, just let your server know and they will bring you eggplant spaghetti ora salad. After dinner, we will be moving the tables and having a dance. Drinks will be

served all night until 11pm. Please drink responsibly. I would like to recognize Luna Penny and Luna Kristen for all their hard work in making this possible!” He started clapping and everyone joined in. Penny and I stood up before sitting down again. Colt clapped his hands and the servers immediately brought out carts of steaming hot food.

«1 Jove watching this.” Echo laughed.

She was sitting directly in front of me on the table.

“Watching what?” I said as I sat back for the food to be placed in front of me.

“Alec, can you get me a drink?” I asked quietly.

“I got you, Jack and Dr. pepper?” Colt said and stood up. N

“Yes, please.” “Whiskey?” Colt looked at Alec.” “Yeah, thanks.” Alec nodded.

“Alpha Colt. Stay here. I will be your personal server today. The staff and I had a conversation and we would prefer if everyone stayed here and we will get any drinks while the dinner is being eaten. That way, Luna Kristen won't be left alone.” The server bowed multiple times like he was worried he was going to get into trouble.

“Are you sure?” Colt asked, slightly taken aback.

“Oh yes, we like Luna Kristen and will do it for her.” He bowed one last time before walking off.

«Find out who that is and give him a bonus.” Lifting my eyes at Colt, he

nodded in agreement.

“Like I was saying, I will enjoy this.” Echo repeated herself. Apparently, she wanted to let me know what she was thinking.

“Enjoy what?” I asked. Out of the corner of my eye, I watched Ann glare at me.

“You standing up to Ann. She is pissed and it’s beautiful.” “Stop watching Ann and enjoy yourself.” Alec muttered in our mind- link.

“yes, Alpha.” I replied. I felt the desire run through him but he kept working on his food.

«1 swear I saw her face turn red as a tomato!” Emily added.

“It felt nice.” I had to admit. The server came back with drinks for us. I watched as Colt pulled the server to hirn and handed him a couple hundred dollars.

“I can’t wait. This is going to be the best night we have had in a long time!” Echo laughed out loud.

“Is that so?” Jace looked at Echo and challenged her with a smile.

It was all I could do but not spit my food out as we watched Echo try to get back into his good graces. The jack was going down so smooth that I was happy we didn’t have to drive. Just walk into the woods. I was finished eating and so was Alec so I just leaned back into him.


“Isn’t this cozy?” Ann walked up behind Echo but was looking at me.

Both of our eyes went to the red wine she was holding.

“How was your meal? I hope you found the salad.... editable.” “One step up from dog food but what should I expect from you.” Ann looked at my dress.

Echo stood up quickly, knocking the red wine down Ann’s dress from the back of her head. “I’m so sorry!” Echo faked looking surprised.

“You stupid bitch!” Ann shrieked. Jace stood up, between them as Anthony walked forward.

“What is going on?” He looked at Jace and then at Ann. His eyes traveled down her dress and to her empty cup.

“There was a small accident. I hope

you brought another dress.” Again, the sweetness from my voice was sickening but it was the laugh I. was trying to hide that caught their attention.

“Thankfully, I did bring another.” Ann grabbed her dress and pulled. Echo was standing on it so she was momentarily caught off balance but Jace caught her and planted a kiss like it was intentional.

“1 owe you.” I said as Echo took her seat back.

“It was purely an accident. I have no idea what you are talking about.” Echo acted like she was in fact innocent. The serves came around to collect the empty plates.

“What dress do you think she brought with her?” Emmy asked.

“Will it matter? It will be stained shorty.” Emily stood up. “I need to use the restroom.” Lars and a few others headed off to the bathroom. noveldrama

“Did you not need to go?” Alec asked.

“No.” I pulled his head closer to mine.

“I’m ready to dance.” “Me too.” Alec leaned his head in and breathed in my scent before nibbling on my neck.

“1 have a surprise for you.” I told him before he looked at me in the eyes, confused.






###Chapter 0568 

“What’s that?” Alec asked right as a f slow song came on. Strawberry Wine will always be a favorite of mine to slow dance to so I took his hand and pulled him into the floor.

“You look good tonight, did I tell you that already?” Wrapping my arms around his shoulders, he held me tightly against him. I was vaguely aware of the other alpha and lunas that joined us on the floor.

“You did but I am still waiting to see what surprise you had for me.” Alec whispered.

His hands ran up and down my back.

Pulling his head down, I whispered in his ear. “I'm not wearing anything on under this.”

I it. oh ae Alec didn’t say anything but his hands tightened. His claws gripped my dress and a growl ran up his chest. The desire that shot up him was beyond anything I'have felt for him in a long time.

The moment the song ended, Alec grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the side door. My eyes looked at Ann's empty table right as he pulled me into the hallway.

“Where are we going?” I asked, trying not to laugh.

“Shh.” Alec looked back at me and held his finger over his mouth. There was a look in his eyes that told me all I needed to know.

Grabbing his hand with my free hand, 1 had to practically run to keep up. My heels were loud enough that Alec stopped and scooped me up before he

took off in a jog. Wanting to tease a little bit, I left my own nibbles on his neck.

“Damit, woman.” Alec pushed open a door and closed quicker than I expected. The room was pitch black but Alec had found a wall and shoved me against it.

Between his internal desire and how sexy I found this, we were going at it like this was the last time we were going to be together. While his hands pulled my dress up, I took his belt off.

I'had barely got his zipper down when his finger rammed into me. “Fuck!” I whispered as he jack hammered into me. Alec started nibbling down my neck, making it impossible for form a sentence in my mind.

“I can’t wait.” Alec muttered and pulled out of me. I was trying to wrap my head around what was happening when he grabbed my legs and picked me up. With one motion, he dick entered me.

He wasn’t being slow or showing me any mercy. I had to hold onto his arms and squeeze tightly. The only sounds were our flesh hitting eachother and the grunts coming form Alec.

The only bad part was the door knob that was being rammed into my ass with each thrust. Right when I thought I would get some relief as Alec blew he load, he kept going. My face was numb, my body was tingly but my ass was going to be bruised tomorrow.

Right as the world went back, Alec grunted one last time and slammed his

hand on the wall behind my head. His body pressed against me, keeping me from falling as he leveled out his breathing.

“Good job.” I was just as breathless as I patted his shoulder. “However, the door handle in my ass is really starting to hurt.” A chuckle ran down Alec’s body as he lowered me down. “Sorry about that.” “You can make it feel better later tonight.” I said as Alec pulled up his pants.

“Ready to head back out?” I asked.

Just then, the door to the room opened up. Some light came in and I was able to see Alec’s face. He was confused and had opened his mouth to speak when

-— ag ced we heard who was standing on the other side.

“I found one!” Anthony yelled out.

Alec yanked my arm away from the door behind me and opened it. We had about a second to get inside but we weren't able to close it. Instead, he left it cracked. Holding our breaths, we listened intently.

“That stupid bitch! I can’t wait to see what she thinks of what we have in store for her.” Ann waltzed in and started pacing.

“Will you shut the fuck up? All you have done is draw attention to us! This isn’t how I wanted this to go and I don’t want you to fuck this up. I'm surprised we were even to sneak away from all their eyes!” Anthony was pissed. I knelt down and peaked as Alec

stayed standing. We watched Anthony's back. He was facing away from us and I was getting glimpses of =~ Ann’s new dress.

It was a massive light blue silk ballgown that looked vaguely similar to what I saw the Queen of England wearing not too long ago. Her breast were probably tapped up and her hair was pulled into a high bun.

“I’m sorry but I just want to fuck this night up for her! She doesn’t deserve any happiness.” “I'’know and if you would just stay silent, things will go off perfectly. Just need another hour and we will be able to see things through.” Anthony walked up to Ann and pulled her to him. His hands wrapped around her neck as he planted a kiss. noveldrama

Alittle bit a vomit filled my mouth before they broke away. “Do you think they will see it coming? It’s not like rogues are going to storm the building.” “No. He is too far focused on Kristen to be worried about any security issue.” “That’s good. We just need to make sure we leave just before so we aren’t caught here.” I couldn’t see what she was doing but the sounds of his belt buckle clinking together made my body freeze.

“What a vixen. I knew I chose the right woman for the job.” Anthony growled as I watched his pants fall.

“I'm not wearing anything under this.” Ann said in a sexual voice,

“I'm going to be sick.” I said in the mind-link.

“Please don’t ever say that to me again.” Alec said. We backed away and tried to plug our ears from hearing Anthony and Ann have sex while we hid in the closet. @










###Chapter 0569 

“I already mind-linked Jasper and we are going to figure out what is going on. You need to stay with Colt while I am trying to figure out what Anthony and Ann have planned.” Alec whispered to me.

Anthony and Ann had just walked out of the room. Alec was looking around to see if the coast was clear. “I just need a bucket to throw up in. I am seriously traumatized.” “We can never have sex in front of Adalynn again.” Alec muttered as he grabbed my hand and pulled me out.

There wasn’t a reason to respond as he dragged me back to the party. As soon as we walked in, I immediately spotted Ann standing by herself talking to

some people.

“Ice.” Colt walked up to me. Taking my | arm from Alec, he turned and left quickly and Colt pulled me back to the group.

“Colt, it was horrible.” Closing my eyes, I forced him to stop and look at me.

“I was told.” Colt was trying to hide a smile.

“It’s not funny!” “It’s truly very funny.” Colt grabbed my arm again and pulled me to the group. There was a few obvious men missing but the women were sitting down, talking in a circle with what men were left standing around them in their own conversation.

“Kristen!” Echo immediately started

laughing. noveldrama

Instead of responding, I faked threw up on her dress as I fell dramatically to my seat. “I had tears I was laughing so hard when Jasper told me.” Emmy still had some water in her eyes.

“How nice of a friend are you to tell everyone else my horrors.” Sitting up, I tried to gather as much dignity as I could.

“I knew you needed all the support from the girls.” Emmy closed her eyes and took a deep breath like she was trying to regain her composure.

“Can we go dance? I need to distract me.” Looking around, the dance floor was packed with both girls and guys having fun.

“Stay on the end so we can see you.”

Lars muttered.

It was like a switch and all of us stood up and ran to the dance floor. Staying on the end, we started moving to the beat. Wanting to escape, my eyes shut as I felt each beat to the music. Just letting my body flow as it felt like. My muscles relaxes, all my cares went away.

That was, until I started getting anger from Alec. Whatever he was doing, it was pissing him off. My eyes opened as the song changed but everyone was still just enjoying themselves. Not wanting to draw attention to myself, I just kept dancing.

“Ice, whats that?” Emmy nudged me and pointed upward.

Following where she was pointing, I saw movement on the rafter. “Alec,

where are you?” “Why?” { “There is people on the rafters.” “Fuck!” Reacting on instinct more than anything, I grabbed Colt’s arm. “Jace, you are in charge of Emmy now too.” Not waiting for his reaction, I ripped Colt off the dance floor and into the hallway.

“Leaving so soon?” Her voice forced me to stop right as we started off towards Alec.

“Are you?” My back straightened as we both turned and looked at Anthony and Ann.

“We figured we would turn in early.” Anthony said politely.

[ wasn’t sure what Colt was doing in his pocket but he fumbled with something before he responded. “Cut the crap. There is nothing civil between us.” “You are absolutely correct. I want only bad things for you.” Ann laughed as they got closer.

“Why are you even here?” I asked. It was a burning question I wanted an answer. “You didn’t give two shits about me when we were growing up.” “You were always so ungrateful. You took everything away from me so now it is my life mission to ruin yours. I won't stop until you are on the streets and it starts with the life you built of my money.” “Alec? Are you okay?” I said instantly

in the mind-link.

“So, you admit it. You were the one that destroyed the tattoo shop and the club.” “1 didn’t say anything. Just that I think you got what you deserved.” Ann shrugged. “Why don’t you just go back to the party and we will leave. You can enjoy what is left of your party... while you still can.” “That’s the thing. I feel like you should stick around for awhile.” “Keep her talking.” Alec said back but his voice sounded like he was struggling with something.

“Why would I do that?” “You might miss all the fun that is about to happen.” I put on my sweet voice and my head tilted to the side.

“Fun?” i “Oh yes, you see, Alec and I over heard your conversation and the pathetic attempt of your sex life. I must say, that was a poor performance.” I had the pleasure of watching Ann’s face drop and the color leave a ghostly white face. Anthony was studying me and slightly smirking. “You li-" Ann stepped forward with her hand raised but it was me to beat her to the punch. My body moved on it’s own as it took a step forward, blocked her slap and returned one across her face. It was so loud that it echoed across the hallway.

Colt stepped forward and kept Anthony from doing anything from me. “I'm

bleeding!” “It’s barely cut. Stop acting like a { child.” Rolling my eyes, I took a step back. The fury in her eyes was clear. It felt so good to finally stand up to her.

“Let me get this through your head. I am not a child anymore that you can slap whenever you feel like it. I am a fucking luna and equal to you. I will not lay down and take it. All the anger that built up over the last 18 years is ready to come out so this is your warning.

Leave my family alone and I'll leave you alone. If you don’t, I will use every brain cell I have to make your life a living hell like you did to me. Not even your pack likes you as a luna.”












###Chapter 0570

 Ann was about to say something when | we heard footsteps coming from behind us. There was more than a few people walking towards us. All of us turned and watched as Alec and Jasper walked out with three men being drug by their collars. All of them had blood on this faces but Alec and Jasper didn’t have a single drop.

“I believe these are yours.” Alec said as they tossed them men at Anthony’s feet.

Neither Anthony or Ann spoke for a moment. “We caught them with oil and feathers off the rafters.” Jasper looked deadly.

“If a member of my pack set up a prank, that has nothing to do with

me.” Ann snickered as she kicked their hands away.

“He said you instructed him to do it.” Alec chimed in.

“What are you implying, Alec?” Anthony said Alec’s name in a very condescending tone.

“That you are completely worthless. I suggest you take your pack and leave.

Next time I see you, it won’t be pretty.” “Is that a threat?” Anthony took a step forward.

“It’s a threat, a promise and I'll even give you my word. I won’t be the one on the ground when we are done.” Alec looked absolutely scary but it was so fucking sexy at the same time. His wolf came forward to assert his dominance. noveldrama

“Well, isn’t this cozy.” Ann laughed.

I was so fucking done. It might have been the anger I felt from Alec but I was done seeing her. Walking around Anthony, I grabbed a fist full of her hair and literally drug her to the door.

Jasper, having recognized what I was doing, ran to open it before I got there.

There was too much dress for me to toss her but since there was stairs, I was able to push her to the edge of them. It was as if all the rage from the last 18 years came to the surface and I blacked out. My wolf came forward as she took her hair and tossed her so she rolled down every stair. Hitting each one on the way down.


“ANN!” Anthony screamed as he ran down to help her.

“You are not welcome here. Leave before I do what I really want to do.” My wolf spoke for me.

Ann sat up, her head was bleeding, her arm was at a weird angle and she looked completely out of it. “You could have killed her!” “What a shame I didn’t.” Being over this, I turned and walked back inside.

“Kristen!” Colt came up to me and grabbed me by the shoulders. “You tossed her down the stairs!” His expression was both shocked, concerned and a hint of a smile. “The bitch survived but with all that dress, I’m not surprised. Should have just

ripped her heart out and been done with it.” Colt didn’t say anything but just pulled me into a hug. “Did I go too far?” I asked Alec in the mind-link.

“No because it was Ann but that was quite the emotional response.” My eyes met his even though Colt hadn’t let me go. I wasn’t sorry for tossing her down the stairs but I did regret losing control over my emotions.

“Let’s go back in there and have some fun?” Colt pulled back and looked at me.

Truthfully, I just wanted to go back to the cabin but I didn’t feel like I could leave. “Okay.” I tried to put a smile on as Alec took me from Colt and we walked back inside.

“Just a little longer, love, and then we can go to the cabin.” Alec practically could read my mind at this point.

“Okay.” Was all I could saw as we walked up to the table.

Alec took a seat and put me on his lap.

Jasper picked Emmy up and tossed her over his arm before he sat down. It was the true definition of man handling.

Colt was much more graceful as Penny got up and let him sit down first before she sat on his lap. “I got everyone drinks...” Jace said and pushed some drinks towards us.

“Thank you!” Grabbing mine, I shot it down quickly before taking Alec’s and shooting his down too.

“Damn girl, everything okay?” Echo

asked.

My mouth was full of whiskey that I hadn’t swallowed yet so Colt answered for me. “She tossed Ann down the front stairs.” Emmy spit out the drink she had in her mouth. “Holy shit!” Her cranberry and vodka was running down her chin as Jasper handed her a napkin.

“You did not!” Echo looked shocked.

“I don’t know what happened. I just blacked out and my wolf took over.” Alec patted my leg for me to stand up.

He walked off and I sat back down to keep talking. Hoping he was going to get more drinks. “I’m assuming she lived?” Penny asked.

“Unfortunatly.” Isighed.

“You wish you killed her?” Emily asked.

“I wish I would have just pulled her heart out and fed it to her.” “Damn. Remind me never to get on your bad side.” Echo laughed.

“Well, I am proud of you for handling her!” Emmy declared.

“Oh, I am too! You are scary when upset!” Echo said as her eyes filled with water.

“They were planning on dropping oil and feathers on the party. Alec caught them before they could do it.” Colt said before he took a sip.

“Seriously?” Jace asked as he leaned forward.

“Yup, the oil and feathers got placed in their car while we were talking before Kris tossed Ann out.” Jasper added.

“you did not!” Emmy looked back at him.

“I didn’t. Our warriors did.” He clarified.

Alec came back with two double whiskeys. Setting both down, I got up so he could sit back down. Wrapping his arm around me, he pulled me as tight against him as possible with one arm. The other arm he took his drink and drank half of it.

“How did they get into the car?” Emily asked.

“Broke the windshield.” Jasper shrugged and took a sip.










###Chapter 0571 

“Damn, you're good!” Lars reached across the table and fist bumped Jasper.

“What can I say!” Jasper looked pretty pleased with himself before he took a drink.

“So, what has been going on?” Jace asked in a hushed voice.

“Yeah, we haven't heard shit this last week.” Lars added.

“Nothing yet. We have a few things in play but nothing has been reported.” Alec said. His hand kept rubbing my thigh, making it hard to focus.

“You know, my pack is pretty close to Anthony’s. It might not be a bad idea for you three to come visit us and if

Alec and Kristen want to do some sight seeing... that might not be a bad idea.” Jace said as he took a drink.

“I would love to meet little Adalynn!” Echo smiled warmly at me.

“That will give you some quality parenting classes!” I laughed at Echo’s spark in her eye.

“When are you guys having kids? You been mated for a few years now.” Emily rounded on Echo.

“Probably next year. We have a few more things to check off our bucket list before we bring kids into our lives.” “YES!” Penny practically screamed.

“Do them! Who knows, you might get triplets out of it!” The whole table laughed at Penny’s

face. She was dead serious. “Why don’t you guys come too! I would love to meet the little ones you have been calling the Quads.” Echo tried to stop her laughter.

“I’m curious. Does Adalynn looked like the triplets? I guess she would be their half sister? Is that what the DNA would say?” Emily asked.

“Hey, guys. Do you mind if we sit with you all? Jacob walked up with Sherry around his arm. She looked petrified as she kept her eyes on the floor.

The table got quiet but Penny smiled warmly at them. “Of course. There is an open chair here you can sit at.” Colt moved over to make room for Jacob and Sherry.

“What are you all talking about?”

face. She was dead serious. “Why don’t you guys come too! I would love to meet the little ones you have been calling the Quads.” Echo tried to stop her laughter.

“I’m curious. Does Adalynn looked like the triplets? I guess she would be their half sister? Is that what the DNA would say?” Emily asked.

“Hey, guys. Do you mind if we sit with you all? Jacob walked up with Sherry around his arm. She looked petrified as she kept her eyes on the floor.

The table got quiet but Penny smiled warmly at them. “Of course. There is an open chair here you can sit at.” Colt moved over to make room for Jacob and Sherry.

“What are you all talking about?”noveldrama

Jacob asked. I could hear the nervousness in his voice. Sherry still didn’t look up as she sat down with her hands in her lap.


“Adalynn and the triplets would be considered half siblings. You are correct.” I said looking at Emily.

“Right now, if you put them beside each other, the boys looked identical and there is a strong resemblances of the girls. They looked like maybe fraternal twins or something but still clearly different.” “That’s crazy!” Emily shook her head in disbelief. The tension was slowly starting to fade.

“1 know! I’m excited to see what they look like and act like when they get older. If Elaina got Penny’s personality and Adalynn got Alec’s.... well that will

be a fun parenting time.” “Oh shit! Adalynn will get Elaina into so much trouble!” Echo laughed.

“I think we should create some distance between us...” Penny avoided eye contact with me as she took a drink but was smiling.

“Oh shit! Family drama!” Emily sang.

“1 would like to see you try to keep Adalynn away if she get's Alec’s personality.” Jace was stone cold serious.

“Shit.” Colt shook his head and looked at Alec. “Hopefully the boys get my personality and then it won’t matter.” “Those boy have to keep those girls in line so they better get your

personality.” Alec muttered.

“However, Adalynn will be extremely watched...” “If she has my personality, how do you expect to keep an eye on her. lama free spirit that cannot be tamed!” Looking back, I batted my eye lashes at him. “Besides, I heard you were quite the playboy and Adalynn will NOT be like that.” “Who said I was a playboy? That was fuck face over here.” Alec looked appalled but completely tossed Jasper under the buss.

Jasper’s mouth dropped open. He had put his hand over his heart and was about to protest his innocence when he was interrupted. “Don’t be shocked.


Even I knew that!” Emmy looked at him like he was stupid.

Jace and Lars busted up laughing. “I wouldn’t laugh boys. I have it on good authority that you two weren’t innocent either!” Echo rounded on them.

“I bet Colt never told you shit!” Jace challenged Echo.

“Bros before-" “Don’t finish that statement.” Penny put her hand over his mouth.

The whole table was laughing, even Jacob and Sherry. “So, Sherry. What have you been up to?” Emily asked, nicely.

“Oh, um. I have been doing mostly self healing things. I got into yoga and been eating healthy.” She said very timidly.

“She has been writing letters to those

who have wronged her and we held a burning ceremony. By putting everything she had endured and felt or the paper, she let it all go when she put it in the fire. This is the next step we are working on. Getting back into mingling and building relationships.

So, we decided it was a good time to join the table and make that next step.” Jacob said. I wasn’t sure if Sherry wanted him to share all that. By the blush that crept across her cheeks, she was a little embarrassed.

“That is incredibly healthy way to go about it! I am so proud of you.” Emily said, nicely.

“I agree. With the trauma you have lived, you have to start somewhere and it sounds like you and Jacob are making good progress.” Echo nodded in approval.

«rhank you. It might take me awhile to get comfortable but I would like to be a friend to you all... if you would let me.” Sherry was looking up but still avoided eye contact.

Alec didn’t trust her and I could tell Colt didn’t really either. It would take quite awhile for her to win their trust back. She might not had lied directly but omission in their eyes is lying.

“That would be lovely. One person could never have too many friends.” Penny said.

Jacob looked at me as picked up my drink and downed the rest of it. “I'm going to go grab another one. Does anyone need one?” IL asked, standing up.

«11 come with you.” Alec muttered.

“If you don’t mind, I'll go with her.” Jacob asked Alec. /










###Chapter 0572 

“Is that okay?” Alec mind-linked me. noveldrama

The whole table, froze as they looked between us. “Yeah. I'm good.” I was more curious what he had to say.

Alec sat back and relaxed his body.

“Okay.” Jacob waited for me to walk around before he fell into step neck to me. We walked in silence the whole way but I could always feel Alec’s eyes on my back. The line for the drinks was longer and since Jacob wanted to talk, I decided we would just wait it out.

“I’m sorry I haven’t been around much.” Jacob said quietly. There was almost an ashamed tone to his words.

“You have been busy.” I wasn’t sure what he wanted me to say but I wasn’t sure what exactly he was sorry for, either.

“I know but I haven’t been that great of friend to you. I haven’t been there to help you.” “You're here now.” This was getting a little awkward.

Jacob shuffled his feet a little bit before he kept going. “I did want to apologize but I’m really here on Sherry’s behalf.” That caught my attention. “Why so?” “She would like to make amends. She feels responsible and it’s part of her healing to address all those who she

feels like she betrayed or hurt. Would you be willing to come over and spend an evening with us?” = I wasn’t sure what to say to that. Alec and I have emotionally cut her out of our lives, and in extension, Jacob too. I wasn’t going to lie that I didn’t miss his friendship but I had a new life.

“What can I get for you?” The bartender snapped me out of my thoughts.

“Two whiskey doubles, please.” The bartender looked at Jacob.

“Whiskey on the rocks, please.” “Coming right up.” “Listen, Jacob. We will come. I miss your friendship but I can’t promise anything. Alec has some really strong

feelings about it all.” “I'm sure but if it is all the same to you, we would like to try. Even if the only things that comes out of it is Sherry checking this box.” The bartender handed us our drinks.

“Remember the old day would you brought that random girl named Candy to the table we were sitting at?” Jacob snorted. We walked to the side but didn’t make our way back to the table. “Simpler times, for sure. The thing is, I have been doing my own soul searching and I think the Moon Goddess was laughing when she put me with Sherry.” “Why do you say that?” I had my own ideas but it would be nice to hear it from him.

“She thought I was a terrible man so she put me with a damaged girl, knowing that being a mate would make me have to help her. In doing so, she made me a better man. All those women I used... I know I didn’t do anything that Sherry was put through but I didn’t exactly treat them correctly. Sherry is making me a better man and I’m helping her through her troubles.” I didn’t think I could get anymore surprises but Jacob did it. “Look at you growing up!” I teased.

“Yeah, yeah. Let’s head back.” Jacob rolled his eyes but blushed a little.

“Sounds good. Just call me with a date.” Jacob just nodded in return as we made our way back to the table. Alec held

open his arm for me to slide into before wrapping around me tightly again.

Bringing my drink to my lips, I spared a glance over at Sherry and Jacob. He had placed her back on his lap and was whispering something in her ear.

“What was that all about?” Alec asked in the mind-link.

The table was laughing at Jasper’s dance moves at the moment so it allowed me to just sit back and talk to Alec. “Jacob wants us to come over and talk with them. Sherry wants to personally talk or apologize or whatever she is calling it. She wants to make amends. As part of her therapy and to start working her way back into our group.” “Why didn’t Sherry ask you that?” Alec wasn’t exactly happy about this.

“I’m not exactly delicate with my words and she probably was too scared to ask. Jacob also apologized for not being around.” “Yes, you have a dirty mouth.” Alec was done talking about this and was changing the subject.

“Oh! I love this song! Let’s dance!” Echo jumped up and ran off without waiting for anyone. Jace got up and followed her out there. Everyone else followed, even Jacob and Sherry.

“Don’t want to dance?” Alec asked since we were the only ones at the table.

“Not particularly.” Turning around, I wrapped my arm around his neck.

Alec studied my eyes. “What's on your mind?”

“1 think that will be good to visit Jace and Echo. We can leave Adalynn there and do what we need to do.” “I’m not going to lie, it will be fun to give them hell with you. However, if we do this, you need to promise me you will listen and not put yourself in unnecessary risks. This whole thing could be very dangerous and I don’t want you getting hurt... again.” “you need to accept the fact that most of that was not my fault and unless you wanted me to tuck tail and run, I'm going to fight.” I felt very strongly about this and it was something Alec disagreed on.

“Not running but not engaging either.” “If I didn’t engage, you would be dead right now.” I pointed out. Kissing his

nose, I gave him a sweet smile.

Alec just rolled his eyes at me. “I think maybe we need to do a training session tomorrow and whoever wins gets to call the shots.” Alec’s eyes glanced down at my lips before going up to my eyes.

“That’s not fair since I haven’t trained in ages.” “Are you saying you are too weak or just admitting that I am going to win?” “Never!” The fight was on. “Let’s go to the cabin and I'll show you how dominate I can be.” I whispered in his ear.










###Chapter 0573 

“I think we are going to head out.” Alec said once everyone came back to our table.

“Ah! Really? Wse sare havfing sso much ffun!” Echo slurred.

“Sounds like you need to head home too!” I laughed at her trying to speak correctly. She was mouthing each word as if try to not slur but it was just making it worse.

“Maybe we should head back too.” Jace shook his head but laughed at her.

“Night is still young! I'm not ready to give up yet!” Emmy exclaimed and ran back out to the dance floor with Jasper.

“Me either!” Penny laughed and pulled

Colt out to the dance floor.

“I'm ready for bed.” Emily yawned. noveldrama

“This is way past our bedtime.” “It’s like 11:00 pm.” Jacob looked at his watch.

“We need our beauty rest.” Emily stuck her tongue out at Jacob.

“I wouldn’t mind going home too.” Sherry said quietly. She looked up at Jacob. The smile he gave her didn’t reach his eyes and his shoulders showed his disappointment.

“If you are ready, we can leave.” He tried to make it sound like it wasn’t that big of a deal. Downing the rest of his drink, they stood up, allowing everyone else to follow.

I watched her mouth, ‘thank you’ to Jacob before we all headed towards the

door. By this time, others were starting to leave as well, making it a little more crowded out front. The front steps all had females waiting on their dates to bring the car around.

With all the fresh powder that has accumulated, Alec just picked me up bridal style and carried me to the car.

“My strong man.” I whispered in his ear.

Alec rolled his eyes but I felt the humor inside of him. “Really?” “Can we start a fire?” “Of course. I already planned for that and have wood in the fireplace.” “You’re amazing.” Alec was able to open the car door and place me inside so didn’t touch a single snow flake unless it had landed

on me. A shiver ran up my spine as Alec got in. I was able to see Jacob get into his car before we pulled out. We made eye contact was we left our parking spot for a brief second before he was out of eye sight.

“Do you really think she is going to change?” Alec muttered. He was so skeptical that I doubted he would actually listen to her.

“She doesn’t have anything to hide anymore. She was ashamed of her past and didn’t want us to find out. It wasn’t that she was trying to hide information but hide what happened to her. I remember a time I didn’t want to tell you about Ann because of what you were going to think.” “There is a huge difference.” Alec retorted.

Not wanting to argue about it tonight, | let it go. Besides, we pulled into our cabin. Alec had light on that were on the walk way and one in the livingroom. “This is so beautiful at night.” I whispered as he turned off the car.

“It is. I'll grab our bags if you want to head inside.” Alec said and pushed the trunk button.

“Alright.” That meant I had to walk in multiple inches of snow but I was going to be taking my shoes off anyway. The way my foot fell into the snow was so cold and wet that I started to run up the ramp.

[ was about half way when something caught my eye. There was a void in the snow. Bending down, I started


examining it before it hit me what it was. Looking ahead, there was a trail.

“Kristen, what are you doing?” Alec came up behind me.

“There are footsteps on the ramp, leading inside.” Alec kneeled down beside me and looked at the indents. “Stay here.” He said quietly and gave me our bags.

I was left in the cold as Alec quietly walked to the front door. Looking in the windows, I watched his body relax before waving me forward. “Who is it?” I asked as I got closer.

Alec was holding the door for me, very clearly annoyed. He just motioned for me to go inside, which T'was thankful for. As soon as I stepped inside, I saw

Gunther standing by the fire place. He had started it and was just enjoying the heat.

“We have an office.” I was annoyed now too.

“I’m keeping a low profile and that doesn’t mean walking into your packhouse.” Gunther stood up but stayed by the fire. His clothes were damp and I realized he was trying to warm up.

“What are you doing here?” Alec asked as I took our bags and walked to the bedroom. I wanted to change and I knew Alec kept clothes here that I could exchange with him so I could put his in a dryer.

Thankfully, I packed some shorts and a fitted tank. After hanging up my dress, [ walked out to the boys again. “Here.

Wy TI RUWNS You can change and I'll put your clothes in the dryer.” “Oh... um..” Gunther looked down at his clothes and at me.

“Just go.” He didn’t argue after that but took the clothes and walked to the bathroom. “What does he want?” “To give an update. I told him to wait for you.” Sitting down on the couch, I just grabbed a blanket and curled up. Alec walked to the bedroom to change his clothes. I was alone for just a few moments before Gunther came out.

Getting up, I took his clothes and put them in the dryer without a dryer sheet. Judging by the clothes, he wasn’t in a position to be smelling like

lilacs.

Alec met me as I was walking back to the livingroom. Gunther had resumed his spot by the fire. “So, what was SO important you wanted to tell us now, instead of just calling us?”











###Chapter 0574 

“I do still have some contact that aren’t exactly happy with me but they hate Anthony more. Ann has decided to mess with his business affairs so they were happy to do shit. On top of that, I offered some rogues some money to attack their pack tonight and if they survived after doing a few things, they would get a bonus.” “So, what have you accomplished?” I asked. I had resumed my spot with a blanket and Alec had sat beside me.

However, he was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees.

“I'm sure you know what Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs are?” Gunther asked Alec. “What a Kharpa Beetle is?”

“I know what the Stink Bug is.” Alec confirmed.

“Tdon’t...I mean I do know what a stink bug is but what does that have to do with anything?” “They are highly invasive and reek havoc on their farm. It will ruin their crop.” Alec told me.

“Correct. The beetle thrives in grain bins and is on a quarantine list. If they find it, everything will be shut down.” “Where did you find all these?” Alec asked.

«you can find anything if you know where to look. The rogues Were able to distract the guards while I made my way to their farm land. Their job was to get close to the house and release

termites on their foundation.” Damn.” I was so happy and impressed.

This is playing the long game but I think it will benefit us in the long run. I have more I am going to do but this is the beginning.” Gunther shrugged.

“What else do you have planned?” Alec asked. He didn’t leave room for Gunther to refuse to answer.

«I have more rogues that are organizing an attack. My guy is looking at what other insects he can get his hands on. In the mean time, there are a few people that will be messing with the heater and air conditioner in the pack house.” “phat’s good. It’s a stal t.” I said asl took it all in.

-— bet “Anthony hasn’t put the fear in them the way you have so it's been easy to organise it.” Gunther shrugged like it ! was no big deal.

“Have you ate anything?” I asked.

Gunther looked at me confused for a moment before he answered. “Yeah. I did.” He opened his mouth a few times before closing it.

“Just ask or say what you want to.” I “The person you are here is not the person you were in the office.” «I have many talents.” Smiling slyly at him, I heard the dryer buzz.

standing up, I made my way into the Jaundry room. “Ghe isn’t one that you want to cross.” Alec said as soon as | had opened the dryer. A smile came to

my face. Grabbing his pants, I went to walk back but I stopped.

Digging in his pockets, I pulled out a few receipts. One was for a pet store.

He had bought a handful of mice. The next one was for a hotel. Slipping my phone out of my pocket, I took a picture of it before shoving them back into his pocket. noveldrama

“Here are your clothes.” Laying them on the couch, I got back under the blanket.

“Thank you.” Gunther took them and went to the bathroom. As soon as he came out, I got a glimpse of the clothes [ let him wear were folding on the counter.

«Can I return home tomorrow and see Kara?” Gunther asked.

Wy TV eave “Are you traveling by foot?” Alec asked.

“Tam.” We looked at his combat boots as he tied them around his pants. “Come on.

I'll drive you.” Alec stood up and walked to the door.

Gunther looked alarmed at me before looking over at Alec. “I can walk...” “Not in this weather.” Alec had his boots on and came over to me. “The hot tub is ready to go. Ill be backin a few hours. You don’t have to wait up.” He said before he kissed my forehead.

“Drive safe.” Twas extremely disappointed but there wasn't anything | could do about it Alec needed to dr ive Gunther. We couldn't

just send him out in this weather. It was the right thing to do.

They walked out and shut the door behind them. I waited until I heard his car drive off before I moved. There wasn’t a reason to wear a bathing suit so I grabbed a towel and got naked.

Alec was right. The hot tub was ready.

The lid was pulled back and the snow made a beautiful view. I wasn’t sure how long I laid there, but my body thoroughly massaged.

[ heard some rustling in the leaves that sent off warning bells. I wasn’t sure why but I decided it was time to get out. Trying to act normal as possible, I turned out all the lights and headed towards the bedroom. Grabbing some sweats and a t-shirt, | started looking around. It had only been an hour and

Alec would just be dropping Gunther off.

There was a 9mm hand gun under the night stand. Right as I reached down to grab it, a shadow ran across the room. I expected my fingers to feel cold steel but it was gone. The only thing that greeted my fingers was leather that was unsnapped.

Grabbing my phone off the top of my bed, I dialed Alec’s number.

Thankfully, he answered it on the first ring. “I’m on my way back, love.” “The gun is gone and something is outside.” I whispered. I didn’t have any lights on but I heard the power shut down. The alarm clock that was reflecting off the T.V. went out.

«pm coming! Can you make it to the safe room?”

The sound of his engine speeding greeted my ears but it was broken glass that really caused my wolf to come forward. “No. Some glass broke. I think they are inside.”














###Chapter 0575 

“Don’t engage! Stay hidden!” I'couldn’t hear anything but g everything in me told me they were inside. “Alec, be realistic. They will find me. I have no choice but to fight.” “I’m coming.” “Okay.” I whispered. Tossing the phone under the bed, I got up and moved to stand behind the door. The floor board creaked just outside of the door. The element of surprise was the only thing that I had going for me.

Sierra came forward. She didn’t fully shift but she did extend her claws out.

As soon as the shadow of a man was just inside the door, she jumped

around and shoved her claws into his chest. He had about three seconds to look into the whites of my eyes before his eyes looked down at his own heart.

His body dropped to his knees, making it clear there was another person behind him.

“SHIT!” He yelled as Sierra swiped at him. She got his jugular, making blood spray around the room.

“FUCK!” He cried as he kept moving around until he finally fell to the ground.

It was key to stay in this room and not allow they to surround me. The third guy came in swinging, making Sierra go on the defense. As he came around with his leg, Sierra took a step back.

However, the step was right on the dead man’s arm and she fell off

| balance.

“Damit!” I'said as he lunged forward > and fell on top of me. He was fat and heavy. The smell of bacon grease, tobacco and sweat made me want to gag.

She kept my forearms in front of my face to keep from getting any blows but a few landed on my kidneys. It wasn’t until another figure came in cause Sierra to have enough.

A wave of power ran through my veins as Sierra shifted into her form. “NO!” The man in top of me was tossed back and through a window.

“Give me that!” Sierra looked over just in time to see something shiny getting passed around.

“Sierra! Run!” I screamed but she had

already taken off. We weren’t sure how many more men there was but Sierra was massive and being trappedina bedroom with a gun wasn’t ideal.

Shots ran out as she jumped through the window. A piece of glass scraped against her shoulder but it was the burning hot pain in her thigh that told me we got shot.

However, she kept going. She knew where she was going and that was down to the road to hopefully run into Alec. A few more shots flew by us until only the sounds of her paws going threw the snow filled out ears.

“Don’t stop! The blood is leaving a trail.” Sierra looked back once. If it wasn’t for the blood, she would blend it perfectly.

We might have had a chance to hide

and do a sneak attack.

Pushing the pain out of our minds, 5 Sierra was in full speed. She was faster than any rogues or even faster than warriors. It wasn’t a worry they would catch her but she needed back up.

After what felt like hours, she finally slowed down to look at her leg. The bullet was still in there and the bleeding had slowed. Shoving ice from a tree in the hole, she was able to keep the blood from flowing more. Staying alert, Sierra tried to clean a little before her ears perked up.

“We need to move.” I wasn’t sure why I whispered but Sierra had the same idea. She got up and started running again.

“KRISTEN!” Alec’s sweet voice filled my head, making me whimper in relief.

“Alec! We are running in the woods, p Where are you?” “Driving. Get to the road!” ‘ “I've been shot in the thigh!” “Damit, woman!” “Technically Sierra got shot.” I felt her amusement and annoyance but she was happy her mate was near.

“They are still coming.” Sierra cut from the trees right as Alec’s car came into view. She collapsed on the pavement, shifting back into our human form. She couldn’t fit into his car so she was forced to let me take the lead.

Alec skidded to a stop as I tried to stand. “Hurry!” I cried out as he came

up to me and picked me up.

“Our warriors are on their way here.

I'm taking you to a hospital.” Putting me in the passenger seat, Alec came around and slammed his door shut, Alec turned around and sped off as a dozen men came out from the tree line.

“I thought we had a bigger lead.” “Can’t run as fast with a bullet in your leg.” Alec grabbed a shirt and pressed it against my wound. noveldrama

“Shit!” He didn’t let up so I reached over and turned up the heater. “I think our white carpet is ruined.” “You left your fucking phone on. I had to listen to you fight.” “Would you rather I hung up on you and you would have been in the dark?” My teeth started clattering.

Alec looked over at my lips and hands before turning the heater on high.

“You need to get warm.” mm | “I'think I'm going into shock...” It was all T could get out before the world started spinning. My heart started beating really fast.

“Don’t pass out! Stay with me!” Alec growled. “That’s a command! Stay awake!” It took everything me to me stay half awake. My head fell against Alecs arm.

It was like I was watching my life happen and nothing I could do about it.

The hospital lights illuminated just how blood stained the shirt was.

Why there was a gurney waiting for me was beyond my comprehension. Alec had to keep my body from flying forward as he slammed in the breaks. I

was vaguely aware of being pulled out of the car and taking inside.

“I love you.” I said in the mind-Tink before blackness took over. :









###Chapter 0576

 The nurses kept me from going back past the double doors. Kristen's voice echoed in my head as she told me she loved me before she passed out. It was like she was incapable to staying out of trouble. Mentally, I knew this wasn’t her fault but I was tired of seeing her hurt. I was emotionally ready to break from time and time again thinking I might lose her.

Grabbing my phone, I dialed Vivian.

Thankfully, she picked up on the second ring. “Hello, Alpha Alec. I wasn’t expecting to hear from you.” “Kristen was just attacked at our cabin.

Are you guys okay?” “Oh dear! Yes, we are perfectly fine.”

“Good. I want you to get Adalynn and go into the panic room. Shut and Tock the door. Don’t come out until I get you out. I'm just being cautious but I need to know you both are safe.” “Yes, Alpha. I'm headed there now!” Vivian said instantly before she hung up on me. I had the security cameras on my phone so I was able to make sure they got there before I looked around the property. After a quick glimpse, it appeared to be okay.

Next was Jasper. “We are just getting here. So far it looks like they abandoned ship. Men are chasing their steps in the snow. Alec, they took the bodies.” “What do you mean?” I asked.

pinching the bridge of my nose, I sat

down and tried to keep ahold of our bond. It wasn’t faulting so it was easy to do.

“I see a heart and the blood splatters on the wall tell me there are at least two if not more dead but there aren’t | any bodies.” | “Mother fucker. Get samples of the blood for DNA.” “Already done.” “Get someone watching my house to make sure we are attacked there. I have Vivian and Adalynn in the panic room.” “Already did that too. They should be there soon if not already there.” “Call me with any updates.” I said before I hung up on him.

Next was the phone call I was dreading.

It felt like I always gave him bad news.

IT took four rings but he finally.

answered in a sleepy voice. “Hello?” “We have a problem. I'm at the Mountain Ridge Hosptial. Kristen was shot but will be okay. It was in the thigh.” «The fuck?” Colt sounded wide awake now. noveldrama

«What's wrong?” I heard Penny asked in the background.

«I don’t want to say too much over the phone. I can either call you when we leave or you can get your ass here.” “I'm on my way.” Colt said.

“Make sure your house and your guards are on high alert. I would advice

penny and the kids getting to a safe room.” There was a pause before Colt talked.

“Okay.” Click! Looking at my phone, I saw the call was ended. Opening up the app for my security cameras, I saw my men were standing guard now. They had night vision binoculars and were scanning the area.

The best part of the cameras was the voice to talk feature. Hitting speak, I was able to talk to them. “You can go inside. They are in a safe room. Stay warm, take rotations to make sure no one is outside.” My warrior jumped about a mile in the air before he looked up at the cameras.

He shook his head and went inside after yelling something out to someone

else. Next was to let Vivian know there were guards in the house, not intruders. — Me: There are guards stationed around the house and inside. Stay in the panic room, all you need is in there.

Vivian replied okay within seconds.


Now it was a fucking waiting game.

Standing up, I started pacing around.

This was the worst part. T knew she was going to be okay. Our bond was as strong as ever but it hurt to see her hurt.

The girl I first met was indestructible.

The fact she managed to kill at least two men was huge. Not to mention that she was aware they were there to begin with. I was proud as hell at the progress she has made by working on opening up to me. Allowing her

emotions to come to the surface. The connection we have is the strongest it has ever been. = “Alec.” Colt’s voice shocked me. I hadn’t realized it had been a full hour since we hung up.

Nodding for him to come to the corner, I started telling him everything. “We were going to the cabin.” Colt nodded.

He was aware of the cabin, even though Kristen didn’t know that.

“When we got there, Gunther was there. He told us a basic update of what he had done and his plans on moving forward. He asked if he could visit Kara since he has accomplished something.

Gunther was on foot and soaked head to toe. Kristen dried his clothes but we weren't going to let him walk in this weather back to your pack. So, I gave him a lift. As soon as I dropped him off,

Kristen called me and told me there were men in our cabin. She must have put the phone down because I listened to her fight before glass shattered.

Eventually, we were close enough that we could mind-link and I got her here.

Jasper is already at the cabin with warriors. He said by the blood splatter and the heart on the floor, there are at least two dead but no bodies. They are following the trail but no update yet.” “Who all knew you were going to be at the cabin?” “Just you, me, and Jasper. Kristen didn’t even know until today.” «There are only two options. We either have a mole or Gunther is working both sides again.” Gunther’s face flashed before my eyes.

The look of surprise when I told him I was going to drive him was real. “How did Gunther know we were going tobe at the cabin?”











###Chapter 0577 

“It’s likely he could be the mole.” Tt wasn’t like it surprised me but there was a part of me that hoped he would have turned his life around after everything he had been through.

“I think it would be a good idea to take up Jace’s offer and do some of your own recon.” Colt folded his arms over his chest and looked at me.

“Kristen and I had already agreed to go. She will be pissed I am leaving her behind.” “I’11 go with you. Jacob can take over for a few days and I assume Jasper will be fine as well.” Not that I minded but there was little room for argument.

Plus, it would be smart to go with someone, At least this way, I wouldn't

be worried about Kristen's safety and she would be around to take care of Adalynn.

‘Jaspers’ good.” “Shit, I would bet Jace would want to tag along.” “More man power.” My voice trailed off as I saw the doctor come into the waiting room. We made eye contact and I immediately walked around Colt to talk to him.

“We got the bullet out. Nothing major was damaged. She has a strong wolf so she should heal within a week but I would say no weight for 24 hours and them weight as tolerated.” The doctor whispered quietly so only we could hear.

“Can I see her now?”

“Sure... you are?” The doctor looked over at Colt. “We have a strict family visiting hours.” “I’m her twin brother.” Colt said in a rather unnecessary aggressive tone.

“Alright.” The doctor didn’t give Colt a second glance as he turned and pushed open some double doors. Colt and I towered over most of the staff, making everyone turn and look at us as we passed.

Everything was white and smelled like beach and alcohol. Sterilization was more annoying to my nose than anything else. The floor was white tile, the walls were another shade of white and even the rails on the walls were white. The only thing of color was the scrubs the staff wore and that was

random. &» “Here you go.” The doctor stopped walking and pointed to a room.

“Visiting hours are over so please stay in the room unless you are leaving.” He didn’t wait for a response before he walked away.

Opening the door, Kristen had her eyes closed and the lights were low. Only a nurse was in the room, checking her vitals. “She is still sedated. However, she should be waking up within the hour.” “Thank you.” I said before I pulled up a chair to her bedside. Colt stayed standing at the end of her bed.

“Let me know if you need anything.” The nurse bowed before walking out of the room.

“Let's get past the 24 hour period and then we can go to Jace’s. The quicker we move on this the better and if we wait to long, Kristen will fight with us on going.” “Probably right. She is incredibly stubborn and nothing will be changing that.” Reaching up, I took her hand in mine and rested my head against hers. It was more to calm me than anything. I knew she was going to be okay so it wasn’t as touch and go as last time. However, I was done being in a hospital.

“At this point, you might just build a hospital between our packs.” Colt tossed the idea out there.

“What did you ever do with the casino?”

“We have all the names switched over and Penny as completely cut ties with the Alpha title. She wanted to do itin private because of the pain. She wants to hold girl camps so she is organizing that. Come this summer, there will be stuff going on there.” “Alec?” Kristen groaned as her eyes started to flutter.

“1'm here.” The chair about flipped back since I stood up so quickly. “How are you feeling?” “High.” It took her a little bit but she finally got her eyes open. She looked at me before realizing Colt was in the room. “Hey, bro.” “Why do you keep ending up ina hospital?” Colt interrogated.

“This was not my fault! I didn’t seek

out a fight.” Kristen glared at me.

“I know. I'm glad you made it out alive.” “My poor cabin.” Kristen looked around.

“What do you need?” I asked, confused.

“A drink.” Colt walked around to the other side of the bed where a cup with a straw was sitting on the end table. “Here.” Colt held it up to her lips. After a quick sip, she pulled her head away. “How bad is it?” “Not bad at all. Nothing was damaged.

No weight for 24 hours and then as little as possible but about a weeks worth of recovery.” Not fully what the

doctor said but close enough.

Colt glanced at me but didn’t correct me. “Well shit. How many did I end up killing?” This time, it was my turn to shift uncomfortably. “Well, we are thinking two or more.” “you are thinking? Did you not go to the cabin?” Kristen tried to sit up more. Colt pushed the buttons, helping her sit up.

“We did but there wasn’t any bodies.

Only thing we found was a heart and a lot of blood.” I could see the realization on her face sink in. “So, we don’t know if they were rogues or warriors from Anthony’s pack?” “Not right now but we will do blood

testing to see if we can figure who they were out.” “They attacked me. In our home!” I could feel the hysterics starting to rise in Kristen. She looked around at Colt for help but he just looked at her. I did what I could and pushed calming emotions in her.

At one point, I worried she was going to push it down and bury it but after watching her take a deep breath with her eyes closed, I thought she was going to be able to come out of this. noveldrama

That was, until her eyes opened and I saw her wolf.













###Chapter 0578 

As soon as my hand touched her cheek, her head relaxed into me. I watched as her eyes closed and her emotions were starting to level out but the anger was still there. It took some time but eventually she was able to open her eyes again and they were back to normal.

«What are we going to do about this?” She asked. The restraint in her voice was clear.

“you are on a 24 hour no weight so | am going to take you home and we are going to relax under a guard. Then, Colt’s family and our are going to Jace’s pack. You can heal with their help and Colt and I are going to go see what Gunther is up to.”

“How convenient that I am stuck home with a bullet wound when we decide to go to Jace’s pack for undercover work:” Kristen pushed my hand away and folded her arms. If Adalynn pouted this way, I would die laughing.

“Nothing is convenient about your pissy ass when you are bed ridden.” Kristen looked both shocked and disgusted at me. “I ley!” “He isn’t wrong.” Colt added.

«The fuck? Why are you here if you aren’t going to be on my side?” «Who's idea do you thinkit was?” Colt raised an eyebrow at her.

«1 hate you both.” The sheer stubbornness of this woman surprised me, even after all this time together.

Colt ruffled up her hair. “We love you!” Kristen slapped away his hand as a nurse walked in. “I see you are awake.

How are you feeling?” «Had better days. Can I go home?” “you need to stay the rest of the night but I'll get papers to you guys first thing in the morning.” The nurse hung up another bag of fluids. “Do you want any pain meds?” “1f I'm going to be stuck here than I do.” Kristen rested her head back on the bed and looked up at the ceiling.


“Figured. I have them here.” After shooting in some white medicine, the nurse looked at Kristen's leg. The

wound looked rough but it didn’t appear to have any infection. “This is for you.” I felt a nudge and looked over. She had a zip lock bag in her hands and was pushing it on me. I was so confused until I looked at the bag and ithad a bullet in it. “Um..” «We wrote it down as ice sickle stick so no police were called. Figured you would want it and so did the doctor.” «pamn. Thank you.” I did want it but it hadn’t even occurred to me to ask for it.

«Of course.” She nodded before walking to the door. “Let me know if you need anything. The call light is tied to the rails.” She smiled at Kristen before walking out.

“How are you feeling?” Colt asked.

“Better now.” Kristen's eyes were starting to flutter.

Colt chuckled as he leaned down and kissed her forehead. “I’m going home.

Let me know when you leave.” “gShhure.” Kristen slurred before she completely passed out.

“Keep me updated.” Colt waved as he walked to the door.

“Here. You take it and get it tested. I won't be able to as quickly as you can.

Get to Gunther before he takes off.” Colt took the bullet from me and nodded.

“Oh, Gunther will be very much aware of what happened.” Colt said as he was half way out of the door.

As soon as Alec was gone, I just went over and laid down on the rock solid couch. Nothing about this was comfortable but I wasn’t about to leave this room.

I had just gotten to sleep when the door opened. The nurse tried to be quiet but she came in with a pillow and blanket for me. After checking Kristen’s vitals, she left quietly.

Since I didn’t need the blanket, I used it to put some separation between me and whatever was poking me in the back. Once again, I was just about asleep when I heard Kristen call out.

“Alec!” My body instantly woke up as if there was a threat around us. As quietly as could, I walked up to her. Kristen was

tossing her head around as if she was having a bad dream.

“Shhh.” Being as gentle as I could, I laid on the edge of the bed. Kristen curled into me, resting her head on my chest. I don’t care where we are at, whenever she does that, my heart melts. “Sleep. I got you.” I whispered to her. It didn’t take long for my arm to go to sleep and for me to follow right after.

Kristen's fingers were tracing my face, making my beard itch. “Why must you always do that to wake me up?” “you like it.” The door to the room opened up and the nurse stuck her head in. “Good morning! I got papers. How are you feeling?”

It took me a second to get off the bed with only one arm. The other was so dead that I couldn’t even lift it up. My shoulder didn’t want to work as I moved to the side so the nurse could look at Kristen.

“Ready to be in my own bed.” «1 bet.” The nurse handed Kristen the papers before she lifted the bed sheets and looked at her thigh. “This looks pretty good.” Laying the sheets back down, she took the papers from Kristen and laid them on the table. noveldrama

“Here is some scrubs you can wear since you came in naked and a wheel chair for you.” “Thank you.” “Would you like to bring your car around and we can meet you out front?” 1 wasn’t looking at the nurse

but I did after that question. I wasn’t sure why but it irked me she even asked that. = My eyes glanced at Kristen. She nodded, giving me the okay. “Sure.” Before I walked out of the room, I opened the mind-link up. “Don’t close this.”










###Chapter 0579

 “Iwon’t be.” Kristen replied.

It was still dark out and I was exhausted. My bed sounded perfect.

Part of me hoped Vivian would stay home but the responsible part of me told me I needed to be responsible for my own daughter. That meant letting Kristen sleep and I was going to stay up, regardless of how tired I was.

Getting into my car, I had to turn the defrost on for a few minutes before I could even see a little out of it. This is why I parked in a garage. The cold never bothered me until I had to scrape my windshield. Grabbing the ice scraper, I went ahead and cleared it off so I wasn’t making Kristen wait an hour before we could leave.

“We are headed to the door.” Kristen said in the mind-link.

“Alright.” By the time I got into the car, the heater had really started blaring. Anywhere I missed was starting to melt and the only thing left was to clean the frozen blood off the seat.

Pulling around, I saw Kristen in a wheel chair and the nurse flirting with a male doctor behind her. The look on her face was hard to miss but as soon as she saw me, she stopped and looked professional.

Neither woman moved until I was out of the car and had opened the back seat. “Back seat?” Kristen asked.

“The front is covered in blood.” “This is better anyway, that way you

don’t put pressure on your thigh.” The nurse gave Kristen a stern look.

“Yeah, yeah.” Iwas able to help Kristen stand up and inch her way into the back seat. She was practically laying down as I buckled her up. “Thank you.” I told the nurse before I shut the door. noveldrama

The nurse had started walking away at this point. “Of course. Have a great day, hopefully I don’t see you again!” She waved as I got into the car.

“Are we going home?” Kristen asked as I put the car into drive.

“We are. Is that okay?” Adjusting the rear view mirror, I was able to see her face. She was a little pale but doing okay.

“Yeah. I am going to close my eyes a

little.” “Alittle? How do you close your eyes a little?” The smile couldn’t stay away as she basically just passed out in the back.

Grabbing my phone, I dialed Colt’s number. “Hey.” “We are leaving the hospital.

Everything looks good.” “Perfect. I called everyone and told them what happened and our plans.

Text me when a good time to come over and talk. I rather not do it over the phone and I bet you guys are tired. I would like to see Ice again so whenever is fine.” “Sounds good. I'll let you know.” As much as Colt denies it. Him and Kristen are very similar in their mannerisms

and ability to multi-task. They always £0 one step above and beyond.

Thankfully, the snow had stopped coming down and the roads had been partially cleaned off. That made it easier to get home in one piece and quickly. As I got closer to our home, warriors had lined the way. Everyone nodded at me as I passed.

After parking in the garage, I had to carry a sleeping Kristen inside and laid her on the bed. Once she was situated, I went straight down to the panic room.

After unlocking it, the door opened up to Vivian and Adalynn playing with some toys. “Look! It’s daddy!” Vivian smiled warmly at Adalynn.

Adalynn got a big smile on her face and reached out to me. “Hey baby girl! How

was your night?” “Very uneventful. She behaved .

beautifully and we have just been playing. However, she is getting hungry.” Adalynn had her head on my shoulder as we made our way upstairs. “Thank you so much for staying with her.” “It was my pleasure. How is Luna?” “She is good. Resting in bed right now.” Sitting Adalynn in her highchair, I let out a big yawn. “You look exhausted.

Did you get any sleep last night?” Vivian asked as she pulled out a banana.

“Not really but I'm okay if you need to head out.” 68/9

“Of course not! You go take a name and we will just be hanging out whenever you are functional to take her, €» “I'm not going to argue. Kristen needs to be off her leg for 24 hours and then we are going to take Adalynn to another Alpha’s pack so I can do some work. You will get to have some vacation time to relax.” “Then I guess I need to soak up today! Now, off to bed you go...alpha.” “Thank you.” I didn’t have it in me to argue. I went to give Adalynn a kiss and she was too busy eating bananas that she didn’t even realize I was leaving. If the betrayal I feel right now is what Kristen feels every time Adalynn choses me, I feel like the biggest dick to walk the earth.

It took me just a few seconds to shut

the bedroom door, taking my clothes off and put shorts on, before I climbed into bed. “Alec?” Kristen looked up at me. Her eyes were barely open and her hair was covering half her face.

“Yes, love?” Wrapping my arm around her, I pulled her against me. “Where’s Adalynn?” “With Vivian. She sent me to bed.” “Good.” Kristen curled into me and her whole body relaxed. It wasn’t until I ran my hand down her ass that I realized she was only wearing her underwear and my t-shirt. When she got up to change was beyond me but I was all for it.

“Sleep good, love.” I whispered into her ear and closed my eyes. I didn’t

dream but I was so damn relaxed that I doubted either one of us moved the entire time we were sleeping. Very — much needed.













###Chapter 0580

 I woke up before Kristen did. Sliding out of bed, I managed to use the bathroom before Kristen started to stir.

“You were going to leave me here?” “I was hoping I didn’t wake you.” Walking into the bedroom, Kristen was trying to scoot herself up. “You leaving the bed wakes me up. Can you get me some sweats and we can spend the afternoon by the fire?” “Sure.” Going to the closet, her loosest sweats she owned was about to fall apart but she loved the rag.

It was fairly easy to get her into her sweats. I still didn’t have a shirt on but that didn’t bother me. As careful as

possible, I picked up Kristen and carried her to the couch. She was biting my arm to keep from yelling out.in pain.

“Look! It’s mommy!” Vivian was walking down the stairs. “We just woke up from our nap too!” “Hey, baby girl!” Kristen cooed. Vivian laid Adalynn down on Kristen. Taking a blanket, I covered them both up and turned on some cartoon on the T.V.

Adalynn turned around and snuggled next to Kristen and I went to go make a bottle.

“How did she sleep?” I asked Vivian.

“Really good. She is a very easy baby.” “I appreciate you letting me take a

nap.” I told her, “Of course! I'll get our of your hair but let me know if you need me. I can always come back in a moments notice.” Vivian waved as she headed towards the door.

“Will do, thank you again!” I yelled.

“Thank you!” Kristen yelled from the couch.

“Feel better!” Shaking the bottle, I was able to hand it to Adalynn before grabbing my cell phone. Sitting down on the other end of the couch, I pulled up my text message and sent one to Colt.

Me: We are awake and you can come over anytime. noveldrama

After a few minutes, I got a reply Colt: Okay.

“Can you start a fire?” Kristen asked.

“Oh shit, yeah.” That slipped my mind.

Getting up, I started putting the fire wood in the fire place. “Colt will be here shortly to update us on what has been discussed.” “Okay » “Do you need anything to eat or drink? Need any pain medicine?” I asked her as the fire came to life.

“Not right now. Thank you.” Kristen didn’t even look at me but kept running her fingers through Adalynn’s hair. As Adalynn watched her cartoon, Kristen watched Adalynn and I watched them both. Sitting just a few

feet from me was my entire life and damned if I didn’t want another baby more now then I did before. ~—— “Hello?” Colt yelled as he opened the door. I had almost forgot he was coming over.

“In here!” Kristen yelled.

There was two loud thuds before Colt walked into the livingroom. “How are you feeling sis?” Colt asked Kristen but leaned down and tickled Adalynn. She reached for him and he graciously accepted her hug.

“Was great until you stole my daughter.” «pechnically, she is my daughter too.” Colt walked over to another chair and sat down. He put her on his lap and was making faces as her. Adalynn’s little

giggle was music to my ears. & “Gross.” - I was with Kristen on that one. “Did you get with Gunther before he left?” I asked, jumping right into it.

“1 did. He swears he didn’t know anything about it.I puta command on him and everything. He did say that he has been using your cabin as a safe house. He found it when you were first building it. He was under cover and would always cover his tracks so you wouldn't know.” “pamn. Why didn’t he just ask?” Kristen look shocked.

“Get real, sis. He wasn’t going to ask that.” Colt looked at Kristen like she just asked the stupidest question possible. Which, it was a really stupid

question.

“Anything on the blood?” I asked.

“yup. It made a hit immediately. Came back to a warrior was part of Alpha Rip’s pack that is listed a someone who died in battle.” “He was listened as deceased?” I clarified.

“yup.” Colt nodded. “He supposedly died awhile ago.” “yet. he didn’t actually die until last night.” Kristen stated.

«rhe other DNA was the same. Listed as deceased. Only two DNAs found so you managed to rip someone’s heart out quite literally and probably nicked the arty of the second. The bullet hasn't come back yet but I would assume it is registered to the dead

man.” © “Why is everything always a puzzle?” Kristen rolled her eyes and turned off the T.V. Adalynn immediately started crying so she turned it back on but turned the volume down.

“Did Gunther leave to go back under?” I asked, half ignoring Kristen's question.

“He did. Left earlier this morning. I have a two SUVs lined up for us to take tomorrow. They are getting the oil changed and car seats putin. With you having to keep weight off your thigh, it would be too much for us all to take on.

This way, vou can lay in the back and relax as Alec drives. You can take care of Adalynn’s needs.” «phat would be a lot of babies in one vehicle.” Kristen nodded.

“you only have one baby to listen to cry. I have three.” “No, I have two babies to listen to whine.” I said as I stood up. My back was turned but I expected the pillow that hit my back.











###Chapter 0581 

“All ready to go?” 5 Kristen was sitting on the floor, keeping Adalynn entertained while I . packed what I needed to go under cover. “Hope so.” I had multiple recording devices, trackers, smoke bombs, ammo, tactical gear, night vision options and much more. It all fit into my small to-go bag that was easily worn as a backpack. It has been convenient the last few times I’ve been in this situation and should be just as useful.

“Still not happy I'm not going.” Kristen glared at my gear like it was the enemy,

“T know but you are hurt and we can’t afford to wait. I want to make sure things are moving forward and do some of my own payback.” “T know. Just sucks. I wanted to be the one to pay her back.” Adalynn laughed as she rolled to the side. Kristen leaned over and started tickling her until Adalynn kicked her thigh, making Kristen yelp out in pain.

Leaning down, I picked up Adalynn to keep her from hurting Kristen more.

“Careful, little one. Momma is broken right now.” Adalynn laid her head on my shoulder.

“I’m okay...” Kristen had rolled to her back and was breathing heavily. Laying Adalynn down in her chest, Adalynn looked at Kristen and smiled, Giving

mommy big open mouth kisses to make it better. “Gross...” Kristen was smiling as she gave our daughter a kiss but dodged the slobber.

“She just loves you.” There was no hiding the humor in my voice as I * stepped over them both to get the suitcases.

“Pll take it without the drool.” Kristen laughed.

Since I had everything laid out in the bed, I was able to pack Kristen’s stuff and Adalynn’s in one bag and mine in another. The doorbell ran right as I finished zipping it up.

“I got it.” Rolling my eyes, Kristen tried to get up like she could answer it.

“I could have done it!” She yelled after

me.

“Sure, you could have.” Opening the door, Colt was standing off to the side on the phone. He nodded at me before tossing me the keys and walked off to keep talking. Two SUVs were in front of my house. I could see Penny had gotten out and was leaning in the back doing something.

Walking back inside, I found Kristen managed to get herself standing up.

She had a crutch to help her walk.

“Ready?” I asked before grabbing Adalynn.

“Yeah, let’s get in the car and then you can put the bags in.” Kristen started limping to the SUV.

“I could carry you,”

“Save that sexy talk for the bedroom.” It was all I could do but roll my eyes at her. As soon as we were outside, I stepped around her and . made my way to get Adalynn buckled up. Kristen slapped away my hand as I tried to help her up so I just went inside and grabbed the bags.

Adalynn had her own tiny house traveling with us and Kristen wasn’t much better but I was able to get it all packed by the time Kristen got situated and was ready to go.

“I had some scouts run the drive and it appears to be clear. We got a couple hours drive so if you need to pee, you need to do it now.” Colt looked directly at Kristen. noveldrama

“I got an empty bottle!” Kristen stuck her tongue out at Colt.

“Gross. Glad she is your problem.” Colt smirked before winking at her and walking back to his SUV.

Shutting the doors, I got behind the wheel and started the engine. “Last chance, forget anything?” “I think I’m good.” Adjusting the mirror, I saw Kristen smiling at our daughter. She was tickling her, making her little laugh warm my heart.

“Alright, here we go.” Colt put a walkie talkie on the dash so we could communicate as we drove.

The whole drive was a few hours drive.

He was located more into the mountain range, making the scenery much more appealing, It spoke to my wolf more as

we went through the winding roads.

Every now and then, I would recognize warriors that were positioned discreetly along the drive. The sun was high in the sky, making everything illuminate our way.

Most of the drive was easy as Adalynn and Kristen took naps.

After a few snacks, Adalynn was done being in her car seat. Thankfully, we were just a few minutes away from Jace’s pack.

There was a welcoming party was as pulled into the territory. The large 12 foot iron fence towered over us as we were welcomed. Women and children were smiling and waving but it was Jace and Echo standing at the steps to the massive castle that put a smile on

my face.

The memories of coming here growing up was something I'll always cherish.

“We are here.” I told Kristen. She was busy trying to calm a fussy baby.

“Good. She wants out, badly.” Pulling into a parking spot, I was able to turn the car off and get around to get Adalynn out. As soon as she was in my arms, she calmed down. Her eyes scanned the area but she didn’t get shy, instead, she was waving a people.

Kristen took a little more time inching her way out of the SUV. I had to hold my arm out for her but thankfully, Jace came over to help.

“Need any help?” “Yes, please.” I was a little surprised

Kristen took Jace’s help as he helped her out and handed her, her crutch.

“Thanks. That ride was a little long.” “I bet. Echo has a late lunch set up and I think you will find it relaxing.” Jace motioned for Kristen to go first before helping me with our bags.

“Thanks, man.” «1 should thank you. This is going to be fun.” Jace slapped on me in the back as we walked in.

“Is that Miss Adalynn? Come here sweet girl!” Echo came forward and to my surprise, Adalynn lunged into her arms.

“That’s a first.” Kristen laughed at my expense,








###Chapter 0582

 I was stuck standing on the porch steps as Echo carried my child inside and she didn’t even cry out for me. Kristen was limping in behind her, loving every second of this and my heart was broken. “Damn.” “Rejected by a six month old baby.” Jace stood beside me and laughed.

“Kiss my ass.” Grumbling, I walked passed a very amused Jace and into his pack house. It was decorated in old stone with wooden floors that look to be original but parts were still an old brick. It was like a blast in the past the way they refinished the woodworking but it was elegant. If anything happened to this building, it would be history that couldn’t be replaced.

“I’ll put your bags down in your room.” Jace headed up the stairs.

Following him up, the girls went into another room. “I'll come with you.” “Echo has a late lunch for everyone in the sunroom. We can head there after.” “It’s been ages since I’ve been here.” Even though Jace was closer to Colt, I still had great memories here. “I remember someone pushing me down the stairs.

“That feels like a life time ago.” Jace smirked as we reached the fourth floor.

“It really does. I think the last time I saw everyone before we all did our own things was like when we were ten.”

“Sounds about right. Lars will be here any minute.” Jace stood to the side so | could watch him unlock our room.

Pushing the door open, he had provided us with a suite. There was a livingroom with a separate kitchen and bathroom and two bedrooms. “I figured you guys would be more comfortable in this room. Colt and Penny are directly across the hallin a similar room. The staff should have brough up cribs for the kiddos but if you guys need anything else, let me know.” “I’m sure everything will be just fine.” By the amount that Kristen wanted me to bring, we should have everything under the sun already.

Jace’s stomach started rumbling. “I'm going to head down, Come down when your ready.”

Dropping what was in my hands, I was ready to eat as well. “I'm ready. I'll organize this later. It wouldn’t matter how I did it anyway, Kristen will change it.” Walking out, I shut the door and locked it.

“That’s the truth.” Jace nodded.

“I never did tell you I'm sorry I coudn’t make Echo’s luna ceremony.” It was before I even met Kristen and I was in training but I still felt bad. Dad had me do extra training that the others didn’t do because I needed to be the best.

“It’s all good. Your dad still came.” We were reaching the ground floor and the sounds of squeezing babies were hitting our ears. “Echo is wanting to accomplish a few things before I have | that to listen to.” &»

“Blessing and a curse.” 1 laughed There wasn’t anything like listening to your child laughing but the cries were rough at times.

“Someday.” “There you guys are! We are waiting and I am starving!” Echo smiled warmly at me but glared at Jace.

“Well, when you travel with your entire house, it needs to be put down.” I defended Jace. Sitting beside Kristen, Adalynn was bouncing in her lap. To my pleasure, Adalynn reached for me and sat perfectly still on me.

“On the menu is Elk steaks with potatoes and steamed veggies. Hope you enjoy!” Echo clapped her hands and the doors instantly opened. The staff brought plates of sizzling steaks out to us.

“Starting without us?” Lars’s voice echoed behind us.

“I didn’t think you were going to make it in time!” Jace stood up and shook his hand. I was going to follow but Lars waved us off.

“I think we made it just in time!” Emily smiled as she moved around. She was seated next to Penny and Lars sat next to Colt. Their babies were on a blanket next to the wall but out of the walkway. noveldrama

“We have a high chair for Miss ~ Adalynn if she would like?” Echo asked me.

“sure. That would be great.” Right on cue, a staff member brought out a wooden highchair. After putting Adalynn in it, they buckled her in and

brought out a plate of cut bananas, carrots and pieces of finely chopped steak. Adalynn didn’t waste a second before picking up a steak, examining it and than ate it. After a few chews, she grabbed a handful and shoved the rest into her mouth.

The table busted up laughing. “That’s my girl.” I laughed along with them.

“This all looks amazing!” Penny smiled at Echo.

“I’m glad you like it. have arranged for the kids to take naps after lunch and someone will watch them or you are welcome to bring them but I have to show you guys around! I've been really working on preserving this castle and I want to show it off to someone who will enjoy the beauty.”

Echo beamed at Penny and Kristen “1 appreciate the natural beauty.” Jace rolled his eyes.

“Okay.” Echo use a mockery tone but took a bite.

“There is whiskey and a fireplace for us to hang out after so we can discuss what we are doing moving forward.” Jace ignored Echo.

“That sounds like a room I want to visit.” Lars took a large bite and nodded at Jace.

“There is a large Elk head hanging on the wall.” Echo shook her head at Lars.

“It is a prize.” Jace smiled back at her.

I just tuned everyone out as | finished

eating. Listening to their bickering was fun for awhile but it got old. If I could live in the mountains, I would. It’s just a deep innate feeling to want to live in a forest.

“What are you thinking about?” Kristen interrupted my thoughts.

Responding back in the mind-link, “how much I love being in the forest.” I said.









###Chapter 0583

 One by one, we filed into the lounge room. Jace had multiple massive dark brown leather couches that circled around a massive coffee table. The only opening had an equally large fireplace.

The stone that bordered the fire appeared to be original as well. A small fire was crackling but it was the wall to ceiling windows that caught my attention. The over look of the mountain side was breath taking. The tree tops were sparkling with a fresh layer of snow, untouched by human hands.

“Okay, from what I gathered, Ann and Anthony have been working with rogues. However, the blood that was found at Alec and Kristen's cabin was from a dead man.” Colt slapped down a

couple folders. It was physically painful to walk away from the window and back to the group discussion.

“How did she manage to make it out alive?” Lars asked.

“She was in the hot tub when she realized she wasn’t alone. She made her way to the bedroom and used the door to keep them from flanking her.

Eventually, she was forced to jump out the window.” Sitting down, I pushed away the pictures of our tainted cabin. “She’s lucky to be alive. Look at his rap sheet.” Colt pulled out one of the two dead man’s files.

Jace walked over with four whiskeys on the rocks. “It said that Anthony had registered him as dead. We can assume that everyone he listed is not dead but

his own personal army.” Taking one, I just leaned back and listened. If it was up to me, I would just storm the place or drop an Atom bomb on it. However, that would kill too many innocent lives. However, itis fun to think about.

“These are all specialized warriors.

Taking them out will be challenging.” Lars looked at the paper.

«Jce hasn't trained in over 6 months and took two out. I don’t want to underestimate them but they are also just men. We are just as trained.” Colt frowned.

“Kirsten isn’t a normal person either.

Your dad make sure of that. However, that is besides the point. What is our next move?” Lars asked.

Jace got a rather large smile on his face. “There is this bar that is between the packs. I have someone I use, and have scheduled a meeting with for tonight. Though, this is what Tam purposing.” © Jace handed us each a folder. We all took a moment to look it over. On the first page, it was a rough estimate of their pack’s layout but what was highlighted was their water system.

The next paper was their air conditioning system and access points from their pack house. Since we were once allies, we do have a unique acknowledgment of his floor plan.

«What is this man going to do for us tonight?” Lars asked. He didn’t look up at his folder as he asked the group.

«He has some supplies we are going to

need.” Jace looked around, making sure everyone was paying attention.

Once he had all eyes on him, he continued. “It’s not like we can poison everyone as they are all innocent but we can put leaks in the pipes, place mold and other things around their air conditioning so let’s say the state comes to inspect and they have to quarantine everything...” “That’s good.” Lars said.

Jace made eye contact with me. “Alec?” Everyone looked over at me. “That’s good and all but T'want blood. They tried to kill Kristen and making them live in a hotel isn’t going to cut it.” «1 understand that but we need to play the long game here. There are some pack members that work in public

places from his pack. Rumor has it that Ann and their new direction is very unpopular. We need a few eyes on the inside so we will need to visit them and see who we can get on our side.” “So, what is the end game? Are we looking at eliminating his pack? Are we going to use give them a headache? What is our ultimate goal here?” Colt asked the group.

No one spoke for a moment. “That is really up to Alec. It was his family that got attacked. What do you want? It’s Kristen who she wronged. Yeah, Colt, you are in there but itis Kristen she targeted.” [ was quiet for a long moment. All the times I saw Kristen bleed, all the time she has been bruised, hurt and emotionally struggling because of Ann

just flashed before my eyes. “This doesn’t end until Ann is dead. Kristen isn’t going to be a peace knowing Ann is out there. Until Ann is dead, I'm not done. Whatever that means for the pack and for Anthony... itis what itis.” “J agree. Ann needs to die and if that means to eliminate the pack... I guess Jace is going to get more land.” «1t would be your land.” Jace looked shocked.

“I might keep a chunk for myself but we have more land than we know what to do with.” I didn’t want the land. I wanted Ann dead.

“We can finalize details after but are we in agreement?” Colt asked Lars and Jace.

They looked at each other before looking at us. “Count us in. I'll go call Carson and Hank and fill them in.” Jace stood up and walked out of the room.

Colt and Lars started talking about different option on ways to get into the pack. Standing up, I went back to the window. This was a different kind of peace that I wanted some of. I'd defiantly be keeping a piece just for myself for vacation but I didn’t want to own all of this. My responsibility is to my pack. To Kristen. All my energy will be put into ending Ann’s life. If that means war against Anthony, then so be it. Kristen will never know fear again. noveldrama

The door opened as Jace walked back in. “They are in. We should get ready to leave in a few hours. The fun is about to

start.”









###Chapter 0584 

Kristen’s glare was Pounding into my back as | finished getting ready. I knew we were meeting Jace’s man but we would Probably be doing some activity tonight as we]]. My nicer pair of combat pants were a little tight on my ass but otherwise fit well. Kristen even Packed new boots for me So they were €xtra soft but more firm arounq the ankle than [ like.

I was finishing tucking my shirt in when Kristen finally decided to talk.

“I'm walking better now.” “Kristen, you can’t go. We talked aboyt this,” Turning around, I could fee] the frustration through our bond.

“I'm sorry, love, Can you please just stay here, watch over Adalynn and pe

ws +15 BONUS safe? Let me handle this and I will tell you all about it when we get back.” Kristen opened her mouth to argue when a knock sounded on the door. Her mouth snapped shut but it was her eyes that spoke volumes. As buckled my belt, I was able to walk over and open the door.

“Ready?” Colt was standing there in a similar outfit with a bag over his shoulder.

“Sure am.” “Fucking bullshit.” Kristen muttered. noveldrama

Adalynn was sleeping in her own room and Kristen was stuck watching T.V by herself.

“Penny is setting up the video monitor and will come hang out. I think Echo and Emily will be here shortly as well.”

“Wonderful.” Kristen was in a pissy mood and nothing was going to change that. It might actually be better if she was by herself but who was | to suggest such a thing.

Grabbing my own bag, I leaned down and gave Kristen a kiss on the forehead since she refused to look up at me.

“Love you.” “If you loved me, you would take me along.” Ijust rolled my eyes as | walked past Colt. Colt just smirked at his sister.

“I'll bring you back a cupcake to sweeten that sour mood.” “Fuck. You.” If there was something within throwing distance, she would have pelted Colt before he could make

it out of the room.

I blew her a kiss before I shut the door completely. “Way to piss her off more.” I said as we walked down the hall.

“Always a pleasure.” Colt laughed at his own little joke in his head. There are times I think I got used to their twin shit but they have the same laugh and it gets weird again.

We were quiet the rest of the way down the stairs. “Did you guys get your beauty rest?” Lars asked as we walked into the foyer.

“There is always time to annoy my twin.” Colt shifted the bag to his other hand.

“Let’s go before it gets too late.” Jace mirrored my eye roll and walked out

the front door.

“So moody.” Lars whispered to Colt.

“Why? Someone else isn’t the happiest either.” Jace and I shared a look as we took the front seats and the happy couple got in the back. “Kristen was pissy she couldn’t go.” “We aren’t mad, just focused. Not everything is fun and games.” Jace yelled as he pushed the gas.

“We are going to put mold in a guys air conditioner so he has to quarantine. It is quite literally a game.” Lars was completely unfazed by our focused attitude.

“It is winter. Although the air conditioner would be fun, he won't use

SW *19B0NUS it for awhile. We need something for the heater.” Colt and Lars went into their own conversation.

Jace and I just let it £0 and focused on the task at hand. I kept pulling out the binoculars I brought to check them and everything else. By the time we pulled into the city, the night sky was completely lit up with stars. The full moon was so bright that we probably wouldn’t even need our wolf eyes to see in the dark.

Soon enough, we were in a dangerous part of the town. We were the most dangerous people on this street but men lined the corners with hoods over their faces. By the smell of it, they had a wide range of drugs, ranging from basic marijuana to heroin.

Jace pulled up to this one more popular

house. Music was blasting and men were scattered along the yard. They didn’t even try to hide their giocks.

“Leave any guns here. We won’t need them.” Jace said.

Thankfully, Colt and Lars put on their game faces as we stepped out. I was never more thankful that Kristen wasn’t with me than I was right now.

Having to worry about her safety would keep me from doing what I needed to do.

Jace was one step ahead of me and the other guys were directly behind us.

“Ivan.” Jace nodded as we walked to the porch.

“Who are they?” It was then I realized he was a wolf but not near as strong as we were.

“With me.” Jace ignored his question

and kept walking up the stairs.

As soon as the door was open, my ear drums about burst from the music. To the left, I caught a glimpse of a girl doing a line of coke off the coffee table and some people making out by the fire place. The smell of alcohol, drugs, blood and sweat was making me want to gag but I kept it in.

The next room had a table with six men around a table with some chips and money. I didn’t get to see what game they were playing but the sheer amount of money was evident enough that it was serious.

At the back of the house, we walked down some stairs. The music quickly died down as we went under ground and down a narrow hallway. We were almost single file until the every end.

“He has been waiting.” Someone growled at Jace.

“So open the door, asshole.” There was a small growl but I saw some light as he listened. As soon as my eyes landed on the man behind the desk, I'knew we were in the right place.










###Chapter 0585

 “What kind of trash are you bring | around here, Jace?” The man was sitting back on his office chair with his fingers touched each other in front of him.

His hair was shaggy with dark circles under his eyes. The same green as my own. “The trash took itself out years ago but you would know something about that, wouldn’t you?” I said before Jace could say anything.

I could feel the confusion coming off Jace. “Um, Alec...” “Don’t worry. This piece of shit isn’t going to put a hit out on us.” Walking forward, he stood up and met me half way. Skipping the hand shake, he pulled me into a hug. There was so

many emotions running through me, Mostly surprise but shock and amusement was in there.

“Good to see you, boy.” “How did you meet Jace?” I asked as he let me go. He went back to his seat and I took one of the two that were in front of his desk.

“Can we have some clarification?” Jace asked a little more annoyed.

“Did work for his dad.” “Jace. This is my godfather and uncle, Maddox. He was dad’s best friend growing up. However, Maddox couldn’t keep out of trouble.” “I'm sorry about his passing. I didn’t hear about it unti] after the fact. you have been busy.” Maddox narrowed his

AV de Abd 4 eyes at me.

“Ididn’t know your dad had a brother...” Jace said as he took a seat.

“I'was almost ten years younger and like he said, the black sheep of the family. My parents cut me out of the family before I was even 18. However, | think I did well for myself. You should have seen their face when I was named godfather.” Maddox shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal. “Either way, I have built a life for myself here and a very lucrative one at that.» “It appears so.” | agreed.

“So, what is it that you need? Why am | seeing you under these circumstances?” Maddox looked between Jace and myself.

Wy TY BON “Fuck, he’s your family. You tell him.” Jace was clearly annoyed at this point.

“My mate is Kristen Jeffreys. Brian Jeffreys of Blue Fang Pack’s daughter.

This is her twin brother, Colt.” | nodded back at Colt. Maddox looked behind me and acknowledged someone So I assume Colt nodded. noveldrama

“Growing up, she was abused by her step mother, Ann, Long story short, Ann was in his cells. Alpha Anthony staged a rogue attack and got Ann out.

He marked and mate her, making jt impossible for us to get to her.

However, there has been multiple attempts on her life and now we want revenge.” “I'read the report that Jace sent over.

That is basically the same thing he sent

&J 1580NUS but I see you are wanting to make their lives hell before you kill them.” Maddox pulled out a few pieces of Paper and started looking over them. | “Can you help us?” | just asked point blank. No reason to beat around the bush.

“Well...” Maddox sighed and set the Paper down. “I was going to say no because it was Petty and I don’t make it a habit to get involved in Alpha’s feuding but since you are family, Iwill help you out.” “You weren't going to help us? Then why the fuck did you ask me to come all the way down here?” Jace had changed from dnnoyance to anger.

“I'haven’t met you in person yet. Just because you were recommended

doesn’t mean I will accept your business. I wanted to gage your personality.” “Fucking bullshit.” Jace stood up so fast that his chair pushed back a few inches.

“I didn’t get where | am by working with everyone, Now, either sit down and settle down or leave.” Maddox calmly looked at Jace.

“He’s good.” Jace looked at me but nodded and sat down, “Great. Let's get down to business and since this has now turned personal, | am willing to add in my own stuff, We can attack tonight, | assume since he was once your allie that you know the layout of the pack?” Maddox looked at Jace, |

T.-C TEs “We do.” Colt answered for him. He stepped forward and handed him a vanilla envelop.

Maddox took it and shifted through it all. “Great. I will get with my team leader and they will get ready for an attack.” “I’m all for that but I do not want innocent lives to be Jost. Itisn’t the pack’s fault what happened. Actually, we believe Anthony either staged his first mate’s death or he did it himself to get rid of her to make way for Ann.

They had a lot of changes and most are not happy with it, We have intel that there is some Pack members we can probably persuade to be on our side,” “That’s good.” Maddox nodded, Reaching over to his phone, he hit the

intercom button. “Victor, bring in the blue folder.” After Maddox released the intercom, my curiosity got the best of me. “What is the blue folder?” Maddox looked at me and smiled. “It is how we get things done. We will follow most of what you have Proposed to me.

There will be an attack and we will have multiple insects that will give them a headache but the folder has the big tricks.” Just as he finished talking, there was a knock on the door. After a moment, jt opened and a rather short guy walked in. He was muscular, sure, but he was short. Kristen was probably taller than he was.

Maddox took the folder from who | assumed was Victor and handed it

IE directly to me. When I opened it up, there was pages on different herbs, J plants and flowers. Each page told us what they did and how they affected the body.

“I'don’t understand.” Jace said as he kept looking over my shoulder.

“Each plants does something different to the body. When mixed together, they do additional things. So, you mix Poison ivy with mushrooms to create a paste. When that paste is applied, they will break out into a rash and have intense hallucinations. It takes a day or two for it to develop into their system so if you put it on the door handles...» “Thats...” Jace started.

“That’s not even the best one. Come on, let’s get moving so we don’t waste

ATM df the night.” Maddox stood up and was way more excited for this. Something told me I was either going to have a great night or we made a terrible mistake. There was a reason he was cut off from the family.












###Chapter 0586 

Maddox made us use his vehicles and since none of us could mind-link each other, we were left sitting in silence across from each other. Maddox was in front with the diagram of the pack and muttering to himself. He was planning out who was going where and | could only make out certain words like havoc and destruction, For a few hours, we just sat there, looking at each other and waited to see what our fate would look like. There Was no turning back. Jace had opened pandora’s box and there was no closing it. Colt had his hands covering his face so I couldn't read his expression. Jace had his head leaned back and looking at the ceiling, Lars glancing between Maddox and and

looking out of the window.

All too soon, the vehicles slowed down until they pulled off the main road and onto a dirt path in the forest. The moon was unusually bright, making our energy level soring high. After a few hundred feet, the vehicles stopped.

“Alright. Let’s get out and I'l] tell everyone their position.” Maddox had anew look in his eyes as he spoke before he got out.

“Here we go...” Lars whispered as the back door opened for us to get out. One by one, everyone filed out and waited quietly for their mission.

I'watched as men were pulling out bags that were moving, metal cages that were hissing and even a wooden box of different glass jars, Multiple pairs of gloves were placed on top of the jars.

“Alright. You four are going to be going { with each group. They all have their own mission and your only goal is to make sure my men stay alive.” Maddox came up to us but didn’t look at us.

“We aren’t spilling innocent blood.” Lars looked hard at Maddox.


“That isn’t what this is about and it’s either their blood or mine. You came to me for help so here we are. Do we have aproblem?” Maddox walked up to Lars and challenged him.

The alpha in Lars did not like it one bit.

“Alright. We are wanting to be smart about this and so far you haven't told us what you have planned. Trust is a two way street, Maddox.” I jumped in before Lars would do something we al] would regret,

Maddox looked straight in Lars’s eyes that never blinked before he finally broke eye contact. “Colt, you will be with team B. They will be in charge of getting to the pack house and administering the herbs. Lars, you will be with team D. They will be making a trip to the sewers and focusing on the pipes. Jace, you will be with the warriors that are depositing different invasive insets, Finally, Alec, you wil] be with me and we will be causing general chaos as they can achieve their goals. Any questions?” When no one answered him, he took that as the answer was no. Raising is hand in the air, he twirled it as the different groups broke off. “See you all on the other side.” Jace shook his head and followed his group out, I'followed Maddox as he took off into a

fast jog into the woods. Men were scattered around me but they were all expertly moving so quietly that I was seriously concerned. What kind of missions have they done before? Slowing down, Maddox got low as we approached the boarding wall. There was a six foot stone wall around the entire property with guards positioned every thirty feet. After a moment, Maddox nodded to one of his men.

I'watched as he pulled out a weird looking gun. Pointing it at the first guard, he fired it. Hitting the man in the chest, a white powder erupted in his face. Before he even gota grunt out, his body fell to the ground.

“Kevin?” I heard another guard yell.

Three more times the gun went off and men fell. No sounds were made other

than their bodies hitting the ground.

No alarms went off, I felt a nudge on my arm. Looking over, Maddox showed me a signal disrupter, making it impossible to use any electrical devices. Without waiting for me to even register fully what that meant, he got up as they made their way to the wall. One by one, everyone jumped over, landing softly.

Quickly and quietly they ran into Anthony’s territory. A housing portion came up. As we marched down the streets, I saw Lars and his men stop and open the sewer entrance before jumping straight into the hole. We kept going until we came up to a rather dark part of the pack grounds.

Multiple cages were sat in the middle of the circle, The first one that got

opened, a swarm of flies came out and went int every direction. There was hundreds of them, making the birds | get stirred up.

Cage after cage were opened with different insects being let loose.

Maddox then handed his men so many different things that I couldn't even make them all out. Just as he opened the last of the bag, there was a scream and a loud bang before the pack woke up. noveldrama

“Shit, that was early. Okay, men, you know what to do. Alec, you better have our backs!” Maddox yelled before everyone jumped up and ran off into different directions, I'wasn’t even sure where to go. The men literally went everything. Some where kicking over the trash can,

punching out windows and literally trashing everything.

It only took a few seconds before there warriors came out from the houses to start protecting their pack. Thankfully, Maddox’s men weren’t killing them but more or less knocking them out.

The swarm of flies were causing so much distress that even Maddox’s men Were swatting them away. It wasn’t until I heard an alpha’s growl that | looked over and saw Anthony standing on the steps of the pack house.

A few men started walking towards him but I ended that quickly. “He is mine.” My wolf said with glowing eyes,











###Chapter 0587

 More of his warriors joined the fight, | making the entire peaceful night shift into utter chaos. Maddox was yelling out commands but my eyes were focused on Anthony.

His attention was shifted to Colt. Colt had his beta by the neck. His feet were off the ground but Colt’s entire focus was on the beta and not Anthony.

“COLT!” I yelled as I took off running.

It was like slow motion as I sprinted towards Anthony. He had shifted into his wolf in mid air as he leaped down the stairs. Colt barely registered my voice, making him turn towards Anthony. His wolf just had landed on the ground when Colt shifted his

potion so the beta was no between Anthony and himself.

Anthony’s wolf was in motion so there was no stopping him from wrapping his mouth around his beta’s stomach before he fell on top of Colt. My own wolf came forward as blood went flying and we weren’t sure who's it was.

Jumping into the air, my wolf flew towards Anthony. Tucking his head, his shoulder made contact with Anthony’s ribs. The sickening snap of ribs were music to my hears as we tumbled over each other.

There wasn’t any time to see if Colt was okay. My wolf managed to slid on his paws, in the ready position for another attack. Anthony’s wolf struggled a little bit more.

“LET’S GO!” Maddox's voice barely

penetrated my focus, making my wolf angry. He wanted to finish this but that isn’t what we came for. By this time, Anthony’s wolf was back on his feet, teeth growling at me.

“RETREAT!” “RETREAT!” I heard across the valley.

Colt’s wolf walked up beside me. I wanted to finish this but we didn’t have enough men to go against his warriors. Together, we backed up until we turned and ran away from a growling Anthony. He knew he wasn’t a match between Colt and I but we were no match for his entire army of men.

Jumping the wall was easy in our wolves. Colt raised his nose in the air and went off to the side of a tree. By the

time I saw him again, he was carrying two pairs of shorts in his mouth. As soon as we were back by the vehicles, we shifted back and were pulling up the shorts by the time everyone else arrived.

“GET IN!” Maddox was pissed but so was I.

Everyone piled in but no one said a word. Lars had a gash across his face otherwise he was fine. Jace seemed unhurt and Colt was covered in blood but was grabbing his own ribs.

“His beta?” I asked looking at Colt.

“Dead. He bit his whole side of him off.” Colt looked directly at me. noveldrama

“Why the fuck did you engage? My instructions were clear!” Maddox turned and glared at us.

“Fuck you and your instructions!” I was pissed and my wolf was coming to the surface. “There wasn’t any. : instructions and did you actually believe that I wasn’t going to protect Colt? If there is an opportunity to kill Anthony or Ann, I am fucking taking ie “That’s the problem with being an Alpha. You want the quick kill and don’t appreciate the art of battle anymore. All you did by killing his beta was anger him more so it will up his own attacks. You just screwed yourself by allowing him to know it was you that was behind this.” “Shit, he knew we were going to be behind this from the start.” I leaned back as my anger was dissolving. I was still pissed but not ready to rip his head off.

“He killed his own beta. I wasn’t going to do it. He jumped and I used him for a human shield. He killed his own beta.” Colt was equally pissed off as I was.

“Did anything go according to your plan?” Maddox's eyes met Colt’s and narrowed. “We accomplished everything we set out to do, other than you fucking alphas trying to measure dicks.” “Fuck off, Maddox. Now I remember why dad cut ties. You are a fucking cowboy and do what is best for you.

You didn’t include us in the decision and didn’t even tell us what we were going to be involved in!” “I DID ALL THIS FOR YOU!” Maddox yelled back. “You came to me for help!”

“We wanted to terrorize him, not start awar. You did too much and now he has every right to declare a war.” Jace | said through gritted teeth. “We wanted to sneak and do things without making our presence known. We wanted to stay in the shadows and now that is fucking gone.” “You went in knowing they would start defending their territory. They won’t be on our side anymore. You put insects in people’s homes and | destroyed their water system. Not a single pack member is going to talk to us.” Lars added.

“Just be patient. Let’s see how this plays out.” Maddox seemed unbothered by our attitude. “Don’t forget you came to me for help. Maybe you should have done your own research before contacting me.”

Maddox looked directly at me. “When you come crawling back, and you will, I may not be there to help anymore, Didn’t your dad teach you not to burn bridges?” “Did you forget what it means to work as a team and not as your men aren’t disposable? Did you forget that every life is worth something?” I challenged back. “Tonight put a bigger target on my family. On all of our families. You fucked each and every single one of us over. Tonight upped their game. We are responsible for thousands of people’s lives. You may not care if your men die but we do. After tonight, you put a hit on your own back. Don’t think for one second that Anthony won't figure out who you are. You need to now sleep with one eye open. When Anthony retaliates, he destroys. You fucked

yourself over just as bad.” My wolf was calm and collected as I delivered each word, looking directly into his eyes. —








###Chapter 0588 

“Come to my office in two days.” Maddox glared at me as we pulled into his home base. The sun was starting to rise, and the weight of what happened still pressed down on our shoulders.

“Yeah.” It was all I could say as we piled out of his vehicle and got into our own. Jace didn’t waste any time as he pulled out to head home.

“You guys need to put your betas on high alert for any attacks.” Jace said after about an hour of driving with complete silence.

“Did you do any research on this guy before you decided to use him?” Lars was pissed.

Jace looked back at him before he answered. “We have used him for odds and end stuff for years. At least my dad did. This was my first time using him.” “Why did your dad cut ties with your uncle?” Lars didn’t respond to Jace.

“He never really said what happened, just that he was a lose cannon that didn’t have any regards to safety.” I tried to rack my brains to figure out what happened or if dad had ever said anything but I came up blank.

Thankfully, we were pulling into the pack grounds. “I’m taking Emily and we are leaving. Alec, I'll be in touch.” Lars said. He jumped out of the SUV before it fully came to a stop.

“Lars! Wait!” Jace jumped out and chased after Lars.

“Let me check on Penny and I'll come to your room.” Colt said more calmly than I anticipated. We had more skin in the game than the rest so I wasn’t worried about Colt jumping ship.

“Alec!” Kristen yelled my name as we walked through the front door.

“Upstairs.” Kristen was taken aback by my voice. She was still on crutches.

After taking a few steps, I felt instantly terrible and turned back to carry her.


“What's wrong? What happened?” She asked as I took the crutches from her. I was very much aware of the crowd that was now watching us. It was so early in the morning that I was a little surprised by how many people were

awake already. “Why is Colt covered in blood?” “I’ll tell you everything upstairs.” I repeated before scooping Kristen up.

She grabbed her crutches from me and made it easier for me to walk up the stairs.

Kristen put her hand on my chest and started examining me. “Are you hurt?” “I’m fine.” Physically anyway.

Emotionally, I was nervous and scared.

By the time we made it to the room, Colt and Penny were already standing at our door.

| “Where are the kids?” I asked as I set Kristen down and unlocked the door.

“Getting breakfast.” Penny said

quietly. I knew she was always nervous or scared around me. I could smell it.

She was intimidated by me but it was never my problem to worry about. That was part of being an alpha. Plus, Kristen found that part sexy.

“Tell me what happened!” Kristen demanded as she limped into the room.

“It was a fucking shit show.” Colt shook his head. Since he was still covered in blood, he stayed standing.

“Did you ever know that my dad had a brother?” I started, looking only at Kristen.

“Oh, um... I guess I don’t know muc about your family.” Kristen looked unsure and I felt a little pang of sadness.

“Dad had one brother that was disowned by the family. He was the black sheep and I’m not sure what all happened to get his disowned but he did. Jace had someone that his dad used for... off the book things and that is who is contacted. Turns out that person is my uncle.” Kristen was taking in all in but she was still confused. “What happened?” She repeated.

“He took things into his own hands.

We went to Anthony’s pack and were going to terrorize it. Just like we had talked about. Lars and some men messed up their sewer system. He released invasive flies or something.

Just caused utter chaos. Put something into the packhouse, stuff that I'm not even sure what it does.” I was still trying to process it.

“I mean, isn’t that what we wanted?” Kristen was so confused but her eyes went back to Colt. “Who’s blood is that?” “We told them not to kill inoccent people. For the most part, he listened and would just knock them out.” Colt looked directly at Kristen. “His beta came out and I over powered him. I had him by the throat but then Anthony came out. He spotted me and charged.

Alec yelled at the last minute and I used his beta as a human shield. His jaws clamped around his waist right as Alec plowed into him to get him off of me. In the end, Anthony ripped a whole in his beta’s side, killing him.” “Colt and I were ready to fight Anthony and put an end to it but more warriors came out. We were outnumbered and had to retreat. Anthony has enough

cause to declare a war.” I finished for him. noveldrama

“What happened to staying under the radar?” Kristen was getting angry.

“It snowballed and happened so fast.

When the alarm went off, instead of retreating like we wanted, Maddox kept going. It was like he wanted us to be seen or didn’t care the consequences of if we did get caught.” Colt shook his head. “You don’t kill a fucking beta and there not be repercussions. Anthony isn’t going to let this go. There is now a big target on our backs.” Kristen and Penny were silent for awhile as they absorbed it all. “When do we leave?” Kristen asked after a moment longer.

“We can’t just yet. Maddox wants to

meet in two days. We need to stay and make sure his pack is protected. After the meeting, then we will go home.

However, I do feel it would be safer for you to go home and stay home. We have the panic room. Fuck, your family can all go there.” I said as I looked at Colt.

“An attack here is imminent and they will be coming full force. We brought the fight here and now we have to help protect it.”










###Chapter 0589 

“I can’t leave you.” Kristen was processing everything but with her leg, I wasn’t sure her staying was a good choice.

“We can’t put Adalynn in a situation that is unsafe either.” I went over to her and knelt down on the floor.

Grabbing her hand, I tried to plead with her. “I can’t do what I need to do if you and Adalynn aren’t safe. Please.

Go home and stay in the safe room until I figure this out.” I could feel how torn she was. She wanted to stand beside me but she needed to protect our daughter.

Neither one of us were going to leave our daughter's safety in another person’s arms so our options were

limited.

Finally, Kristen landed on anger. Even trying to rein it in, she was still angry.

Not directly at me but at the whole situation. “Fine.” She pulled her hand from mine and pushed me away so she could stand up.

“Ice. Don’t be that way.” Colt started.

“It isn’t his fault.” Kristen froze with her feet on the ground and her hands on either side of the cushion. “I told you from the beginning that I am not someone that will be pushed aside when things get tough. Things are getting hairy so now [ am forced to hide away while my mate is left fighting.” Ignoring my hand, she pushed herself up and slowly walked to the bathroom before slamming the door.

Everyone was quiet as I stood back up.


We heard the toilet flush and the sink turn on but even after all that, she stayed in here. “Why don’t you guys go pack and we will meet you down stairs.” I said to Colt and Penny.

“Why doesn’t she want to stay with Adalynn?” Penny asked quietly.

My head snapped to Penny. Her question pissed me off. “Excuse me?” I knew my wolf was showing. Penny started shaking and even took a step behind Colt.

Thankfully, Colt answered for me. SIE isn’t about that. She was raised to be a warrior and she is being sidelined.

Kristen's instincts are to fight until death, not run away. That's why she get’s hurt so often. She refused to back down from a fight, something our dad

shoved into her mind. Now, she had to go against everything she is and hide.

Yes, protecting her daughter is.

extremely important, which is why she is going to go but she is leaving her mate to defend himself. Her mate that she has already proven to protect.” “Maybe it would be best if you guys left.” 1 said, trying to hold in my anger.

“Penny, can you get packing? I need to talk to Alec and then I'll get the car situated.” I could tell she didn’t like being dismissed but whatever Colt said in their mind-link caused her to turn around and walk out the door. As soon as it was closed, Kristen stepped out of the bathroom. “Why are you still here? I thought you have shit to do?”

She wasn’t using her crutches but slowly putting more pressure on her leg. “Ice, come on. Don’t be angry.” Colt walked over and sat on the bed.

Kristen had pulled out the suitcase and was working on tossing everything on the bed.

“puck off, Colt.” She didn’t even look at him.

«As soon as the meeting is over, we will be coming home. We will figure this out.” “Why did you even do it? If you knew your uncle was bad news, why did you even go?” Kristen rounded at me.

« know that for the rest of your life, you will be looking over your shoulder waiting to see if Ann will be standing there. Every alpha event, she will be there. The threat of her sending an

attack has already caused you to get attacked twice now. I'm not living like this. Declaring war was imminent. It was just a matter of who was going to do it and how soon. I'll be damned if I am going to let you live in fear for the rest of your life. She is the only lose end and we are going to eliminate her.” «At what cost, Alec? How many men are going to die just so don’t ever see Ann anymore? This isn’t what I wanted....” «What did you want, Ice? What did you expect to happen?” Colt grabbed her hand and forced her to look at him.

«I don’t know.” She shook her head.

“Declaring war with our packs is one thing but now Jace and Lar’s packs are in on this. They will be targets and now

he can attack anywhere of four different locations. Fuck, he might even attack Hank and Carson’s packs; just because they are allies of ours.” «We know. That is why we are going to play defense before we play offense.” Colt didn’t get too far. Kristen turned away from him and kept angrily throwing stuff into the suitcase.

“What happens if we get attacked at our pack while you are here? Have you thought of that?” Kristen asked without looking at us.

«please don’t make this harder than it has to be.” I tried to plead.

“I'm going to go get the car ready. You guys can fit into one SUV now and that will leave the other one for Alec and I to take home. We will be there in a few

days.” Colt stood up and after Kristen didn’t reply, he walked out the door.

«please don’t be mad.” Grabbing her waist, I twirled her around to look at me. As much as she tried to push me away, I held on tighter.

«I told you from the beginning that I won't be sidelined!” Tears threatened to fall down her face but she pushed them back. noveldrama

“It’s okay to cry.” I whispered to her.

«pm not sad! I'm that fucking pissed off that I want to cry. Do you know how long it has been since I’ve been this mad!”









###Chapter 0590 

“Not long enough.” I couldn’t help but chuckle at her. “Are you done fighting yet?” “Never.” “Idon’t trust anyone to keep Adalynn safe. If I can’t be around, I want you to be in charge of her safety.” “You are so full of shit. Let me go!” She struggled a little bit more before she tried bringing up her good knee.

“Whoa!” I barely dodged her attack on my balls but she got her wish and was free. There was a knock on the door, making this conversation come to an end. Trying to hide my own anger, I walked over to answer the door.

“What?” I answered as I looked at Lars.

He barged in, steam was still coming from his ears. “This whole fucking mess!” “I'’know.” Closing the door, I went over to the couch and sat down.

I' watched as Lars paced up and down the room, basically ignoring Kristen since he was in his own little world.

“Emily is scared shitless and I can’t blame her! She is already off to our pack.” “I thought you were going with her.” said more calmly than I felt.

“You know damn well I can’t leave as much as I want to.” Lars put his hands on his hips and glared at me.

“Why aren’t you pissed off?”

“Believe me, I am beyond pissed off and Jace will hear it.” I said but nodded towards Kristen. Lars followed my gaze and stiffened when he realized Kristen was in here.

“So gland you saw me. Nothing like being ignored and shoved to the side but all the men in my life.” Sierra flashed before her eyes, making Lars take a step back. It always amused me when men were scared of her wolf.

“You are leaving too?” He asked, a little more calmly.

“Apparently, because I guess saving your mate’s life before doesn’t get you anything. Apparently, growing up as a warrior means nothing once you are mated to a fucking alpha. Now, I am more useful hiding away in a panic room than standing beside the men |

have beaten one on one,” “Well, I see you have your hands full. I am going to wait in Jace’s office for you.” Lars gave Kristen a sideways glance before heading out. €» Kristen just rolled her eyes and shut her suitcase. She then started working on Adalynn’s stuff. “For someone that wants to get rid of me, you are doing absolutely nothing to help me pack.” “How long are you going to be mad at me?” I asked as I got up and helped pick a few things up. However, anything I touched, she ripped from my hands.

“Till we die but that might be sooner than later and I won’t be there to tell you TI'told you so as you take your last breath.” She looked up at me and

slapped me with some clothes of Adalynn with little buttons. Those fucking hurt. “I’m always mad at you: Why don’t you just leave me alone. Go do whatever you alphas need to do since I am no longer welcome to be part of it.” “Please?” I went to hold her again but there was another knock on the door.

This time, it opened and Colt stuck his head in.

“The car is ready. The babies are already in and just waiting on Ice and your stuff.” Kristen huffed and zipped it shut.

“Great. Why don’t you carry it all down stairs then. It will be quicker to get rid of me that way.” She glared at me as she limped past me.

Colt opened the door and walked in as

she tried to pass him. “Don’t you need these?” Colt grabbed her crutch and held it out to her. = Kristen stopped walking, looked directly at the crutch before looking back up at Colt. More calmly than I expected, she took the crutch and snapped it over her knee before tossing it to the side. After one last glare, she walked out of the room with a slightly less limp.

“Okay then.” Colt widened his eyes and | followed her out.

“Yup.” Was all I could say as we went slowly down the stairs. I wasn’t sure what she was going to do but I wasn’t about to miss the show. She was going rather slowly but eventually, we made it down. Jace was talking to his warriors. Everything was in utter chaos

with people running around.

“Alec, Colt. There you are.” Jace nodded to his warrior and walked over to us. “Ready to leave?” He looked at Kristen and looked at the luggage.

Kristen didn’t answer but pulled her fist back and socked him right in the nose. Blood instantly splattered as he took a few steps back, holding his nose.

“What the actual fuck?” He glared at Kristen. I could see the anger fill his eyes. Dropping the luggage, I stood directly behind her.

“You deserved that and you know it.” I growled back at him. “If it wasn’t her it was going to be me.” “You are going to want to walk away.” Colt walked up beside me and then it

was a stand off.

“This is MY pack!” Jace spit.

“Let’s talk privately in your office.” Lars came out from around the corner and looked at Jace.

“Fine.” He glared at Kristen as he walked passed her.

“Come on.” I said and put my hand on her lower back.

“Don’t touch me!” She pulled away from me and glared. People didn’t know if they should laugh or be concerned but I wasn’t too worried about it. I was just happy she was working through these emotions and not pushing it down.

I put the luggage in the back as Colt said goodbye to his family. Kristen got in the back, ignoring Penny’s smile atnoveldrama

her. “Bye bye my loves.” I said as | tickled Adalynn. She was sitting directly beside Kristen. She giggled before yawning loudly.

“I'love you.” I whispered to Kristen.

“Yeah. Get out.” She put her hand on my face and pushed me out of the SUV before slamming the door shut.

They drove off and I just stood there was watched as my family drove away.

Right as they were about to be outside of the mind-link range, I got the faintest ‘love you too’ from Kristen.

Only then did I go back inside.










###Chapter 0591

 As I'made my way up to Jace’s office, my phone started ringing. The urge to ignore it was pretty high but in the off chance it was Kristen calling, I decided to go ahead and answer it.

“Alpha Alec.” My hand was on the door knob when I heard who it was. “It’s me. Can we talk?” I'was so surprise that my body froze for a second. “How did you get my number?” “Colt gave it to me in case I needed it. I felt like I needed to tell you first.” Gunther's voice was quiet like he was whispering quietly.

Looking around, I didn’t see anyone so

I took a few more steps down the hall to put more distance between us. “Go ahead.” “ “T'have some old buddies in Anthony’s pack. You guys pissed him off big time.

His beta died and now he wants blood.

There was rumors going around that Ann wanted to have a baby with Anthony but he said he would get her one instead. He is gearing up for war.” “Is there anyone else on our side?” “You guys pissed a lot of them off but they are still on your side since you didn’t kill anyone.” There was some voices on the other side before the phone call cut off. I wasn’t sure what kind of trouble he was in but his warning was clear.

“Please, come in.” Jace said sarcastically. “I'just got the bleeding to stop.” “You deserved it.” I muttered as I sat on on a couch he had against the wall.

“I didn’t know that was going to happen!” Jace took the rag off his face and threw it as hard as he could against the wall. He was going to have some nice bruising but it would be gone by tomorrow. I was rather proud of my girl for that.

“They are pissed off and ready for war.

Is your pack alerted and ready to defend themselves?” I asked ignoring

his hissy fit.

“Yes. They are all on high alert and in battle positions.” “My pack is too.” Lars was back to pacing. “Emily should be home in a few hours.” “Kristen and Penny too.” Colt said as he looked at his watch. That was when I noticed his fingers tapping like Kristen's does when she is anxious.

“She was fucking pissed.” Lars looked at me.

“Don’t blame her.” I shrugged. “I would be too.” “There isn’t anything else we can do.

Maddox wants to meet us in two days.” Jace started but I stood up and interrupted him.

“I'am meeting him tomorrow and then I'am going home. We are done being on his time. This is my time, my family and I’m not waiting for him to decide he is ready to meet.” “I agree. I want to go home.” Colt followed my lead.

“An attack is imminent on my pack and you want to go home?” Jace looked at us like we were crazy.

“An attack came come to any one of our packs. The fact he only saw Colt and I makes me believe we are the targets. However, I got a call from MY inside guy and he had new information for us.” “Oh yeah? What is that?” Jace sneered.

“Fortunately, we didn’t kill anyone so

we still have some allies on our side.

However, the real information was that Ann wants a child to raise. Anthony said he was going to get her one. Can anyone guess who's child he is going to steal for his own personal gain?” Everyone was silent as they let that information sink in. “Gunther?” Colt finally asked.

“Yeah. My family is in the real danger.

The point is, now everything is fucked up, we have two choices. Come together and we strike first or wait at one of our four locations to see who gets hit. I rather it be on my terms than his.” “Shit.” Colt ran his fingers through his hair and took a few steps.

“Yeah. So you have me the rest of today but tomorrow, I am going home after

meeting Maddox.” “Fine. I'll stay and see how this plays out.” Lars walked out and slammed the door so hard that the pictures threated to fall off the wall.

“This did not go like I thought.” Jace sighed and sat down.

“We are going to go shower. We'll catch up with you later.” I said, ignoring his pity part. Colt followed me out but this time, Colt left the door open as we made our way to our room.

“Shut the door.” I said as Colt followed me into my room.

“What else did Gunther say?” Going to my clothes that Kristen threw on the ground, I pulled out a pair of sweats, t-shirt and underwear. “We

royally pissed them off but since the only one to die was the beta, we still have some allies. If we go to war, we will have to see who wants to switch lines and for now, we might get some information out of a few of them.” “Ann really said that about a child? She wants Kristen’s baby?” “Gunther said he heard a rumor. Not sure if it was true or how true it really was but my guess is yes. If Ann wanted a baby, who do you think she is going to take it from?” “We basically fucked ourselves over.” Colt punched the wall a few times.

“I know. Now I am suppose to be in two places at once. Do I leave my allies stranded to protect my family or stay here and leave Kristen to defend herself?” &»

“I'would say you are suppose to put family aside and do what is best for the pack. Kristen knows the obligations but that is also my sister.” “I know. Which is why after tomorrow, I am going home. Hopefully, my home is still standing when I get there.”noveldrama










###Chapter 0592

 Kristen POV By the time we made it home, I was exhausted. The car ride with four babies was absolutely ridiculous. As soon as one stopped crying, the next one would start. Both boys peed on me like three times each and the girls kept pulling my hair. Penny kept apologizing but it wasn’t her fault and I was just mad.

“Jasper? What are you doing here?” 1 asked as I stepped out of the SUV.

“Alec called and asked for me to meet you here and just hang out.” He shrugged and started helping with the bags.

“Bullshit. He wanted you to watch over

me.” I called him out. It felt nice to stretch my legs but damn if my wound wasn’t still sore.

“No you. More like Adalynn. Did he not tell you?” The conversation I had with Alec flashed before my eyes. He had just stepped out of the shower and was going to lay down for awhile to sleep but he promised he would be home tomorrow. It would be late but he would be home. That was right after he told me about what Gunther said and Ann wanting my child.

“Yeah. He told me.” By the time I made it inside, Jasper had all of my stuff put into my bedroom and Adalynn was in her high chair, ready for some supper. The smell of Tortellini pasta hit me full in the face.

“Hungry?” “I am but why are you cooking for me and where is Emmy?” “Alec did warn me that you would be in a good mood.” Jasper whispered.

Ignoring him, I got myself a plate.

“She is handling a few things but she will be here tomorrow to keep you company until Alec gets here.” “Aren’t we suppose to get another snow storm tonight?” “yeah but I don’t think it will be very much.” Jasper said as he sat down to feed Adalynn.

I got up on the stool and started eating.

“How long are you hanging out?” “For awhile.”

We sat in silence other than Adalynn’s laughter until she was finally done eating. While Jasper cleaned up, took Adalynn to get a bath and get ready for bed. Jasper walked in as I was rocking her while reading a book.

“I am going to head out for the night.

Let me know if you need anything.

There are warriors around the house.” “Okay, drive safe.” I whispered.

Jasper nodded and smiled at me before walking out. After I heard the door shut I immediately felt alone. Adalynn’s eyes started to fall. Laying her in her crib, it was time for me to get some hot tea and sit by my big windows and watch the snow fall.

Watching the water heat up reminded me of the phrase about watching grass

grow. All in all, my leg was feeling much better, just really sore but even that was going away. My wolf was working double time because she felt like something was brewing and she needed our human form to be in the best shape. I almost forced Jasper to spare with me but I was enjoying the night time routine with Adalynn.

Finally, the water was done boiling, making the tea kettle scream in protest. There wasn't much worry that it would wake Adalynn up but I was still quick to remove it and pour some water in my cup. After adding the tea bag, I went to my favorite chair.

It was so peaceful watching the snow accumulate on the ground. Sipping on my tea, I just sat there for who knows how long until I started to get sleepy.

As [ walked in my pitch black house to

the kitchen, I saw a shadow run past the window.

Jasper did tell me that our warriors were stationed around the house but they wouldn’t be moving that fast.

Everything in me was on high alertasl set my cup in the sink. Another movement to the left, forced me to whip my head around but I missed the wolf.

“Jasper! Who is guarding my house? There is movement outside!” As soon as the mind-link went through, the power shut off in my house. “Fuck!” yelled as I ran to Adalynn’s room. As gently and quickly as I could, I scooped her up and ran back to my chair to grab my phone.

“GET TO THE SAFE ROOM!” Jasper yelled in the mind-link right as

something stepped in front of the window. A big black wolf was standing there, snarling at me.

“1 don’t think I have time.” I whispered back. We stared for a moment, staring at each other before my front door blew open. On instinct, I turned and ran as fast as I could down to the basement. noveldrama

“0h, no you don’t!” I heard behind me.

He was a few steps behind me but he didn’t know the layout. I knew there was a rug and if you turned full speed, it would send you flying. Grabbing the wall, I turned it like I have practiced multiple times. Making it around the corner just as he went flying into the wall. The panic room was Open enough that I was able to just get inside the

door and lay her on the couch before two strong arms wrapped around my waist.

“NO!” Trying to hold into the wall, I could hear more movement and I knew I was too late. Without even thinking, I grabbed the door handle and allowed him to pull the door shut as he pulled me away from the door. I heard it slam shut and lock as I hit the ground.

«stupid bitch!” SLAP! He backhanded me across the face.

“What is going on here?” Anthony’s voice made my stomach crawl in disgust.

«She locked the baby in the panic room.” The warrior stood up and backed away from me.

“Unlock it.”

Looking up at him, my wolf came to the surface. “You can kill me and everyone in this pack before I let you touch a hair on my daughter’s head.”










###Chapter 0593

 “We don’t have time to wait. We need to get that baby and get out.” Anthony snapped his fingers.

“What about the baby?” His warrior asked.

“We will move to plan B.” Anthony sighed and looked around. “Grab her.” Anthony turned around and started walking out of the room. As two warriors moved in, Sierra wasn’t having it. She extended her claws. As one of them grabbed my arm, she slashed him acrossed his neck. With her other hand, she shoved her hand into his chest, Anthony turned around as she pulled out his heart.

Anthony’s face was both amused and annoyed. “Jasper! I need help!” 1 mind-linked him as Anthony took a step towards me.

“You bitch.” His eyes were completely black but Sierra wasn’t having it. She wasn’t going down without out a fight.

“I’m coming! We are being attacked everywhere!” Anthony started swinging and I was on defense. “If I get taken, Adalynn is in the safe room. Make sure she is safe.” Sierra delivered a solid punch to his nose but Anthony barely flinched.

Three warriors walked in right as she was about to kick him in the balls.

“Stay strong! I'm coming!” Jasper said in the mind-link as they circled me,noveldrama

“Either walk out with me or I will knock your ass out and then you will leave with me.” Anthony said as he spit out a wad of blood.

After quickly weighting my options, I decided being awake was going to be in my best interest. “Fine.” €» One warrior grabbed a fist full of my hair and pulled my head back as I walked passed him. Without missing a beat, I turned and punched him hard in the stomach.

“Feisty... I like that.” Another one grabbed my arm and ripped me forward.

“Get OFF of me!” Ripping my arm free, his claws slashed open my arm. Blood started dripping down to my fingertips.

Anthony grabbed my neck and squeezed, making me look him in the eyes. “I suggest you walk quietly before I return the favor and slice your neck.” “And lose your bargaining tool? What would Ann say to that?” I said through clenched teeth. In truth, I was trying to buy as much time as possible.

“Ann has plans for you.” Anthony smirked as he knew I had him that. I hadn't realized my feet where off the ground until he dropped me. My knees buckled, making me fall on my ass.

Before I could even focus, I was ripped up on my feet. Air was still trying to fill my lungs as I was pulled up the stairs.

“Jasper?” | pleaded as we hit the main level, Two warriors walked in with Vivian

between them. “Oh, good. The baby is in the panic room. Get her.” Anthony stopped walked and looked at Vivian.

“Yes. Of course.” Vivian gave me a dirty smile as she walked past me.

Utter and complete betrayal spread through me as I watched Vivian skip down stairs. “Jasper, Vivian is a spy.

She is working with Anthony.” “This is where I have to make sure you don’t fuck up any more of my plans.” Anthony said to me. As soon as I looked up at him, a white cloth wrapped around my face. Cloroform penetrated my nose even without breathing. I was coherent enough to see Vivian walk upstairs with my daughter before blackness took over.

Alec POV

Three times. Three times I have tried to call Kristen and didn’t get an answer.

Tossing my phone on the bed, it was all I could do but pace. She has never been this mad that she has ignored me. It just felt wrong. Me being here. Sending Kristen away. Maybe keeping mates together will make them stronger.

Right now, I felt weak.

RING!” RING!” “About fucking time.” I muttered to myself. Practically lunging for the phone, I saw it was Jasper calling.

“He-" Jasper cut me off. “We got attacked.

Anthony was here and got Kristen and Adalynn. Vivian was a spy! It was Vivian.” Jasper coughed a few time and spit before continuing, My heart sank as my throat choked up.

“We have prisoners but Anthony took a helicopter. You need to get to / Anthony's pack and hide there. Wait for the helicopter to land and then attack. I don’t know that is where they are headed but you have to get them back. I couldn’t make it in time.” My head swam as I tried to process it.

Kristen was kidnapped and so was Adalynn. My entire world was in the hands of Anthony. I couldn’t respond to Jasper. I didn’t even hang up before I released the most dangerous growl I have ever embodied before throwing my phone against the wall.

Not bothering to even turn the door handle, I just kicked the door open.

Wood went flying in every direction as what was left of the door slammed against the wall in the hallway. Not waiting for a respond, my foot landed

on Colt’s door, making the door splinter. His back was towards me, making him immediately get into the attack position. &» “Anthony attacked my pack already.

He has Kristen and Adalynn.” Colt stood up and registered what I said as Jace and Lars came out of their rooms.

“What the fuck, Alec?” Jace asked, looking around.

I had him pinned against the wall with my forearm against his throat.

“Anthony attacked my pack. Kristen and Adalynn have been kidnapped. My fucking daughter has been KIDNAPPED!” I yelled in his face. I watched as Jace’s eyes got large as saucers as he comprehended what | just said.

“What do you need?” Jace asked.

“Get your warriors ready. We are going to beat the fucking helicopter back and we are going to get my mate and my daughter back.” Pushing him back, I took a few steps back. “Give me your phone.” Jace handed me my phone before him and Lars took off. “Who are you calling?” Colt’s wolf asked. I had to double take as I shift through him contacts. Finally landing on Maddox, I hit send.











###Chapter 0594 

“I told you I would talk to you in two days. Wh-" “Anthony attacked my pack and kidnapped Kristen and my fucking daughter!” I screamed in the phone.

“Already?” There was papers shifting around. “I assumed he would wait at least a few days before he attacked.” “What do you fucking mean, already? You knew this would put a target on our back. On my fucking back?” “Give me one hour and then we will head that way. Figure out a plan and Pll'help you get them back.” Click! |

Frustration got to better of me as used every ounce of muscle I had and threw the phone against the wall. | Instead of shattering, the phone embedded in the wall.

“We will get them back.” Colt said as he picked up his phone. I knew who he was calling and I didn’t want to hear it.

Walking out, I made my way down to Jace’s office.

Men were running around but everyone took a wide birth around me.

Jace should be happy that his door was fucking opened and no one was sitting at his desk when I walked in. Sitting down, I picked up his phone and dialed Jasper’s number, “Beta Jasper.” He answered after the third ring. He sounded worn out and tired.

“Report.” “Oh. There was two teams. First one { came in and caused more chaos than anything. Almost immediately, I got a mind-link from Kristen saying she was under attack. The warriors that were guarding her house were executed by a long range sniper. They were in the house before she even knew it. By the looks of things and what she told me, she managed to get Adalynn in the panic room before she was caught. She killed two warriors before they overpowered her. Vivian was brought in and Kristen told me she was... is the spy. Vivian was the one that got into the panic room and got Adalynn. There was chloroform in your livingroom.

I’m assuming that is how they got Kristen to stop fighting, 1 already have warriors from our pack and Colt’s pack

headed your way by helicopter and by car. They are moving as quickly as possible but I'm not sure when they will get there.” “Casualties?” “Eight.” Closing my eyes, I just firmly gripped the phone as I tapped it against my forehead. “Okay.” “Alec?” Jasper said after a moment.

“What?” “Kill him. Kill him and bring Kristen and Adalynn back. I wish I was going to be there with you when you do it. You are my best friend and... we need this, We need them dead.” | Icould hear how much sorrow and pain

that was going through Jasper. He has grown to think of Kristen as his sister.

They have a weird bond but it was one that really made me happy to see her comfortable with my pack.

“Alec, there is a helicopter approaching.” My eyes looked up and locked with Lars. noveldrama

“It’s my men.” He nodded before turning to leave. At the last second, he stopped and pulled himself back into eye sight. “We are leaving in five minutes.” “I gotta go.” I'told Jasper before hanging the phone up. It was hard to focus but I managed to pull myself up and get to my room. Putting on the same clothes as before, it was easy to get ready in just a few minutes. The bag was still packed so | somehow

made it down stairs just in time.

Jace was on the phone in front of all his men. He looked up at me before he sighed and hung up. “Maddox said their helicopter had already landed. No word if Kristen and Adalynn were on Fra “Well if Maddox said it then it must be true.” I said extremely sarcastically before tossing my bag down against the wall.

“We are still going to attack.” Jace kept going, ignoring my comment. “We are going to do things a little different though.” “What's the plan?” Kristen's POV ~My stomach rolled as I started coming around, Before I could even focus on

anything, I had to leave off to the side and emptied everything that was left inside me. My head was pounding and what I could see was spinning around in circles.

“Wakey, wakey!” Ann’s voice shrieked.

SLAP! My head snapped to the side so fast that my neck cracked half a dozen times. The bitter taste of blood filled my mouth, making it fun to spit back out at her.

“You think you won?” I said as I tried to focus as hard as I could. The more that came into focus, the faster my heart raced. I was in an old house, my arms and legs were chained down and I had to fight off the deja vu that rattled my bones. The windows were covered with pieces of wood, the dust was

inches thick and the smell of mildew hung in the air. However, it was the containers of gasoline that really caused me concern.

“I know I have. You see, we have the perfect plan. After we finish you off, we are going to take this sweet girl and raise her as our own.” My eyes landed on Adalynn. She was sleeping in Ann’s arms. “Alec will never rest until she is found.” “He will be searching for quite some time. You see, this abandoned house is not anywhere close to my pack. They will attack my pack and take it over, We knew from the start that I wouldn’t win a war against Colt and Alec. After Rip died, you were too big, However, my hatred of Colt and Ann’s hatred of you has worked out well for us. We

emptied all of our bank accounts and are abandoning the pack.” Anthony walked closer to me.

“Maybe somewhere warmer. Like the ocean.” Ann seemed to be in a deep thought as Anthony punched me hard in the nose.











###Chapter 0595

 “What is your goal?” My face was tingly. Once he stopped hitting me, my wolf just wanted to buy time. Alec wouldn’t rest until we are found and Anthony was talking.

By this time, Adalynn started waking up. The time between when she wakes up and demands food is very limited.

Part of me found this funny but I still didn’t want that bitch touching my daughter.

“Knowing that you are dead and all the responsibilities are gone will make me sleep good at night. Colt and Alec will be searching for years and never find your body or find Adalynn. Oh, actually, her name is now Amanda.

Amanda, Ann and Anthony. Has a nice

ring to it, huh?” Adalynn was fully awake now and looking right at me. Tears were streaming down her face as she held her arms out to me. “Momma.” She cried. It was her first word and it was momma. My heart broke into a million pieces as I wanted to hold my baby.

“I’m your momma now.” Ann said. noveldrama

Iwas so focused on Ann that I didn’t realize Anthony walked behind me. “I read and listened to what Darin did to you.” He whispered in my ear.

Ice cold fear ran down my body before I started shaking. His hands wrapped around my neck and moved slightly under my shirt. “Excuse me. I don’t think so!” Ann sneered. & “Aw, come on baby. It will be fun!”

“If you touch that filth, I will leave.” Ann looked daggers at Anthony. Never J in my life did I think I would be happy to have Ann on my side but here we are.

“Fine.” Anthony sighed. Before I knew it, he grabbed my shoulders and ripped them out of their sockets. “That should do it. Now, to add something new.” The pain was a making me go back to the abandoned building and I wasn’t sure where I was for a moment. Darin’s laughter filtered in with Anthony’s but it was Adalynn that brought me back.

Her cries forced my wolf to knock out the bad feelings and get back to reality.

“Even if I die here today, you will be dead very soon.” | threatened.

Anthony had grabbed the gasoline

containers and was splashing it on the walls and the floor. “Ann, why don’t you wait outside.” Anthony said as he tossed one empty container on the floor before grabbing another one.

“Okay. I think she is hungry so I can get her a snack while we are outside.” Ann grabbed Adalynn’s hand and forced her to wave at me. “Say goodbye!” “See you in hell.” It was more of a promise than anything but Ann didn’t take me seriously. Instead, she smirked before walking up to me.

Pulling her hand back, she slapped me across the face. “Just for old time’s sake.” Laughing, she turned and walked outside, “She really is something, isn’t she?” Anthony looked at Ann with a

sickening love struck look on his face.

“Yeah, a piece of trash.” I said as I spit some more blood out.

“You are about to die and all you can say is some sarcastic remark?” Anthony finished emptying the second container.

“It’s a gift really.” Anthony grabbed the last container and moved to the other rooms. The chains were tightly around my wrist and since my shoulders were out of place, I wasn’t able to move them at all.

I was going to be burning here shorty and there wasn’t much | could do about it.

My wolf was trying to heal me as quickly as she could but even she

couldn’t put my shoulders back into place. The chair was nailed down to the floor, making it impossible to move it.

The only thing I could see out the window was Ann getting into the car with a very upset Adalynn.

“This is where our fun time comes to an end.” Anthony knelt down in front of me. His hands were on my thighs, more intimately than I would have liked. “I had other plans but ’'m a flexible guy. I just wanted to make sure you knew exactly what was going to | happen when you die.” He got up and moved so he was straddling my lap.

“Have your fun now because it won’t be lasting long.” | barely got the words out when he grabbed a fist full of my hair and ripped my head back.

“So feisty.” His eyes swam with pleasure. “I would have liked to fuck that spirit out of you. You should be thankful that I’m on a tight time line.” He lips pressed against mine firmly.

His hand forced my head to stay in place as his tongue raided my mouth.

His fingers pushed my cheeks on top of my teeth so I couldn’t bite his tongue.

Thankfully, he let me go and got up.

Tears threatened to fall but I was going to stay strong. My wolf was not about to let me fall apart. No, I was too strong for that. It was in that moment that I realized just how weak I was after Darin. How I kept my emotions so far down that I wasn’t able to handle what happened to me. In this very moment, | was able to truly look Anthony in the eyes and know that this wasn’t going

to break me.

“Fuck. You.” I spat.

“I would if I could but unfortunately, I can’t grant you that wish. You will just have to die a horny girl.” Anthony laughed before lighting the match.

“I might die tonight but you will never be more wanted than you are now. Alec will come for you. Colt will not rest until Adalynn is back. You think you have won? You haven’t won anything.

| Every morning, you will look out the windows, hoping you don’t see Alec and Colt. You will jump at every sound, every squeak of the floor board and at every shadow. I will be haunting your every move. Mark my words, that smile will be gone very soon.” Anthony listened to me before he just turned and walked out the building, |

watched him walk towards his vehicle and toss the match on the ground.












###Chapter 0596 

It was slow motion but so fast that I couldn’t form a single word in my mind. Between the time he dropped the match and the time the entire room was on fire was longer than you think.

My eyes followed the fire as it traveled around the room but it was still so fast that a huge gust of hot air blew my hair all over. Black smoke circled around me, filling my lungs and making it hard to see.

Between the spikes of fire, I watched as Anthony smiled before getting into the vehicle and driving off. The further my daughter got from me, the more angry Sierra got. Forcing me in the back, she was taking control. Blisters had started for form on my skin but she barely even noticed.

NE VV, She was too big to transform in this room, so instead, she just used her power to try and get the chair to move.

The sheer force of her using my legs to rock the chair was working on each nail but also pushing down on my wrist. The more she pushed and pulled, the more my wrist was giving out.

My lungs were so choked up on smoke that it was even hard for Sierra to keep going at that pace. After a second of collecting herself, she gave it one last push. At the same time the nails gave out, so did my wrist. The chain snapped my wrist. Falling on the ground, my body was in so much pain.

Each shoulder was out, my wrist was broken, ribs and nose were broken but I was alive. The fire was so thick that I was having a hard time even keeping my eyes open but I'had to get out. I

couldn’t stay here. I couldn’t die here.

“Get up!” Hands grabbed my arms and ripped me to my feet.

“AHH!” I screamed in pain. I couldn’t see who it was but they didn’t give me a second to figure it out. Their hand gripped my left arm and snapped my shoulder in place before slinging it around their shoulder. Wrapping his arm around my waist, they forced me to move.

I couldn’t see, couldn’t breath and all I knew was the fire that whipped at my body. The next thing I knew was laying on the grass. “Shit.” Whoever my savor was muttered.

The fresh air burned as it replaced the smoke, making me cough so violently _ that I thought a lung was going to

come out. A sharp pain shot down my body as my other shoulder got hastily put back into it’s socket.

My wolf was so pissed that she was working double time to get everything back into place. “Breathe!” I heard a man’s voice pull at my face. His hands wrapped around my cheeks as if he was examining every inch of me. However, there wasn’t any tingles.

The pain that was blanketed my body was unlike anything else I felt. Forcing my eyes open, I watched as my savor cut my clothes and pulled the fabric off my melted flesh. Pieces of tissue were stuck to the fabric, exposing raw muscle underneath it.

“Drink this.” A water bottle was being pushing into my face, making me look at the man that saved me.

“H-how?” My voice was raspy as I tried to speak. Taking the water, Gunther kept going on removing my clothes carefully.

“I know this hurts but I have to remove this before the fabric grows back into your body. This won't take long for your wolf to heal so I have to move quickly.” He said as he ignored my question.

Looking up, The house was fully engulfed and part of the wall had fallen in on itself. Gunther saved my life.

“Where are we?” “Just an old abandoned house that Anthony used as a safe house.” Gunther seemed annoyed that I was even asking questions.

“Does Alec know where I am?” I asked _ as Gunther started working on mynoveldrama

shirt.

“No. Shit is hitting the fan so I took a hunch and it paid off.” Gunther sat back and looked at me. “I need you to lean forward.” As gently as I could, I sat forward. “Is my back okay?” “Actually, yes. You can lay back down on your back. I need to get the rest of your shirt off. I'm sorry but I have to touch you to do that.” My eyes traveled down. Realizing that my shirt had melted into my chest and on my breast was not something I was looking forward to but he was right.

“That’s fine.” I said as I allowed him to help me lay down. It actually felt better on my ribs anyway.

Sierra had refocused her energy on my

legs so they weren't hurting as much as they did. “Alpha Alec is attacking Anthony’s pack right now.” His hands pushed my breast to the side so he could peel off some of my shirt that was stuck between my breast. It almost felt like if he distracted himself, he wouldn’t be so uncomfortable. His hands were shaking but I couldn’t decide if it was nerves or if he was afraid I was going to kill him.

“Anthony is headed to a beach. He is abandoning his pack and they are taking Adalynn to raise her as their own.” Gunther stopped working and froze.

His hand was cupping my breast but his attention was now on me. “He said that?” “Yeah. He told me he was leaving

behind the responsibilities and going to relax on a beach.” I had to cough a few times but my lungs were feeling better. Sierra’s energy level was getting low but she powered on.

“If he abandoned his pack....” Gunther was working something out in his own mind.

“Gunther?” He seemed to not hear me.

“GUNTHER!” I yelled. It was painful and sent me into another coughing fit.

“What?” His eyes snapped down to mine.

“Can you ponder what that means when your hand isn’t holding my boob and you are done cleaning my wounds?”









###Chapter 0597

 Alec POV “Where the fuck is Maddox?” We were headed towards Anthony’s pack.

Literally everyone single warrior Jace had and the ones that Jasper sent me, were all headed towards Anthony.

“He isn’t answering.” Jace was angry.

This became a shit show really fast.

“Stop the cars!” I demanded. We were a few miles from Anthony’s pack and I was going to be walking up to them, looking them in the eye and killing anyone who stands between me and my mate and daughter.

“Everyone out! We are moving on foot!” Lars commanded. There wasn't any use in being quiet. This was war

and we had them outnumbered. Colt and I didn’t wait for everyone to get out and get ready. I didn’t give a shit if they needed to pee or grab their guns.

My men were on the same page. Not a single person dared to take their time or mutter a single word. They fell behind me as we lead the way.

Jace and Lars were excellent alphas but they didn’t have as much invested in this as we did. I could hear them scrambling behind us as they fell into step but neither one of them walked up beside us. This was our show and our fight.

The closer we got, the more my warning bells were going off. Usually, we would spot cameras or some random warriors that were on the lookout for this kind of attack but there wasn’t any. The surveillance system

seemed to be turned off. There wasn’t any birds chirping, no squirrels were running around. It was quiet.


As we approached their territory, the boarder patrol was gone. The gate was wide open and not a single person stood there. Raising my fist, signally everyone to halt. In the distance, I saw a single person walking towards us.

“Hold.” I said, firmly. As much as I wanted to flatten the entire pack, I wasn’t sure who this person was that was walking towards me. The power that I got from him was of a gamma, someone I could easily overpower.

His small stature was surprising but I knew looks were deceiving. Each arm was extremely defined but the purpose of a gamma was to protect the luna andnoveldrama

blending into a crowd was part of that.

He wasn’t walking aggressively. His hands were swinging around his side but his palms were facing up as if he was saying he wasn’t a threat. “Alpha Alec?” He asked finally as he came to the entrance of his territory.

Taking a step forward, I looked directly into his eyes. “That’s me.” He took a minute to look behind him before he turned back to me. “I know why you are here and I can assure you, we are not the enemy.” “Your alpha kidnapped my luna and my daughter.” I started taking a few steps towards him.

“For my alpha’s sins I will surely pay but please just listen!” He pleaded as 1

came up to him. Wrapping my hand around his neck, his feet left the grass.

“NO!” I heard a women scream in the distance. Looking behind him, I saw her fall to her knees in agony.

The guy tried to look behind him but I kept him facing forward. “Please! Just listen to me before you kill me!” He struggled to get the words out.

Putting him back on his feet, it took everything in me to not just snap his neck. “Better make it good.” “Alpha Anthony left us.” He coughed as he tried to talk.

“Left you?” Colt asked as he stepped forward.

“Yes. He denounced his ties. Alp- Anthony abandoned us. Two

helicopters left for something and only one returned. The warriors that went said he kidnapped your luna and daughter. However, he took them on a different helicopter somewhere else.

The plan was to bring them back here and force you to sit down to discuss a peace treaty. He knew you were bigger and we didn’t stand a chance if it came to a war but when he didn’t come back, I knew. It was only a few minutes ago that he denounced his ties to this pack.” I was shocked. He played his own pack.

He lied to his warriors about what was going to happen. “Where is my luna and daughter?” I asked, half way not caring about their alpha problem.

“I don’t know sir. However, we do not want to fight. We know we will lose and we want to preserve our lives if

possible. I am out here, hoping you would consider sparing us. The entire pack, women and children included are in the large gym. We have no weapon and we ask that you grant us pardon.

You can have free rein over the pack house and over Anthony’s office. The pack is lost and unsure what to do. We need an alpha but we don’t want to die for the sins of Anthony. We surrender to you and are willing to listen to your direction in exchange for our lives.” “You don’t know where he took Kristen?” “I don’t but like I said, you can go to his office and look at it.” “What is your name?” Colt asked. He sounded just as confused as we were.

“Oliver.” Grabbing his arm, I pulled him with me. “If you are lying, you will be the first to die.” I growled as we marched our way inside.

“Understood.” He said with more confidence that I expected.

“Where is the gym?” Colt asked.

“To the left.” The woman stood up. Tears ran down her face. It was clear she wanted to run to him but he must have been telling her to stop because she backed up and let us pass without issue.

The pack was a ghost town. Nota single soul was walking around. No one was in windows looking at us. The packhouse was visible on the right. I had to double look but there was a pile

of guns, ammo and who knows what else in front of the steps. Almost like they deposited everything in attempt to not get killed.









###Chapter 0598 

“Right there.” Oliver pointed to a rather large building that was shaped in a big circle. The dome had a clear glass top but it was how every single door was opened wide. The closer we got, the more I could see people huddled together in the center of the floor. Their warriors were standing guard but as promised, no weapons.

Only their soft cries and whimpers were being heard as we walked inside.

The men all straightened their backs but bowed in respect. “We mean no harm.” One man who was brave enough said to me. noveldrama

Women were laying on top of their children as if to shield them from me.

“None of us wanted Ann to begin with and none of what he did was a reflection on how we felt.” Oliver whispered as I looked at Colt.

We shared a look before looking back at the people before us. “Jace?” I looked around for him.

“Yeah?” “We are going to look at Anthony’s office. Stay here and guard everyone.

Wait for my instruction.” “Okay.” He didn’t dare argue with me as I took Oliver and headed towards the packhouse.

“Time is running out if he took Kristen to a different location.” Colt muttered.

“She is still alive.” I said with full

confidence.

“Better be.” Colt’s wolf said.

“You don’t have any idea where they might be?” Jerking Oliver up the steps of the packhouse, he lead us towards the office.

“I don’t. I swear. I will pledge my allegiance to you right now if you want to prove my innocense. We didn’t know what he was planning.” Oliver showed up the door but it was locked. Handing Oliver to Colt, I took a few steps back before using all my strength to kick the door down. It was probably a little much but it was more to get some frustration out.

His office looked to be ransacked.

Papers were on the floor, folders were opened but my eyes landed on the

shredder that was full. “Did someone else look in here before we got here?” Colt asked.

“No. This was honestly how his office looked all the time.” Colt put Oliver against the wall. To Oliver’s credit, he stood straight with his hands folded in front of him. He didn’t move or even look at the door.

“This is just trash. Brochures on a beaches?” Colt tossed them to the side and kept going. “Here is folders on each of our packs.” That caught my attention. “Anything interesting?” I mean, we all had them so it wasn’t very unusual.

“Yeah. This is a had written schedule.” Colt handed me a piece of paper.

“That’s Vivian's handwriting.”

“Where is Vivian?” Colt looked at Oliver. } “Oh, um...” Oliver looked panic for a second. “I think she was with Anthony in that helicopter. I know for a fact she didn’t come back with the one. I even asked the pilot where they all were and he didn’t know.” “She had been keeping tabs on you guys since the beginning.” Colt pulled out more stuff. It was details about our basic lifestyles. How much she watched Adalynn, when we liked to shower or what foods we ate. There was a written diagram of the floor plan.

“She must have watched us program our fingerprints and put her own in there. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be any possible way for her to get Adalynn out of the panic room.” I tried to

rationalize it.

“Kristen must not have known because if she thought Adalynn was safe in the room, she wouldn’t have opened it.” Colt kept going with my thoughts as if we were one.

“She would have let everyone die before that door got opened. Anthony must have known that and brought her out of hiding otherwise he would have kept her under wraps. Since she was his only back up plan, that probably forced him to move quicker.” Colt looked at me. “His plan was to always abandoned the pack. He knew we were stronger and would be able to take him down, even without Jace and Lars’s help. He never stood a chance.” “He had been planning this after he

found Ann in your cells.” It all fell into place and how we fed right into his plan.

“He could be anywhere.” Colt closed his eyes.

Looking at Oliver, he seemed to just be intently listening. “Where would Anthony go? Does he have a vacation property?” “He wouldn't go there.” Colt started pacing. “He wouldn't go anywhere that he has paper ties to. It would be somewhere that isn’t linked to him at all.” “Ann likes the sun. Maybe somewhere south?” Oliver whispered.

“The mountains provide more coverage.” Colt argued.

“Would it be remote or over populated

area?” I tried to think out loud so they could bounce ideas off me.

“A populated area would provide a certain level of coverage but it would also open you up to rogue attacks.

Since he isn’t an alpha anymore, he doesn’t have that extra strength that comes with it.” Colt kept going.

Oliver chimed in. “However, he is still a skilling fighter and probably believes he could defeat anyone. His ego is huge.” “Where would he take Kristen?” I asked, hoping Oliver would have a suggestion there.

“I don’t know. There are abandoned buildings everywhere in the mountains. He could have went to any one of them. He didn’t have a favorite house he used.”

“Do you have any su-" Colt’s phone started to ring. After looking at the caller I.D. His body froze.

After hitting send, he hit speaker phone. “Gunther?” “Fucking about time someone answered! I’ve been trying to get ahold of Alec for hours!” “In case you haven’t fucking heard, we are a little busy. What do you want?” Colt growled back.

“That’s why I am calling. I had a hunch and it paid off.” “If you don’t start talking, I am going to hang up.” Colt pinched the bridge of his nose.

There was a little shuffling on his side before anyone spoke again, “Colt?” The voice that came through the phone

sounded like Kristen if she smoked a pack of cigarettes.











###Chapter 0599

“Okay. Do you have a plan for this?” Lars asked, looking around.

Colt looked at me before answering.

Other than keeping a chunk for ourselves to vacation on, split the land between you two. Everyone can decide which pack they want to join and we can merge the way we did after we took out Rip. Anyone who disagrees can go to the cells. Get the shit out of the packhouse and burn the bitch.” Colt said loudly for anyone and everyone to hear.

“Are you sure? This is your victory.” Jace looked between us.

«We can finalize details when we have Kristen and Adalynn back.” I'said, not giving a fuck who gets what piece of land. Turning around, I walked out of the gym.

To my surprise, Oliver followed. “I'll come too. I know the land and where we can go.” “Fine but if you impede me at all, I will not hesitate to end you.” I made sure that threat was fully received and stared him down.

Oliver took a step back and nodded. “I understand.” He said before he went back to following me. “I would like to join your pack.” He said with more confidence.

Chapter 0599 “Kristen?” I practically ripped the phone out of Colt’s hands.

“Alec?” There was clearly some relief in her voice. “Is that you?” “Yes, love. It's me. Where are you? Are you okay?” “Um...I'm alive. Listen, Anthony took Adalynn. He told me he was going to some beach and he was going to leave behind his responsibilities.” «1 know. We are standing in his office right now.” Colt stepped forward. “You said he was going to a beach?” “yeah, That is what Ann said.” Colt started looking around before

dropping to the floor. After tossing some papers around, he stood up with a brochure of Florida. “He went to Florida.” “What's in Florida?” Oliver asked.

The room was silent for a moment.

“That is where dad hid mom’s stuff.” Kristen said after a moment.

That’s when I remembered when we went down there. That beach was special to them. It wasn’t a hugely popular area but it was somewhere I could see Ann wanting to live there as a final fuck you to Kristen and Colt.

«1 know where that is at.” I said finally.

“I’m going with you.” Kristen said.

Gunther whispered something angrily to Kristen and she was whispering

back. noveldrama

“What's wrong?” Colt asked, looking alarmed at me.

“GIVE IT BACK!” Kristen yelled front a distance.

“Sir, Luna Kristen is not in any shape to go to the beach. The risk of infection is too high and she needs a hospital.” Closing my eyes, I didn’t even think about the condition she was in. The fact she was alive was all I was concerned about. “Tell me what kind of condition she is in.” Colt demanded.

Gunther took a deep breath. “They tried to burn her alive. By the time I got here, the house was inflamed and he was driving off. I was going to stop him

from leaving but I saw Kristen tied to a chair. The whole house was engulfed in flames. However, I got her out-and I've been peeling the melted fabric from her skin. You know what happens to your tissue when fabric is burned against it. She is covered from head to toes in blisters.” Gunther spit it all out without taking a breath.

Closing my eyes, I had to rein in my anger from doing something I shouldn’t do. “Give her the phone.” My wolf said.

Gunther didn’t even argue as I heard Kristen bite Gunther’s head off for that. “My wolf is healing me and my legs almost look good. I don’t care what you say, Alec. This is my fight and I am going to finish this once and for all. Ann is mine to kill and these burns aren't going to stop me from doing

that.” “Not that I want her to come but your wolf will be able to speed up the healing process. She’s right. This fight is ours. We will be the ones to kill them.” Colt said, backing me into a corner.

“Where are you?” I didn’t like it but I understood it.

There was some shuffling before Gunther’s voice came back on. “It would be easier if you just got on the helicopter and followed the smoke in the sky. We are to the north.” «Phat works, then we can head straight to Florida.” I head Kristen said.

“No.” Gunther argued. “You need to be treated accordingly. Plus, the

helicopter needs to be fueled. I know you don’t like this but they aren’t going to hurt Adalynn. You need to let them think they got away with this. Let them get settled in and then you attack. Luna Kristen, you are in very close to not making it to even see your daughter.” The fact that Gunther was even arguing this with Kristen really made me worry. “I know this sucks but he is right. We need to make sure Kristen doesn’t die too.” Colt said quietly to me.

I didn’t like it but I knew I wasn’t emotionally able to make this call.

Turning around, I walked passed Oliver and out of the packhouse. Colt was behind me with Oliver as he rattled off a few things to Gunther before hanging up.

We practically ran to the gym.

Everyone was right were we left them.

“Jace! Lars!” I growled loudly. Most of the people had relaxed and didn’t realized we came back so when I yelled, there was a few screams in fear.

“What happened?” Jace asked instantly.

“1,00k who's here.” Lars said as Maddox walked up beside him.

Seeing a face that I could punch, I didn’t even hesitate. Pulling my arm back, I cold clocked him without him even realizing what was happening.

Most of the women screamed in fear as Maddox’s body hit the ground.

«we found Kristen. We are heading that way now on the helicopter. I need you to handle this.” Colt said, quickly.






###Chapter 0600 

Kristen POV Gunther hung up the phone and looked down at me. “How did you find me? Don’t get me wrong, I am very thankful but how?” Gunther sighed and sat down. “I'had a friend in that pack. He allowed me to hide out there as I tried to gather information and do what Colt wanted me to. I was there when Alec and all of them came in. They did a great job of terrorizing everything. It allowed me to hide in plain sight and ease drop on conversations. Ann was the one that suggested you get burned alive so Anthony said he would take you to an abandoned house. It took me awhile to get to you because I was having to go

from house to house to see which on you were at.” “Well, thank you for saving my life.

) I’m not sure how much longer I would have survived.” “Shit. Your wolf is deadly. She was working on getting you out as it was.” Gunther looked up at the sky. The sounds of a distant helicopter was approaching. Standing up, he had to shield his eyes from the sun.

«We are under some trees that isn’t going to allow them to land. We need to move to a clearing that is about a hundred yards out.” Gunther said.

Following his gaze, I watched as the helicopter circled us and then moved to :as “wonderful.” the East to land. “Wondertul.

“Keep that feisty spirit. vou will need it

to heal.” Gunther lifted a corner of his mouth up as he knelt down to pick me up.

“Is it really that bad?” I asked as through gritted teeth.

Gunther glanced down at me. I was pretty exposed so he was trying to avoid eye contact with me. Even him holding me, he tried to keep me at arms length. “Yes.” Was all he said. noveldrama

Looking behind him, I watched as the fire started sizzling out. Only a small flame was left but everything was still pulsating red. “KRISTEN!” Alec voice boomed acrossed the forest before I heard his footsteps.

“He’s not going to kill me for holding you, is he?” Gunther asked, quickly and quietly.

“No.” I'had to hide my laugh as Alec and Colt came into view.

“Kristen!” Alec’s eyes widen as he took on my appearance.

“Is it really that bad?” I asked as I reached for him.

Alec gently took me from Gunther but didn’t try to kiss me. “It’s bad. You need to get to a hospital.” “Thank you.” Colt held out his hand to Gunther.

“It was the right thing to do.” Guther looked rather uncomfortable.

«you could have let her die. You have my trust.” Colt vowed. Gunther looked shocked. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he came around to say anything.

“Twon’t break it.” Alec looked at him. “Thank you.” He said, sincerely. “Do you want a ride?” “No. I am going to stay and make sure the fire gets put out. Don’t want to start a forest fire.” Gunther took a few steps back.

“I’11 send some men out here to help you.” Colt promised as Alec turned and started walking back to the helicopter.

Their conversation became background noise. “I'm sorry I couldn’t protect Adalynn.” «you have nothing to be sorry for. You did everything in your power.” Alec was feeling a few different things.

Mainly, I could feel his wolf push

energy through our bond. However, he was not mad at me or felt anyway over the fact I didn’t protect Adalynn, It was only my guilt that I was feeling.

“I'm going to survive this...right?” I asked quietly as the helicopter came into view.

Alec didn’t answer but he walked faster to the helicopter. As he put me on, there was other guy I didn’t know but he was looking at me, weirdly. Colt came running up behind us.

“I am a trained EMT. Can I help you?” He asked me. I was struggling to sit up correctly and my wrist was still angled in a awkward position.

Colt got on and signaled to the pilot to take off. “What are you going to do?” 1 asked.

“Your body is completely covered in burns. It is about to get really windy and you are able to feel a lot of pain.

The name is Oliver.” “Okay.” I started to feel what he was saying and my body started shaking.

“Get on the floor and lay down.” Oliver unbuckled himself. “Make sure we don’t fly out.” He told Alec and Colt as he reached behind him and grabbed a first aid kit.

It hurt like a bitch to get on the ground but I did. First thing he did was take my wrist in his hands. I knew what he was going to do so I didn’t need to tell him I was ready. Instead, I reached for Alec’s hand and held on. After a moment, he pulled and pushed on my wrist, making a sickening snap.

“FUCK!” I growled. My eyes were closed so I wasn’t aware of what he was using but he put something firm under my wrist and started wrapping it.

“What is on her arms?” Colt asked.

“That would be burn marks made from mental. Unfortunately, those will probably scar since they are so deep.

Looks like mental chains were used to hold her down.” “The chains were nailed to the chair, which was nailed on the floor. My wrist snapped when I managed to break through.” I honestly didn’t even think about the mental chains. Opening my eyes, I tired to look at my arms and could clearly see the pattern that ran down them and across my chest.

“Whoever got your clothes off did a

hd great job.” Oliver muttered more to himself. Opening gauze packets, he drenched them in saline before putting them on my wounds. It stung at first but the pain eventually faded. “This might kill all your nerves.” “You mean to tell me she won’t be able to feel her body?” Alec asked.








###Chapter 0601

 “I’m saying it's a possibility.” Oliver didn’t seemed phased by Alec’s annoyance. Instead, he kept going on dressing my wounds. He didn’t even ask as he went around and covered my chest. “Take off your shirts and put them on top of her now. It will help protect against the wind.” Alec and Colt instantly listened. Oliver put their shirts around me and even tucked them under me gently. It greatly helped enough that my body stopped shaking.

«Those burn marks will make fora great tattoo.” I said looking up at Alec.

Alec shook his head and turned his head away from me. He found that

comment a little funny but I had a dark sense of humor. “Ice, if you got tattooed everything you were hurt, there wouldn’t be any skin left.” Colt bickered back.

“It would show that you can’t take me out. What? I’ve been beaten, drowned, stabbed, shot and now burned and I'm still here.” “The strongest person I know.” Colt said.

«guck.” Oliver muttered and shook his head. He backed away from me.

“Are we almost there?” Alec asked the pilot.

«wo minutes out.” He responded instantly.

“Maybe we should build our own hospitals.” Colt muttered as they

watched the hospital under us.

Oliver shifted to see as the helicopter { descended. “Good. There looks to be a burn unit ready for us.” I think he muttered it more to himself than to us but it was nice to know they were ready for us anyway. As soon as the helicopter touched down, voices were yelling instructions and people where everywhere.

“Alec?” 1 asked in the mind-link. I had to close my eyes since the wind was snapping my hair in my face.

«I'm here, love. Let them treat you. I'm not leaving you.” Everything happened so fast. An LV.

was put in and I was instantly given pain medicine. The gauze was gently pulled off and they started cleaning the wounds. I could hear some of the

nurses talk about how good they were healing and how my wolf was doing a great job. Sa Something cold was placed in the wounds and I even heard the word tissue grafting. The pain medicine was making everything sound far away and it was a struggle to stay awake.

“Don’t fight it. Just sleep for now.” Alec said in my mind. I didn’t need being told twice and I stopped fighting it. Blackness took over and the pain was gone.

[ wasn’t sure how long I was asleep but as I started coming around, I could hear Alec speaking with someone.

“Alec?” I said in the mind-link.

«you're awake?” I could feel the relief spread through him.

“What's happening? Am I okay?” “Everything is fine. They will take the bandages off here soon. Your wolf has done an amazing job healing you. My wolf has been pushing more energy towards you and the hospital gave me some I.V.s to keep my energy up so I can keep healing you. They believe you will be completely healed in a few days.” “That’s awesome. So, I am going to live.” I tried to open my eyes but there was something wrapped around it.

“Oh yeah, you have many more years with me.” Something touched my fingers but didn’t try holding my hand.

The tingles were nice and welcoming feeling.

«when do we leave to get Adalynn back?”

“Hopefully tomorrow. I send scouts down there to figure out where exactly they are staying. When we take you home tonight, we will have a meeting about how it is all going to happen.” “T just want her back.” “Me too.” I could feel Alec’s hand on my head from the pressure but I missed the sparks.

“1s she awake?” I heard Colt’s voice from across the room.

“She is.” «How is she feeling?” Colt asked.

«1,ike a million bucks.” I told Alec. My mouth was covered and only my nose was exposed so it wasn’t like I could answer for myself.

“She said she feels good.” Alec replied for me.

“Fucking liar.” I muttered. = “That’s good.” Colt muttered as the door opened.

“We are here to undress the wounds and see how they look. Is it only if we start?” I heard a female voice ask sweetly.

“yeah. She is awake and ready to talk again.” Alec muttered as he took his hand off my head.

“Alright. Miss Kristen, we are going to be unwrapping your body now. I'l start with your head and work our way down. That way you can tell us if you are in any pain.” “Let's get this over with.” I told Alec in

the mind-link.

“She said okay.” Alec responded.

“We really need to work on you talking for me.” I tried to make my tone displeasing but Alec just snorted.

My head started moving front and back a few times as they unwrapped it all.

“you will probably need a few hair cut.” She said as the light from the room got brighter.

«can we turn the lights off?” IT asked Alec.

“Is it possible to turn the lights off? She is a little sensitive right now.” Alec asked. noveldrama

«oh! Of course.” The nurse flipped the lights off before returning back to me.

“Ass! Tam not sensitive!” The nurses started working again until I felt the last of the wrap leave my face.

“Can you open your eyes?” Taking a deep breath, I opened my eyes. After focusing, I landed on Alec and smiled. “How bad do I look?” “Here is a mirror.” The nurse held it up for me to look. She was right, I did need a hair cut but overall, it wasn’t bad. It looked like I got burnt bad in the sun but otherwise pretty good. “There shouldn’t be any scaring on your face.” “you look beautiful as always.” Alec muttered.

«Let's see how bad my body is.” I said, nodding for her to continue. I was 99% sure I was going to be getting some

I tattoos.









###Chapter 0602

 I My youthful skin was now relaced with I scars, indentions and imperfections. As each layer of wrapping came off, new {horrors were being exposed. The pattern I of the chains was very clear with each link. Red, angry, and irritated skin was now my look.

“Everything is still inflamed. Once the swelling goes down, it won't be as red.” The nurse tried to ease my mind.

Looking up, Alec was staring at my body.

Colt had his head in his hands as he sat on the couch. “Okay.” Was all I could get out.

“The blisters are all scabbing over and should be completely healed this evening.

I'm going to send you home with some cold compresses but an ice bath wouldn't be a bad idea.” Looking up at Alec, I was scared to even ask. “Do we even have a home to go home

DENT ) His eyes instantly went up to mine before I softening. Alec opened his mouthrafew I times and closed it, giving me my answer.

I “You guys can come over to our place.” I" Colt offered as he stood up.


f “I appreciate the offer but the packhouse still has Alec’s old room we can stay in.” The nurse was down to my legs at this point.

“Do you need me to stay, sis?” Colt asked.

“No. I'm okay.” Tearing my eyes off my legs, I looked up at him.

“You're not okay.” “Well, no but I'm not going to fall apart either. You can go do what you need to do.” I gave him a small smile.

He raised his hand like he was going to touch me but decided against it. “Love you.”

I “Love you too.” I said quietly as he I turned to leave. After giving me one last look, he walked out of the room. “What i I did he need to go do?” I asked Alec.

“He is going to call Jasper and get an I update and figure out what Jace and Lars I are doing. We took over the pack so now we have to divide the land and the people init.” “Is this the first time there has been a war with no fighting and no one died?” Alec snorted at my comment. “Don’t know I would call it a war. Anthony ran like a fucking coward and abandoned his pack. Poor way to get a victory but I'l] take it.” “I’m all done here. I am going to leave you uncovered. I'll check back in a few hours to see how you are healing and to make sure there isn’t any infection.

Burns can be a bitch.” She smiled at me but did put a hosptial gown over my body so I was covered up at least. When mynoveldrama

"modest went away, I wasn’t sure but too I many people have seen me naked to care I at my burnt nudity at this moment. I A phone in Alec pocket rang. Using his distracted mind, I slowly got up to look at I my body in the mirror. The ribs weren’t I as sore as I figured they would be but my shoulders did hurt like a bitch. They will probably never be the same after this. My wrist was yellow and green but it felt better.


Taking my gown off, I just stared at myself. My hair was singed but I still somehow had my eyebrows and eyelashes. There wasn’t a single part of my body that wasn’t red, inflamed or puffy in some way.

Seeing a hair tie on the counter, I was able to get my hair into a somewhat messy bun, but it did little to improve my looks. “Everything will go back the way it was.” Alec said as he walked up behind I me.

“No itwon’t.” I traced the chain pattern ) across my chest and down my arms and "stomach. “The chains left in indention in I my skin. I won’t need to tattoo anything, I these will stand out.” I «your body is like a canvas. It shows all the pain you been through but you are still here. These are all superficial. It doesn’t matter to me what your skin looks like. It’s what is in your heart that matters.” Alec didn’t dare touch me to I didn’t get extra germs but his eyes drilled holes into me.

“I’m not the super model body sexy looking girl anymore.” ‘Honey, you were never the super model type.” Alec rolled his eyes. “You had muscle in places they don’t. You have curves they don’t and those breast....” Alec let out a whistle.

“On the bright side, I got a boob lift from the skin grafting.” I tried to smile through it but I knew I wasn’t fooling

"him. He could feel the sorrow and pain I I was feeling from looking at my skin.

However, he also knew I was feeling it i and not running away from it. - “You never needed a boob lift.” (Turning around, I was able to see the slats of the chair I was in. Where the wood was burning the fabric into my flesh. “Yeah...” “What are you most worried about?” Alec asked.

“Oliver said I may not have feeling in my body anymore.” I said quietly without looking at him. “What if I can’t feel you anymore?” “Love. There isn’t anything that will keep you from not feeling me.” I felt the desire run through him. He stepped forward and placed his hand on my lower back. One of the least affected areas. The sparks that ran through my body was just as intense.

There was some parts that were lighter

but it was still there. All the way to my toes.

I “It’s lighter in some areas but I can still I feelit.” \ I “Just imagine what it will feel like when ( youare healed.” “I need to heal quickly so we can go get our daughter.” I couldn’t top the one tear that fell down my face. The saltiness of it burning the raw flesh under it.

“We will. We will get her back and kill those bastards, ending this completely.” Alec’s eyes turned black as I felt a surge of power coming from him.










###Chapter 0603 

“Your skin is looking much better.” Alec whispered in my ear.

By the time we made it home, we both had passed out in bed. With his arms gently placed around me, I was able to sleep comfortably and safely. I had just started waking up when he started moving his hand down my arm and around my back. Where the scarring was the worst, I was only able to feel a light version of the sparks but they were still there.

“Am I healed?” Opening my eyes, I started looking at my skin. Everything looks days old. There wasn’t any open wounds and everything was either scabbed over or scarring. My tissue was still red and angry but not as puffy as it was.

“Enough that we can focus on where they are at and get her back.” Alec kissed my

head before I felt the bed shift from him ) getting out.

“I should be good to shower ther:*-twas ' talking more out loud to myself than to Alec but he still turned around and I nodded.

“Yeah, you should be good. I am going to call Colt and get moving.” As he walked out of the bedroom, I was left to get myself showered. My shoulders were sore but not as bad. The determination from both of our wolves really did me good. However, my wolf was completely spent. She was passed out. This was the first time that I have ever felt her energy be so low. It will probably take a few days to get back to where it needs to be, Alec’s too, I'm sure.

I'wanted to take a hot shower but figured the cooler water would be better as to not irritated the redness more. However, I would have to agree with Alec. My skin was looking much better. It was nice to be


able to shampoo my uneven hair and my ) body I Since it was cooler water, it was a short I shower. It was only when I started I brushing my hair that I realized how I uneven it was. There was some sadness I but my eyes landed on a pair of scissors and my brain turned off. Before I knew what I was doing, the scissors were evening out my hair. Chunks of hair fell in the sink.

“What ar-" Alec walked in to the bathroom but stopped when he realized what I was doing.

“It was uneven so I was trying to fix it.” By the time I was done, it was at my shoulders. Never in my life had I ever had it this short but it wasn’t terrible. It was by no means an even haircut but it was much better than it was.

“I think you got it pretty good. Here, let me get some in the back.” Alec took the scissors from me and did a few snips

I before setting them done. “Ready to get ) dressed?” “I am. Did you get ahold of Colt? What's the plan?” Walking to our closet, I put on I some loser joggers since my skin was still tender. noveldrama

I “I did. We are going to head over there while he makes a few calls. He did sent a scout down there and they should have arrived about an hour ago.” “I don’t like waiting and being this far away. Can’t we go down there and do our own scouting or just be there? I need to know we are close to her. Maybe when something comes in, we will be able to move quicker.” “I don’t disagree but I don’t want to accidentally be seen and scary them away. That could make it even harder to find them or impossible.” After pulling on a sweater, I pulled my hair in a braid. “Okay, let's go.” It wasn't

exactly defeat I was feeling but I just ) wanted my baby back in my arms i Alec followed me out of the closetand to the car. “Do you want breakfast?” “I’m not hungry.” 1 said as we got into {his truck. Our vehicles were starting to be limited.

“You can’t neglect yourself. Adalynn needs a healthy mother for when we get her back.” “Did you eat breakfast?” I pushed. Alec started the engine and pulled out of the garage.


“That’s different. I am a man.” “Full of shit is what you are.” Folding my arms, I was partially annoyed.

“Here.” Alec nudged me and handed me a chocolate muffin. There was a bottle of water in my cup holder. When that got there, I wasn’t sure.

I “Smooth.” I would have refused it but it } was chocolate so who was I to not eat breakfast. Still, wondering if Adalynn was I getting fed properly or just treated correctly left me to just nibble on the I muffin.

Alec didn’t answer me but focused on driving. The roads had been cleared for the most part but I was over the cold, snowy season. I wanted the sun.

By the time we made it to Alec’s pack, I had finished the top of my muffin. Alec seemed pleased with that and didn’t argue with me when I left the rest on the center consol.

“How are you feeling?” Colt got my attention as we went up the stairs.

“Like a million bucks.” I said, instantly remembering that I said that in the hospital but Alec didn’t relay that message correctly. I was going to say something but decided it wasn’t worth it.

“You do look better. Still a little funky ) and people can tell us apart now though.” Colt rested his arm around my shoulders I and guided me inside.

“They could always tell us apart.” Rolling I my eyes, I had to hold back from I flinching as he squeezed my shoulder.

“Shit! Sorry!” Colt must have seen the little bit my face moved.

“It’s okay. Still sore but it does look better.” Colt opened his office and let us in. Penny was at her desk, working away. She barely looked up before she went back to what she was doing. “Cold, I want to go to Florida and wait for any news. I can’t sit here and do nothing.” I said firmly. He wasn’t going to argue with me or I was prepared to pull the burning victim card.











### Chapter 0604 

“Okay.” Colt sat down in his chair-He I just shrugged and started working on his I computer.

/ Iwas so caught off guard that I wasn’t i sure what to say. I figured he would have argued that I needed to heal more or it’s too dangerous or something. Alec moved over to a chair and sat down, leaving me to stand by the door, looking lost.

“Okay?” 1 repeated as I moved to sit beside Alec.

“Yeah. That has been the plan since we found out they were going to the beach. It was more of making sure you lived as for timing.” Colt didn’t even look at me as he kept typing away.

“Done!” Penny slammed down her fist before she stood up.

(o\ it? v : “Got it?” Colt asked, looking up at hernoveldrama

\ and holding out his hand.

\ “I do. It took some... convincing but it’s y I done.” Penny looked a little devilish-but I who was I to comment on looks right now.

{Colt took the paper and looked it over before handing it out to Alec. “Thanks, hun.” Colt smiled at Penny.

“What is it?” Standing up, I walked over to look over Alec’s shoulder but he pulled me down into his lap instead.

“This is how we are going to get to Florida undetected. We will be taken to this location. There, we will hide out and wait for information on where Adalynn is being held.” Alec pointed at each address and traced his finger on the map.

“So when do we leave?” My eyes locked with Alec. “Tonight. We need to move in the dark.” I knew he was right but my heart didn’t

want to listen. “What am I suppose to do } all day?” “You are going to come with me.” Periy I sounded way too cheerful as she bounced over to me.

{My body reacted on it's own and leaned away from her. “Doing... what?” Penny rolled her eyes. “You can whip off that grimace off your face. We are going to slather you in cream. It is a herbal remedy for burns.” “I think I am looking pretty good...” Not that it didn’t sound like fun... I didn’t want to be away from the information as it came in.

“You look like a puffy tomato with bug bites.” Penny folded her arms over her chest.

“Damn, Penny.” I was both proud and I annoyed with her sarcastic remark.

“Come on. You can act like I hurt your

\ feelings as I cover your entire body with ) cream.” Penny nudged my arm and walked to the door. “Come on, tomato.” “I'll mind-link you if anything comes I up.” Alec promised. He slapped my thigh I before nudging me to get up.

\ “Did you know about this?” Alec didn’t even try to hide his guilt.

“Sure did. You wouldn’t have came if I told you. I love you so go get better.” Standing up with my arms folded over my arms, I just looked at him. “You realize she is going to touch every inch of my skin. Touch me in places that you haven't in days.” “Gross.” Colt fake vomited.

Alec frowned at me. “She is going to wear gloves. Don’t be so dramatic.” “Fine but when I like it, you have only yourself to blame.” Stomping away, I could hear Alec snort.


\ “That’s the spirit!” Penny smiled at me ) asl passed her.

I kept walking even after I heard the office door shut. “It won’t be so bad.” \ “Penny, would you want to leave if it was {your kids that were kidnapped?” “No but I wouldn’t have gotten out of bed. You are stronger than you think.” Penny led me to the hospital room in the packhouse. “In here?” “Yeah. Get naked and lay down on the table.” Penny walked over to the table. Putting on gloves, she looked at me and snapped them like you see in the movies.

“Really?” “Yes ma'am.” All I could do was stare at the stained ceiling tiles.

Penny started at my feet. The cream was cold on my skin, making me twitch every

I" time she put some on.

I “You do look better.” I “My wolf is asleep and probably will for another day or two.” “Well, it might take a couple days so let I your wolf sleep. I have a feeling you will need all her energy in the end.” Penny sounded like she knew something I didn’t.

“What do you know?” I didn’t have to look down at her since she was working on my stomach.

“Just that Colt said it would be you and him verse Anthony and Ann. I know Ann isn’t a fighter but I do need to ask something.” “What?” “When the time comes... help Colt kill Anthony.” “What do you mean?”

“I mean that Colt intends to challenge ) Anthony if it comes to it. He isn’t going to I let Anthony get away. \ I Don’t let Colt challenge Anthony. Just kill Ann and it will be two against one. You [can fight Anthony right?” “Colt intends to challenge Anthony?” I wasn’t shocked but yet... was. “Yeah.

Adalynn might be your child but she is his blood. You know better than anyone that you don’t mess with your blood. Colt is handling it personally.” “What about Alec?” “The plan is Alec will get Adalynn away.

If Anthony manages to have backup, which we don’t believe he will, but if he does than Alec will be the best option to keep her safe. Everyone knows that Ann is yours. Alec wanted to be the one to till Anthony but Adalynn won't go to Colt like she would Alec. Colt promised to kill Anthony by any means necessary.”

“Does Alec know he plans on challenging ) him?” By this time, I was completely covered in the front.

a I Sit up for me.” Listening to Penny, I sat up so she could get my back.

I “Well?” ) “No.. well, not to my knowledge.” Penny sighed. “Stand up.” Doing what she asked, I tried to not mess up any of the cream. “Colt doesn’t want to let Alec down and Alec is putting a lot of trust in Colt to handle it.”












###Chapter 0605 

“So, that’s the plan? Alec somehow I separate Adalynn from Ann and Anthony and run?” I { “Asfar as I’m aware.” I “At least she will be safe in anything happens to us.” “Colt wrote a Will. If he dies, Alec will take over the pack with my assistance.” “WHAT?” I turned to looked down at her.

She was working on my ass so I almost knocked her down.

“What?” “Colt wants Alec to take over the pack? What about you?” Penny pushed me back around. “Kristen, I'm not an Alpha. I can’t make those kind of decision. Besides, he will only be handling things unti] the boys are old

[enough to take over. I want to focus on ) my projects and raising the boys. Not the stress of running a pack. Of course, I'l still do day to day stuff but what do I know about training a warrior?” I It made sense. “Why do you mean boys?” “Well, Colt doesn’t want to tell the kids what order they were birthed into. He said that drove a wedge between you guys growing up and since we have two boys, he thinks it will be worse. He wants to train both boys to be alphas and see which one is better or just give it to both of them.” “What about Eliana?” “He said she can be part of it but I don’t want to raise her like that if she doesn’t want to. You were forced into it and I want her to have a choice.” Penny sighed like she was exhausted from this conversation. They must have had multiple conversations about this.

I “Everything will work out the way it is \ suppose to.” I told Penny that but it is I something I kept repeating to myself.

f Why this needed to happen, I wasn’t sure but the Moon Goddess must have a I reason.

I “I’m sure it will.” Penny put a little more cream on before she stood up. “All done.

Now you just need to stand there for an I hour or so and then we will rinse you I off.” I “Rinse me off... how?” My eyes went to the chemical shower head in the corner.

Nothing about this was good.

“Unless you want to walk to my shower, you are using that.” “Why didn’t we just do this in your room?” Dropping my arms, I just looked around for something to do... or to sit.


“In cases you reacted badly to this, I could rinse you off easily and there is epi in here.” Penny sat down after washingnoveldrama

I her hands and opened a bag of chips.

I) “I really hate you right now.” “The alternative is if you died, I'll take your anger.” Penny gave me a whatever shrugged and popped a chip into her i mouth.

“Who is all going with us?” “No one.” Penny looked me dead in the eye. “You will literally be on your own.

Once you get down there, all you have is Alec, Colt and the scout, whoever that is.” “We leave tonight?” Penny ate another chip and nodded.

“Yup. You will be on the plane tonight.” “Okay, so we are taking a plane.” “A small one and it will be dropping you off about an hour from where you are staying. You will get into a car and travel to that location where you will hide. Not once stepping out until you are told to do

I so by the scout. Can’t risk you being ) seen.” I “Have they found Anthony yet?” “As far as I’m aware... no.” Penny finally I gave me some sympathy. “Ann wanted to I take Adalynn away from you and raise her as her own. Don’t forget Vivian is with them... or should be. Vivian knows Adalynn and they will treat her right. If you find any comfort in that, believe Adalynn isn’t being abused.” Nodding a few times, I tried to make Penny’s words give me comfort. It did a little but until she was in my arms, there wasn’t any calming my heart.

We fell silent as I let my mind work. Alec was showing me more faith by allowing me to handle Ann and I guess Vivian on my own. Though, he might be taking out Vivian just so he could kill someone too.

After all the grief he gave me about being safe and not taking risk, he was literally allowing me to get into a fight. He knew I

I needed this and I wasn’t going to listen ) regardless so might as well give in.

There was enough question in that I thought process that made me know I was going to need to have that conversation with him. All I knew was...

even with Adalynn... Alec wouldn't be far from me. If push came to shove, he better chose her life over mine.

“Okay! It’s time to rinse you!” Penny stood up so quickly that I was caught off guard. My thoughts made me space out and the hour passed so quickly that I didn’t even realize it.

“Do I look any better?” Penny walked to the shower and turned it on. “We shall see.” “There is only one temperature... isn’t there?” “Yeah and unfortunately that is cold.” Penny motioned for me to go in.

I Fuck me... Okay, it was all or nothing.

) Taking a deep breath, I just jumped in.

I The razer sharp jets of water shooting out I was literal ice as it hit my body. “FUCK!” ! yelled. Jumping from foot to foot, I let I Penny get in there and whip it all off.

I “OKAY!” Penny shut the water off and immediately handed me a towel.

“Fuck..fuck...fuck...” “Are you okay?” Alec asked in the mind- link.

“No! I'm fucking not okay! Fucking cold ass shower!” He didn’t respond but I felt the amusement from him. “Damn, that worked great!” Penny grabbed my arm and twisted me.

Following her gaze, I looked down at my skin. Most of the inflammation had gone and the redness was a darker pink shade.

The scarring was almost complete but

I even that improved. “What was that ) shit?” I “No idea. Something the doc told me to I use.” Penny handed me my clothes.

I “Come on. Get dresses and let’s get you ' packed to leave.” I “About time.”










###Chapter 0606 

I “Don’t pack too much, just a small-to-go I bag.” Alec barely walked two feet into the I bedroom before he got snippy with me.

{ “Iam literally packing what Colt and f Penny laid out for me to pack. Why they didn’t just put it into the bag, I don’t know.” It was rather frustrating being question for doing what I was told to do.

Alec didn’t answer but grabbed my arm and turned me to look at him.

He took his time as he looked over my body and even pulled my shirt up to look at me. “I’m amazed at how well that worked.” “Me too. My wolf is still sleeping, is yours?” Alec let me go and picked up his own bag.

“Yeah. Should be awake tomorrow. They put all their energy into healing you before this.”

I Adding the last pair of pants, I zipped up my bag but Alec took it before I could pick I it up. “Thanks. Is supper ready?” I “It is, lets head down. Colt has a full meal I for us and then it will be time to leave.” {Since Alec’s hands were so massive, he carried both bags in one hand and held my hand in his other. My hands were one of the areas that I had a faint tingly feeling so I put my arm against his to feel the full tingly affect.

People were mingling around the pack like it was just an average day. At one point, a random door opened and I about jumped out of my skin. A flash back of Ann coming out and punching me in the face forced me to constantly be on edge here.

“Still?” Colt’s voice came up behind us.

My mouth opened a few times before I shut it and just shrugged. Thankfully, the guys didn’t press it and we just walked

I into the dinning room. The smell of ) steak, rice and peppers not only assaulted I my nose, but made my mouth water. I I didn’t even have to get a plate. There was one already on the table where Penny was I sitting. My steak was much smaller than I Coltand Alec’s but I didn’t mind.

“There you are!” Penny smiled before taking a bit. “Sorry I didn’t wait for you.” “I think you seen enough of me today.

You didn’t need to wait.” “You are really a lucky man, Alec.” Penny smirked at Alec.

Both Alec and I shared a very confused look. “What is going on with you? This isn’t the Penny I know.” Alec helped me cut my steak without even asking. I assumed he thought my hands wouldn't be able to hold the knife and fork. “Nothing is wrong.” “Yeah, okay and I'm not covered in burns

I from head to my toes.” The sarcasm was \ thick but she didn’t respond. Instead, I Colt changed the subject.

( I “My money is on her being pregnant.” I Alec said in the mind-link.

{ “Oooh, I didn’t even think of that.” My ' eyes went over to her face. Really studying her features and how she seemed to be a little more glowing.

However, there was some bags under her eyes.

After a few bites, I was done eating.

Setting my fork down, I couldn’t help but watch as the kids ran around the room and their mother’s or father’s chasing them around to keep them contained.

There was both happiness and sadness.

“Earth to Kristen!” Colt snapped his fingers in front of my face.

Swatting at his hands, I gave him a disapproving look. “What do you want?”

I “Time to go.” “perfect!” 1 was up before I pushed away I from the table, making it lift up a little.

“Shit, sorry!” Colt and Alec tried to grab the drinks but I itwas too late, the water ran down the table. “It’s okay. I'll clean it up, you guys get going.” Penny gave Colt a quick kiss f as the staff came over with rags.

“Love you.” I heard Colt say as I practically ran out of the room.

I didn’t hear what Penny or anyone else said for that matter. My only focus was to get on the plane.

“Kristen, hold up.” Alec grabbed my arm and pulled me to a stop.

“Why? We need to get on the plane.” “T know but I can fell your anxiety. You need to come down.” “How am I suppose to do that?” Folding

I my arms over my chest, Colt walked into ! the lobby.

I “Everything good?” Colt looked between § US.

I I “Fine.” Rolling my eyes, I walked out of I the packhouse and down the stairs. Since I didn’t hear Alec and Colt whispering, I assumed Alec just shook his head. Right f as I got up to the car, the lights blinked, letting me know that it was unlocked.

“It is an hour drive to the plane and then we will be in the air for three maybe four hours.” Colt said after he slid into his seat. Alec took the passenger seat.

“There will be a pillow and blanket on the plane for you if you want to sleep.” Colt looked at me in the rear view mirror as he pulled out.

“I don’t think I will be sleeping anytime soon.” “You need to be rested. We could need to

I move at any moment and if you are } sluggish... you will be useless.” Colt’s voice got more annoying the more he I used logic against me.

\ “It’s not that I don’t want to sleep, I don’t think I can.” “Here you go.” Alec lifted his arm back for me to take something out of his hand. I There was three red gummies staring up at me.

“What are those?” “Melatonin.” “You want to drug me?” “It is quick acting and doesn’t linger. You will be fine.” Alec dropped them in my lap since I didn’t take them right away. noveldrama

“Are you taking them?” I asked, looking at them like they were evil.

“Sure am. Go on, take them.”

I «If this is a trick, I will kill you.” Eyeing \ both of them, I put them in my mouth and chewed before swallowing.












###Chapter 0607

 By the time I focused on anything, we I were still in a car driving. However, this I was a leather seat. “Have we not got to the plane yet?” I “Ice, we are in Florida.” My jaw dropped as I looked around. It was completely black so it wasn’t like I could see anything to distinguish where we were. Sitting up, my head was still groggy and tired. “I’m still tired.” “J figured. Go back to sleep and rest.” Alec looked back at me and smiled.

“You planned this.” Betrayal spread through me but he just felt humor at my expense.

“Just sleep, love.” Alec said in the mind- link.

“Kiss my ass.” I tried to fight itbut I couldn’t. My eyes closed and darkness

, took over again.

By the time I was able to fully open then, my wolf was doing a dance in my head.

She apparently got her energy back and } was ready to go. The smell of salt water and what I assumed was seagulls making I a huge racket.

“Morning.” Alec walked into the room with a towel around his waist.

“Any updates?” I asked instantly as I jumped out of bed.

“No. They haven’t been located. Colt has breakfast in the kitchen for you. Don’t look out the windows or anything.” “Obviously.” Annoyed already, I got out of bed and made my way to the kitchen.

“There is sleeping beauty.” Colt teased.

“I’m never taking those gummies again.” “You needed to sleep. Alec said you tossed and turned all night the other

, night and sleep will let you and your wolf } heal.” Colt put a plate in front of me and I piled on the eggs and sausage.

f “I’m not that hungry.” \ I “You've lost weight. You need to eat more.” Colt frowned as he drank his coffee.

“I'll eat when I get my daughter back.” After a few bites, Alec came out of the bedroom.

“Smells good.” “Here, then finish it.” Shoving the plate in front of him, I got up and just started pacing. “So what? We just look at these walls until we get a phone call? It’s been days already with nothing. It could be more days.” “I' know it’s hard but we will get through this,” Colt sighed.

“We don’t even know if we are in the right place.” I continued,

I “yes we do.” Alec said between bites.

My head whipped over to his. “Excuse 4 I me?” “There was surveillance evidence of them I eating together. Some with Adalynn and (some without. They are here, we just need to find out where.” He didn’t even look at me as he spoke. “When were you going to tell me that?” I screamed. Anger ran through my veins.

Alec kept sending over calming emotions but I would push them out. “We just got it a few hours ago.” Colt rolled his eyes at me and pointed to the fax machine.

Walking over, my hands shook as I picked up the pieces of paper with pictures printed on them. There was my baby girl.

A few different picture of her eating and one of her even smiling.

“She’s alive and is okay. Can you please eat something now?” Alec asked. “You have to still take care of yourself.”

“After I eat, I want to fight.” “No.” Colt shook his head. 4 I My jaw fell again. “WHAT? Why?” “First off, this isn’t our house to mess up.

Second, you can spare and do different techniques but no actual fighting.” «Third, I have a stick up my ass and can’t see my sister needs to get some aggression out.” «gave it for Ann.” Colt went over to the coffee pot and filled up his glass.

After a few more bites, I was done eating.

Sitting down on the couch, I tired to find a good show to watch but it was futile.

The guys were talking back and forth about mundane things, the fax machine was showing a green light and I couldn't focus.

They knew the name of the restaurants. It seems they bounced around more than anything but Colt and Alec were trying to

I pin point it down. There was a massive I map on the dinning room table. The restaurants had no pattern to them. Some i I weren't even close to the others.

Everything just seemed random. Most I people would pick restaurants within I walking distance from their location if I they were hiding out. Even with my IQ, I couldn’t see a pattern. For all knew, they put every single restaurant ina hat and picked one. That is just when they go eat in a restaurant that even has cameras.

How many hole in the wall dinners have they been too. Those didn’t have cameras or at least any that I knew of. They could have a picnic on the beach.

“Hey! What about grocery stores?” Alec and Colt looked over at me. “What?” “J was just thinking. They probably aren’t eating out every meal and even if they were, they still need toilet paper and house hold supplies. They have to get that from somewhere.”

I «That's a great idea...” Colt pointed his I finger at me and shook it as his mind I went to his phone. “These are grocery i I stores, convenience stores and basically I anywhere else they could stop to grab I those items.” I “Kristen, do you see any kind of pattern now?” Alec asked as Colt kept putting blue dots along the streets.

“you can add bars as another color.

Anthony drank like a race horse.” “Good call.” Colt grabbed an orange marker and did the same. noveldrama

“This is a populated area. My guess is he wants to be in the middle of things if he is going to those kinds of restaurants. He would be too vain to be in a condo so look for beach houses...” Colt’s head snapped up and looked at me as I said that.

“Mom’s beach house.” “Mom didn’t have beach house?” Not

I that I remembered anyway.

\ “shit, I don’t remember if she owned itor { I just stayed there. I forgot what dad told I me but I swear there was a place they would stay when they came here.”










###Chapter 0608 

“There wasn’t anything in the Will-about an address. Just that they would come I visit here.” I “Carson.” Colt snapped his fingers. “I bet dad told Carson about it.” I was skeptical but we didn’t have anything to lose. Colt was already on the phone, looking up at his contacts before I even had a chance to offer my opinion.

“Hey, I need a minute of your time, do you have a second?” Colt placed the phone on speaker phone and set it down. “Of course. How is things working out with Anthony?” “I have you on speaker phone with Alec and Kristen. We took over his pack but he kidnapped Kristen and Adalynn. He left her in a burning out and took Adalynn to Florida. We are here, trying to find them but we aren’t have any luck. Do you

remember when dad and mom would come down here? Do you remember where they would stay?” I There was a long pregnant pause on the other end. I was almost ready to speak up ! to make sure the connection didn’t drop before he started talking. “Well, shit.

Why didn’t you call me?” “It all happened so quickly.” Colt sounded more tired than anything.

“Well, that was a live time ago. Let me think.” Carson blew out some air. “You said Kristen was okay?” Colt looked up at me. “Yeah, I made it out alive.” I didn’t elaborate and he didn’t ask.

“I don’t remember exactly where but I do remember your dad telling me there was this alcoholic ice pop truck parked directly in front of it. His house was literally on the sand and this truck would be parked there. It drove your dad nuts

, because there would always be a huge crowd. They could never go swimming in peace.” “I can’t g****e that. We would need to walk up and down the shore to find one.” “I'm sorry I can’t be more help. I really wish I knew but I will keep thinking. Do you need warriors or anything?” Colt shook his head like Carson could see him. “We don’t. Jace and Lars might. You could call them and see how they are doing. Tjust left them to deal with the mess.” “Alright. I'll call them.” “Thanks.” Colt said and picked his phone up. He pressed end as I looked back at the nap.

“Those trucks will be stations are more popular areas but again, that was twenty years ago.” My fingers tapped away on the map as I thought. We could g****enoveldrama

, what was popular then but it wouldn’t give up specific areas. “We need to go to a bar and ask an older bartender what they : I remember or just find a truck and ask them.” I “We can’t but I can have someone do I that.” Colt took his phone and started I texting a book. “Done.” “Great. Now we sit and wait.” There I wasn’t any looking outside or even sitting I on the beach. I think it might have been better if I was able to go for a walk or something. “I’m not made for surveillance.” “The alternative is letting you go out and if Ann or Anthony get a glimpse of you, they will leave and we will never see Adalynn again. The risk isn’t worth it.” Colt didn’t even look at me as he messed around on his phone.

“Come play with me.” Alec said from the livingroom.

Turning around, I saw him shuffling a deck of cards. “You want to play a game?” “I'm sorry, I was under the impression I you didn’t like staring at the walls.” Alec gave me a look. “You in, Colt?” “Yeah, I'll play.” Colt didn’t look up as he kept typing and walked to the livingroom.

“Well, shit. Fine.” Giving in, I jus walked over and sat down on the floor. The coffee table was a massive square, making it perfect for cards. “What are we playing?” “Well, we aren’t playing strip poker.” Colt put his phone down and glared at me.

“I’ve never played strip poker!” I was appalled by his accusation. My eyes glanced over at Alec and he seemed amused.

“That’s not what Emmy told me.” “Emmy is a fucking liar!” I yelled at Colt.

Looking at Alec, I tried to plead to him.

“Itisn’t true! I never did that!” “Why are you so defensive? Seems like you are over denying.” Alec was trying to hid a smile.

\ I “You both suck.” Realizing what they I were doing. “Just deal me. What are we playing?” “Just regular Mississippi Stub.” Alec started dealing out cards to us.

After each of us had two cards, he put the deck to the side. Taking a look, I had a set of 9s. “I guess we don’t have anything to bet.” Colt said looking around.

“I think I saw a couple cartons of cigarettes in the bathroom.” Alec muttered.

“That would work.” Colt said and got up to go get them.

“I didn’t think you would have it in you to play strip poker.” Alec whispered.

My eyes met his and narrowed. “Are you telling me you have played strip poker?” “Inever said that.” Alec whispered-as Colt came back into the room with three cartons of cigarettes.

“We each can have a pack.” Tossing me one, I pulled one out.

“One to play and then go up from there.” “Sounds good to me.” Alec lifted his lip at me. I had to look away. That face always made my panty’s wet and I couldn’t do that in front of Colt. Alec knew that too, fucking asshole.

We each put one in the middle of the table before Colt raised it by one. Alec folded and I matched him. “Okay.” Alec said before flipping one card over. It was a four of hearts.

Colt raised another cigarette. Not wanting to be out done, I mated him. Alec nodded and flipped another one. I got

, another nine. Colt put another one in and I I added two instead of one.

I “Lady raised you, do you match or-fold?” Alec said in his dealer voice.

Colt studied me before adding another one. Alec flipped the last card over and it was a ten. Colt put two more cigarettes in and I matched him.

“Alright, flip them over.” Alec said.

Colt went first and he had a set of fours in his hand. “Beat that!” “Okay.” I said, simply and showed him my nines before grabbing the pile and pulling them over to me.









###Chapter 0609 

It’s been three fucking long ass fucking days! By this time, Colt and Alec had to go back in for more packs of cigarettes but at I this point, I had the entire box in my I possession.

“JACKPOT!” Colt yelled. I was being forced to eat more eggs when Colt yelled.

It startled me so much that the eggs went flying.

“The hell, Colt?” “He found them.” Colt held out his phone for me to see a new message that just came through. Adalynn and Ann were sitting with Anthony on a balcony restaurant. Ann was feeding Adalynn some bacon with a smile on her face and Anthony was reading the paper.

My emotions for caught in my throat as tears filled my eyes. Taking Colt’s phone, I had to enlarge the picture of Adalynn.

She looked happy and healthy. No bruises or scratched were on her face.

“Where are they?” Alec asked, interrupting my self spiral. He put his hand on my lower back and tilted the J phone so he could see her.

I “That picture was taken just a few minutes ago. Currently, they are at a restaurant call... what does my phone say?” Colt asked.

Not wanting to give him back his phone, I scrolled up. “Brille’s Cafe.” “He is going to follow them back to their house so we will know where they are staying. We need to be ready to go tonight to get Adalynn back.” Colt ripped his phone out of my hands as I jumped up from my chair in excitement.

“Fuck yeah! About time!” Turning, I made a bee line straight to my bedroom but stopped half way and froze

I There was no reason to change now Maybe I should lay my clothes out? Why would I do that? I only have one style of clothes. Bathroom, I should go to the bathroom.

I Taking a few steps there, I stop/ped again. I just went before I sat down to eat my eggs. Eggs! Maybe I should eat to get my strength up! Turning back around, I took three steps towards my eggs but they were all on the ground. Nope, not eating. Maybe I shou...

“Kristen!” Colt yelled, snapping me out of my thoughts.


“What?” “Come sit down. We have hours before we are going to get to leave.” Alec walked over to me and put his hands on my shoulders from behind. Pushing me, gently, he guided me to the couch.

“Relax. We need you to be focused. I can’t let you go half cocked to kill Ann. If you can’t gather yourself, you are staying

here.” Alec knelt down in front of me. “The hell { if you will!” I yelled.

“Then get it together.” This tone was so calm and quiet. Why did he have to be the . level headed one.

“Was there any sign of Vivian?” I asked quietly.

“Not yet.” Colt said as he sat down beside me. “Here, you can watch my phone for updates as they come in.” Colt laid his phone down on the coffee table and turned the phone on high. Alec got up and went back to the kitchen as I stared at the phone. Colt grabbed the remote and turned the T.V. noveldrama

“How are you so relaxed right now?” I asked him.

“You are crazy enough for the both of us.

We can’t all fall apart, someone has to stay strong.” Colt pulled me back against

the couch “Yeah, well, you guys did this to me. I 4 was perfectly happy ignoring my emotions.” Alec sat down beside me. “Eat.” Pushing I a chocolate muffin in my hands.

Colt settled on the show Friends. It was the episode that Ross was playing the bagpipes for Monica.

Normally, I would have laughed but not so much today. “You hate this show.” “But you like you.” Colt ignored me and kept watching.

“I don’t need a babysitter.” Grumpily, I took a bite of muffin.

“You are literally throwing a fit because I am making you sit down and eat. I even gave you a show to keep you entertained.

How is that not acting like a child that needs a babysitter?” Colt looked at me like I was stupid

“Again, your fault for making me have emotions. I had to start somewhere and so does kids.” Rolling my ‘eyes, I just looked away from him and rested my head against the back of the couch.

After about an hour, the phone started I ringing. “What's happening?” My feet kicked as I tired to sit up.

“Give me a chance to look.” Colt sighed.

“Looks like they are on the move. This pictures is of them shopping.” “She looks happy.” I almost wished she was throwing a temper tantrum just to make their lives hell but I didn’t want Ann to hit her the way she did me.

“She looks cared for.” Alec correct. “No one is truly happy in their presence.” After another thirty minutes with no update, I sat back and tried to get back into watching Friends. Every single commercial, I kept looking down at the phone, hoping it would start lighting up

but nope, just a black screen My head rested against Alec’s shoulder 4 after another hour of nothing. My eyes started to fall. Even with trying hard to I stay awake, I couldn’t do it. However, just as I got comfortable, the phone starting I going off again. A huge wave of adrenaline surged through me but Colt beat me to the phone.

“They are at the beach.” He showed the the picture.

“That’s the house.” I said as another pictures came through.

“There is the truck, just like Carson said.” Alec pointed out from the corner of the picture.

“ - mm le rra- »n Damn. That’s crazy.

“TI am going to make supper. You stay here and relax. You were just about asleep. Hold my phone but relax. We still have hours before we can leave.” Colt

I pushed me back against Alec like he was tucking me in.

Just as he was about to walk away; Thad something to say. “No blanket?” I I Colt looked at me and I stuck my lip out.

All he did was flip me the bird and walked "away. “Just try to sleep.” Alec shook his head at me.

“We get to hold our baby girl tonight.” I whispered as I starred at the picture.











###Chapter 0610 

I Pants? Check. Shirt? Check. Hair pulled I back? Check. Underwear? Check.

I My hands ran over my body to make sure Twas fully dressed. “What are you doing?” Alec scared the crap out of me when he walked into the bedroom. My back was turned and I was silently panicking.

“Making sure I had everything.” He didn’t need to know I had a mild freakout that I forgot my bra.

“Yeah, okay. Ready to go?” “Yeeesss.” Giving my room one last look, I nodded at Alec.

Alec held out his arm for me to slip under it. “Don’t forget to collect yourself and do what needs to be done.” Alec stopped me and looked around for Colt before getting eye level with me. “If you need to shut off

your feelings in order to get our daughter back and not die, do it. I mean it, I can’t have you dying on me. If it comes to it, you need to make decisions with your head and not your heart. Kill Ann and I then get out. Colt will handle Anthony.

I Get Adalynn from me and I'll go back to help Colt. Kill Ann and make it to our meeting place. Do you understand?” Alec didn’t know of my conversation with Penny and honestly, I wasn’t going to leave my brother if he was losing. That was a promise I couldn’t give but this was exactly the situation that Alec wanted me to avoid. Get myself to safety and he would handle it. There was a sinking feeling that I was going to find myself in that situation and the only question is what my choice will be.

“I understand.” It wasn’t a promise and I did understand what he wanted me to do.

Alec searched my eyes for a moment longer before satisfied with my answer.

EE it ho Td “You guys ready? We need to leave.” Colt walked up behind Alec.


I “We are. Is the car here?” I asked;- stepping around Alec. I felt bad for not fully telling me what my plans could be I but he would stop me and that couldn’t I happen. It almost felt like I was keeping it from him.

“It is.” Colt nodded and walked in front of me out of the house. Cool salt water air hit me in the face for the first time since we came down here. Even in Florida, it was still chilly.

Alec and Colt got in the front and I slipped in the back. “Remember, when we get there, you are to take the front and I'll take the back.” Colt said as he pulled out.

“Maximum shock factor.” That was my idea. I wanted to kick in the front door and show them I was alive and ready to kill them. We didn’t want to lure them out in case they did something to

I Adalynn.

“That’s right. I'll be at the back door to stop them from running out the baek.” Colt said.

\ I “Are you sure you don’t want to take the i front?” Alec looked at Colt. This was really the only thing we argued about.

Alec felt like Colt and I should take the front door because it was our fight but Colt disagreed. Since they wronged Alec more, it should be him. In the end, Alec relented and he was taking the front.

“I’m sure. You need to get Adalynn and get out. Kill Vivian if needed.” “There hasn’t been any proof she is even here.” I reminded them. “Though, itis very possible. We didn’t have enough men to really scout the whole area.

“We will do what we do best. Work together as a team and follow the plan.

Don’t deter from the plan.” Colt looked in the rear view mirror at me. A shot of guilt

shot through me. noveldrama

Alec narrowed his eyes at me. “Of course.

Stick to the plan.” I repeated.

We fell into a silence since we were I pulling up to our drop off point. The ' house in question was down the beach, making is easy to sneak up to it. Still, it wasn’t extremely close so if a fight broke out on the beach, we would be spotted and the police would be called. Keeping the fight in the house was the only way to truly get Adalynn and get out. We didn’t have connections in Florida.

“Radio silent.” Colt muttered as they slipped out of the car, quietly. Their entire demeanors changed before they even shut the doors. However, my body froze. Alec's words echoed in my mind and I knew what I needed to do. Closing my eyes, I pushed everything a deep inside as I possible could. I couldn’t trust my heart to not make mistakes when my head is arguing. For Adalynn’s safety, I

needed to do this and do it correctly My door opened as my eyes opened, however, Sierra had forced her way forward. She was going to make sure we I got our daughter back. The glow of my I eyes illuminated Colt’s confusion before I acceptance.

Finally, he stepped back and allowed me to get out. The sun was officially retired for the night, making it perfect for us.

Less people will be around to witness what is about to happen.

Slowly, we made our way. My adrenalin pumped through my veins, making me aware just how close to Adalynn I was getting. Even though I made excellent progress on my emotions and I currently had them pushed down, anger managed to work it’s way up. Filling every inch of my body until I started vibrating in it.

There it was. The house that my parents came to. The house Adalynn is being held.

Blue faded paint was chipping around the

edges. The shrubs needed a good trim but it looked like the roof was fairly knew. A shadow passed over the closed window, making my eyes dart to it. Anthony. They were home and ready to get the surprise of their life.

I “This is it.” I said Alec in the mind-link.

“Let’s get our daughter back.”











###Chapter 0611

Colt walked around to the back and Alec and I got in the front. We gave him a minute to make sure he was in position before I went to kick down the door. However, I could hear them inside and it caused me to freeze.

"...got it! Damn!" The door handle jiggled before it swung over. Ann's eyes were looking at the ground but her movements halted when she saw our feet. Slowly, her eyes went up our bodies until she made eye contact with us. The trash bag she was carrying, dropped on the floor as the same time her mouth opened.

Not wanting her to scream, I reached out and wrapped my hand around her throat before she had the chance. Waving my finger in front of her face, I shook my head." Shhh, let's not do that." I whispered.

Alec moved the trash as I backed her up into the house. "What is going on, Ann? I told you to take the fuc-" Anthony came around the corner as Alec shut the door." You're alive."

"I am. Turns out you are really bad at killing someone." My hand squeezed around Ann's throat, making choking noises come out. Alec looked around the livingroom before walking down the hallway.

Anthony's eyes got wide and smiled as he heard a door open. He took a step towards me, like he was stalking his prey, "I wouldn't do that."

Colt's voice was deadly. Anthony instantly stopped at the same time I felt completely happiness from Alec. Anthony turned to look at Colt in time to see Colt flip the light switch off, making the livingroom and kitchen go dark. Thanks to our wolf night vision, we could still see perfectly fine.

Alec walked out with Adalynn sleeping on his shoulder. My heart ached but Ann started squirming in my hand. Instead, Alec made eye contact with me and walked out of the house. Closing the door quietly behind him.

"So, what? You are going to kill us?" Anthony seemed rather amused by this. He walked over to the bar and started to poor himself a drink.noveldrama

Walking Ann over to one of the kitchen chairs, her trembling body sat down instantly. As soon as my hand left her throat, she started coughing. Sucking in air into her lungs. There was a pairing knife sitting on the table that I grabbed before walking in front of her.

"H-how did you live?" She asked as I heard the first fist to face hit. Glass shattered as someone fell into the cabinet.

"I have eyes everywhere." Moving from the top to the bottom, the knife sliced her shirt so I could see her skin. A single red line of blood appeared as Ann flinched away from me "Either hold still or I will tie you up." I threatened as the knife started carving into her skin.

Part of me wanted to make this slow but I didn't want to drag this out more than I could. We could still be seen and that would end to my revenge. There was so much wresting that I turned to look. Colt picked up Anthony and tossed him against the end table, making the lamp fall to the floor and shatter into millions of pieces.


SLAP! There was a sting across my face where Ann got brave enough to try to fight back. Blood filled my mouth but it was only anger in my eyes. "Really? My wolf asked. Standing up, Sierra just dropped the knife on Ann lap. "You want a fighting chance before I gut you?"

Ann looked at the knife before looking back up at us. "I will just leave and you will never hear from me again!" She kept glancing over at Anthony and then back at me.

Sierra extended her claws before getting on eye level with her. "That won't be happening. I'm not leaving here until I take a bite out of your heart."

"FUCKING DAMMIT!" I heard Anthony yelled. Ann and I looked over as the boys rolled out the front door and down the steps,

"Dammit is right." Looking back at Ann, I was a little sad. "Unfortunately, I have to go do damage control." Sierra took her hand and shoved it deeply into her chest. Her heart beat in my hands quickly before I ripped it out. Ann got the pleasure of looking at her own blacken heart before her eyes rolled in the back of her head.

After waiting a second, her body fell on the floor but I heard growling outside. Dropping her heart, I ran to the bedrooms to make sure Vivian wasn't around. Opening the first door, it was a bedroom. I was just about to leave when I saw a foot sticking out from under the bed. It was the bottom of the foot so it was exhilarating to grab the ankle and rip them out from under the bed.

"Please! I was just doing what I was forced to do!" Vivin pleaded. Her hands were in front of her face in fear. The smell of it was seeping out of every single pore she had.

"I don't care." I said honestly before shoving my hand into her chest. This time, I just pulled her heart out and dropped it so I could make it outside quicker.

By the time I got there, they were wrestling in the sand. A neighbor opened his door to look out. "I'm sorry! They are drunk. I already called the police to them removed from the property!" I yelled out.

"Good! I don't need that shit here!" He yelled before slamming his front door shut. The plan was to move any fighting to a secluded place that was just down the beach. Getting Anthony there was another thing.

Going down the stairs, realization slammed into me like a ton of bricks. Colt was on the bottom as he pushed Anthony's hands away from his neck. Alec wanted to go to the meeting point but Colt didn't have time. Anthony's claws had extended and were getting closer and closer to his neck.











###Chapter 0612

"Don't do it!" Alec growled in my ear.

"He's going to die! Anthony is on top and his claws are inches above his neck. Penny said he would challenge him if needed!" My voice didn't sound like me as I pleaded for him to understand.

"I'm coming back. I'll give Adalynn to you and help Colt. Don't get involved!" Alec screamed.

I didn't have a choice. There was a little red line that traveled down Colt's neck as they fought for dominance. "I'm sorry, I have to!"

I didn't cut the mind-link but I didn't listen to whatever Alec said. Instead, I ran full speed at Anthony. The goal wasn't to engage but to buy Alec time. They were so focused on eachother. As soon as I was close enough, I dropped my shoulder and rammed into his rib cage. Three sickening snaps vibrated my shoulder from his rips as we rolled end over end of each other.

Since I had expected the outcome, I was the first to get up. Anthony's eyes followed me as I ran to the section of the bank that was more secured and away from the neighbors. "Alec! Meet us in the secure place and quick!" I yelled.

I didn't look back. Anthony's footsteps were right behind me. I couldn't hear Colt though. The closer Anthony got, the more I relied on my agility. Dodging to the left when he went to swipe at me but it slowed me down.

"Come to the left!" Alec yelled in my mind.

Not even questioning him, I tumed enough that my foot slipped. It was easier to catch myself but Anthony completely lost his balance and tumbled. "ALEC!" | screamed as I saw him step through the brush. Adalynn was awake and watching everything unfold.

"Here!" He practically tossed Adalynn in my arms as he went off to keep Anthony from getting to me. "Get to the safe room." He said in the mind-link.

I wasn't going to argue but as I turned to leave, Colt wasn't there. Scanning the area, Penny's voice echoed in my head. Where was my brother?

Moving as quickly as I could with Adalynn, we made our way back to where I last saw Colt. He was still on the ground, not moving.

"COLT!" I yelled before running up to him.

His eyes found mine but mine were stuck on the red slash across his neck. He opened his mouth to speak but I silenced him with a look. Setting Adalynn down, my wolf immediately pushed me back. I was so shocked that I couldn't even fight her.

Colt's eyes flashed and I realized his wolf came forward as well.

They locked eyes and it was as if they reached to out to eachother. I knew we were twins and our wolves were ancient but it never dawned on me how close our wolves really were. It wasn't like they were individuals, it was as if they were two parts that connected as one. The wolf spirit grew as they blended and focused their healing powers on Colt's throat. It only took a few seconds but Colt's cut meshed together before sealing itself. Once they were satisfied it was healed, they bowed their heads to separate.

It was physically painful but the power was so great that when they separated it was a relief. They were too large for one person to handle so they split themselves. The connection everyone called weird, the telepathy we had and even the verbal communication finally made sense to me. We weren't just normal twins. We were literally two part of the same soul.

"Is he dead?" Colt asked as he jumped up, almost knocking me over in the process. "No, go help Alec!" I yelled at him. He glanced at Adalynn before taking off down the beach.noveldrama

"Come on, baby," I whispered as picked up my daughter. Taking a moment to relish in the comfort she provided me. Adalynn laid her head on my shoulder.

As happy as I was that she was back in my arms, but I needed to know how the most important men in my life were doing. Wanting to stay hidden, I stayed right on the edge of the brush. Slowly creeping my way until their grunts were loud enough to tell me they were near.

Right as I got into view, relief flooded me as I saw Alec land a perfectly placed punch to Anthony's kidneys. He fell over in pain, hunched in a ball. At this point, they were getting their anger and frustration out on him before they took him out.

"Stop playing with your food." I told Alec in the mind-link.

He looked around until he made eye contact with me. "I thought you were going to the safe spot."

"I needed to make sure you were okay. I needed to see him die."

Alec didn't answer but stopped Colt from continuing kicking him. Grabbing Anthony by the hair, he turned him around so I could see his face... or what was left. Nothing was recognizable. I knew Alec looked at me before completely snapping his neck in one swift movement.

It was over. It was finally and completely over. Adalynn was safe and everyone that has ever hurt us was dead. Unless anyone else betrayed us, we were safe.

So many emotions tried to break free. Happiness and relief were the largest but all the pain that I have endured was seeping out of my eyes in the form of tears.

Holding Adalynn as tightly as I could, I almost fell but a pair of arms wrapped around me, keeping me from falling.

"Come on." Alec whispered and helped me walk back towards the house. The neighbor's lights were off, making it easier for Colt to carry Anthony's body back up the steps. Alec and I stayed in the shadows, waiting.

It didn't take long for flames to be visible and Colt run out of the house. We didn't stick around and wait. The four of us headed to the car. Alec sat in the back with Adalynn and I as we drove to the plane.















###﻿Chapter 0613

It's been a few months since a few months since Anthony and Ann died. Adalynn didn't even seem fazed by the whole thing. She slept just fine but then again, Alec kept her between us in bed. She has yet to sleep in her own crib. Our house and cabin have all been fixed. Alec made a few upgrades but this last week has been the first time it has been calm with true normalcy in our lives. No construction workers or anxious warriors checking on us. We haven't hired a nanny yet and probably won't.

Currently, I was standing in a tent by myself. The weather was getting warm and Alec was forcing me to have a luna ceremony. I wasn't even part of the planning. Penny took care of it all since Colt told her I saved his life. I tried to tell her that I was the one that actually put his life in danger but she wasn't listening. Even Colt didn't blame me. When I barreled into Anthony, his claw went across Colt's neck unintentionally. Which is probably why he left Colt and came after me. None of which Penny listened to.

Emmy had curled my hair and pinned half if it back. The makeup was light per my request but she still put a winged eyeliner on me. Penny picked out my dress. It was ivory dress. Silk long sleeves stopped just barely over my shoulder and went into a deep V. The natural waist dropped into a sheer fabric with flowers stitched into it.

The scars have relaxed and really created a pretty chain-link pattern. Although our wolves really worked on healing me, they are just now calming down and looking like regular scars. I have grown accustom to them to the point that I want to get them tattooed. As a symbol of my strength and determination to not let evil win.

Soft music was playing as I paced around this tent. The only thing I knew about this event was the smell of lilacs. "Ready?" Colt lifted the side and stepped in.

"This was completely unnecessary." Frowning at him, he just smirked at me.noveldrama

"This isn't the only surprise of the night." Colt had one hand in his pocket and the other was carrying a present.


"Oh?" My eyes went to the evil present in his hands. "I have everything I need."

Colt took a step forward and held out the bag. "Just open it."

Taking it, I sat down in the only chair in the tent. "Fine. Taking the tissue paper out, there was a picture frame in it. I expected to see a picture of Alec and me but instead, it was a young picture of our parents. The women looked so much like me but yet didn't.

"You have too much of dad in you but we are still clearly her children." Colt walked up beside me.

They were standing on the beach, in front of their beach house. Mom was smiling from ear to ear as she held her small baby bump. "Where did you find this?"

"Carson, actually. Went he was going through pictures for us. He found this after we got Adalynn back so he framed it for you." Colt put his hand on my back and handed me a tissue. Kneeling down, he got eye level with me. "I figured you wouldn't want to open this in front of everyone."

"You would be right." Shoving those pesky weeping feelings down, I was ready to accept a hug from Colt.

"Thank you."

"I wouldn't thank me yet." Colt said and stood up. "You haven't seen what this place looks like. She kept it simple but yet not at the same time. Not sure if it was a party for you or for her."


"I figured but I appreciate the unnecessary gesture the same." Smiling, I put the picture back in the bag.

"I'll put this in a safe place for you." Colt took it back. He looked out of the tent before handing it off and coming back inside. "It's time for us to start."

"Sounds good." Walking the few steps towards him, he held out his arm for me. "Nervous?"

"HA!" Shaking my head, I actually found that amusing. "After all the different ways I avoided death and you think this makes me nervous?"

"Yes." Colt answered quickly and honestly.

"Then you would be right! How many people are out there?" Giving him a look, he just smirked and pulled me with me.

"Not enough."

The doors opened and the instrumental music instantly got louder. Everything was covered in some type of flowers with string lights hanging from Penny's go to Mason Jar Chandelier, People stood on either side, blocking my view of Alec.

It was only when we reached the aisle, that I could see him. He was holding Adalynn would was playing with his tie. She was wearing a fluffy white dress but there was already stains on it from her crawling. She had taken off and is on the move. She was so close to walking that I got sad she was more of a toddler than a baby.

Alpha Carson was standing directly behind Alec. The soft breeze blew my hair over my face as we approached. Colt dropped my hand and went to take Adalynn from Alec. At first, Adalynn refused but once she saw Colt's tie, she found a new toy and started playing with it... well, she put it in her mouth and ruined it.

"You all may be seated." Alpha Carson announced. The music softened but didn't fully stop. "Alpha Alec and Luna Kristen have proven over and over again that they not only have each other's backs but will survive anything that is thrown at them. Since they have been together and official for quite some time now, we have decided to do an exchange of vows."

Alpha Carson stepped back and nodded to Alec. Alec took my hands as we faced eachother and started his vows.












###﻿Chapter 0614

"Kristen. From the moment I saw you at your tattoo shop, I knew we were destined to be together. You have proven to test every single ounce of patience I have, tested my ability to keep a level head, stretched my strength to sleep in the hosptial room, and finally rewarded me with the most amazing daughter. You are the strongest person I know, the most determined and the most frustrating all rolled into one. You are also the most inspirational luna I have ever met. I've learned from you, gotten stronger with you beside me and learned to be a better man. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way...well, maybe less hospital stays."

The crowd laughed at that. "You are truly the love of my life, someone I would lay my life on the line for, someone that giving me a family I have always dreamed of. Thank you for going on this crazy journey with me."

Tears were in my eyes by the time he stopped talking. I could feel the love come from him. It was so strong that it was almost causing me to choke. "Luna Kristen." Alpha Carson said, quietly.

"Alec. You have saved me from being kidnapped, tortured, drowned, burned...maybe stabbed. I'm not sure, I've lost track of how many time just picturing your face gave me the strength to fight back every time. My only goal in life is to be the best mate, mother and luna I could be. Before I met you, I was closed off and reserved. You forced me to do things I wasn't comfortable with but it made me a better person. I've learned more from you than I ever thought was possible. You have truly saw me at my worst and my best is yet to come. I love you more than anything... well, maybe not as much as Adalynn and this little baby boy."

The room erupted in chaos as I announced my pregnancy. It was still the early stages but far enough along to do a blood test. Funny enough, Penny was also expecting but this time, it was just one baby girl.

Alec pulled me in for a kiss before Alpha Carson could even tell him to do so. The sounds of their cheers drifted away and it became just Alec and I. That was, until felt a tug at the bottom of my dress. Pulling back, Adalynn was asking to be picked up.

"Come here, little one." Alec cooed as he bent over and picked her up.

"LET'S EAT!" Alpha Carson bellowed. Music started playing as we walked back down the aisle. Everyone was already at tables so we went straight to the food.

The only thing I got to chime in on was the food. Mexican food was what I craved. It hurt Penny's soul to just do a taco bar but it made my mouth water. Alec held a plate for Adalynn and I carried both of ours. After filling up our places, we headed to our table. We refused to have our own table so we were sitting with all the alphas and lunas. Since they were in line, we were currently the only ones there.

"Are we still meeting this evening?" I asked Alec. He was currently trying to feed Adalynn but she wasn't having it.

"That's the plan. We need to sign off on the territory change and accept those who wanted to move."

"This is so fucking delicious!" I groaned as soon as the enchilada touched my tongue.

"Hey now! Watch that language." Alec scolded.

"Do you want to see what else this mouth can do?" I said and tried to sound sexy but

I wasn't sure that came across with enchilada sauce running down my chin.noveldrama

"Oh, I already know but you can remind me later." Alec smirked.

We had to stop talking since Colt and Penny walked up with their plates. "Where are the kids?" I asked.

"With a nanny in Alec's room. You can put Adalynn there if you want."

My heart ached a little but we would have to eventually. "Who is it?"

"You know her, Miss Schroder. She was the preschool teacher until she retired last year. Since then, she has taken up odd babysitting jobs to keep busy." Penny shrugged.

"The door is also locked so they can't get out and no one can get in." Colt added.

I didn't respond but looked over at Alec. He was feeling weird about it too but no one pushed the subject. "HEY! Love the Mexican choice!" Emily was smiling as the rest of the gang sat down. This was my first time seeing and talking to Jace since everything happened. It wasn't completely his fault but I haven't exactly forgiving him.

"I'm sorry, Alpha." A warrior walked up to Alec and tapped on his shoulder. Once Alec looked back, he started talking again. "There is a guy here that claims he is family? He said he is your uncle?"

Alec's eyes went to me before meeting Colt's. Every single man at our table straightened their backs before standing up at the same time. "What's going on?" Emily asked.

"This isn't good." Echo whispered and shook her head.

The guys were a little ahead but I decided I was going to be part of this conversation. "Can you girls please watch Adalynn?"

"Of course!" Penny smiled at me and the others nodded quickly.

"Thanks!" Standing up, I had to hold up my dress and ran after the guys. They had walked quickly to the front of the packhouse but I missed the introductions....if there was any

"... here to crash. I promise." He looked like Marc. I could see the family resemblance. However, it was Alec's anger that surprised me.

"What are you doing here?" Alec said and crossed his fingers.

The man who I assumed was Maddox looked directly at me as I walked around the men and stood in front, next to Alec and Colt. "Yes, why are you here?"

"I assume this is your luna?" He glanced at Alec before smiling at me. Sticking his hand out, he introduced himself. "I am Maddox, Alec's uncle."












###﻿Chapter 0615

Out of the corner of my eyes, I could see our warriors shift in position. My wolf was so angry that I had to stop her from growling at him. However, I wasn't going to play nice. Giving him a fuck you smile, I took his hand making him think I was accepting it. Instead, I pulled him forward quickly and punched him straight in the nose. Blood splattered at the same time his men took a step forward but so did mine.

"You have a lot of balls to step food on my territory and think I would accept you." I said with venom in my voice. Alec wrapped his arms around me and pulled me back.

Maddox stood up but was smiling as he took a tissue from one of his men. "Nothing less than I deserve, I know."

"You deserve much more but unfortunately for you, I am being held back. Why are you here?"

"I wanted to offer my apologize. It has been my understanding that the Florida police department had some footage and since the fire didn't fully cover your tracks, they have been in contact with you."

"How do you know about that?" Colt asked, dangerously.

"I have my ways. As an apology and an olive branch, I made sure the investigation has now been complete and no foul play is expected."

My jaw dropped. The Florida police had call and said our fingerprints were found at a crime scene and asked if we had been down there. We had to say that we were down there earlier in the week but it had been days since then. They didn't completely buy our story but it wasn't enough to charge us with anything.

"How?" Colt asked?"

"Not for you to worry about. I just wanted to come here and meet Kristen before we continued on our journey." Maddox blew his nose one last time before he pocketed the tissue. Holding out his hand, he looked at Alec. "I'm sorry how things played out but I'm still family. Let me know if you need anything."

Alec was torn but decided this wasn't the time or the place to have that conversation. Taking his hand, they shook before Alec quickly let him go. After nodding at me and giving Colt, Jace and Lars a look, he turned around and walked towards his car. We waited until he was out of sight before we moved.noveldrama

"You have blood on your dress." Colt sighed.

"Completely worth it." Satisfied, we walked back towards the party. Adalynn was screaming and laughing at the girls were making funny faces at her.

"What did you do?" Penny screamed as she saw my dress.

"Took care of business." I said simply and sat down.

Penny covered her eyes. "Why can't you just act like a lady!"

"Because I'm not you." I was indifferent to her annoyance with me as I kept shoving my face full of food.

"Leave her alone." Colt whispered in her ear.

Most of the place had finished eating and the sun was started to hide behind the trees, signaling the lights to turn on. The music changed as the dance floor started filling up.

"Let's have that quick meeting so we can get back down here to party!" Lars put his napkin down.

"Sounds good." Alec looked down at my plate. I was just about finished but usually I go in for seconds. "Is that okay or do you need another round?"

"I'm okay." It wasn't that I was hungry but I wasn't done eating something that was so tasty.

"What do you think about putting Adalynn in with the triplets?" Alec asked in the mind link as we all got up and headed towards our office.

"I guess we are going to have to do it eventually. I'll probably never be ready but maybe it is time." Taking his hand, Adalynn was practically asleep on his shoulder.

He didn't answer me but headed to drop her off as I opened the office. The maps were already spread out over the desk, making it easy to look at what was being proposed. Taking a minute to myself, I looked over it.

Alec and I would keep a chunk of optimal territory for vacationing and for the views. Colt was doing the same and the rest was being split in half for Lars and Jace. We had enough land and since there was so many lives hanging in the balance, we didn't want to figure that headache out.

"What do you think?" Alec asked as he walked in and shut the door.

Looking up at him, he seemed in a decent mood so the hand off must have went okay. "Looks fine." Shrugging my shoulders, I wasn't sure what he expected me to say.

"Here is a list of who is going where." Jace handed out papers to each of us. Everyone was separated into each Alpha and who wanted to go where. Most were staying where their homes were and going under the new alpha but there was a handful that did want to transfer to Colt or us.

"Looks good. Where do we sign?" I asked, ready to get back to the party.

"Here." Lars put the papers down. "You sign the yellow, Alec is the blue and Colt is the Pink. Jace and I have already signed the agreement."

Alec looked over it one last time before signing where indicated. "Where is Hank and Carson?" Jace asked.

"They had to run after the ceremony. They each had events in their packs that they needed to get back to." Alec answered as he handed me the pin.

"Well damn." Jace sighed.

"He said this was a young man's party and they were ready for bed." Colt chuckled.

I handed Colt the pin to do his part. "I agree. Let's head back to party!" Lars smiled at us.

"I'll get this submitted first thing tomorrow." Alec muttered as he took the pin from Colt.

"Let's go!" They slapped hands and turned around to leave. Colt gave us a look before walking out behind them.

"Are you doing okay?" Alec grabbed my arm and pulled me against him.

"I am." I said after a moment. "I'm ready for some quiet."

"Love, nothing about our lives is quiet. We got another bundle coming that is not going to be quiet." Alec put his hand on my stomach. I could feel the baby flutter.

"As long as you are beside me, I'm ready for whatever life throws at us." Wrapping my arms around his neck, Alec bend over to kiss me hard on the lips. "Come on. Let's show them how good I can still move on the dance floor." I said after he finally let me go. Grabbing his hands, we walked out of our office and back to the party.

THE END
