When marine scientist Sophia Rodriguez captures a mythical dragon in the Arctic depths, she ignites an ancient war between realms. Thrown into the luminous undersea kingdom of Aquaria, she discovers she is the prophesied "Bridge" between humans and the dragon king Tharrosâ€”whose enemies now hunt them both. As political strife fractures Aquaria and the primordial Leviathan stirs from the abyss, Sophia must master her awakening hydrokinetic powers alongside Tharros, a brooding commander, and a rogue witch. But their forbidden magic awakens a darker force: an abyssal guardian that hungers to devour all life. Can they forge alliances before the ocean itself tears apart?
