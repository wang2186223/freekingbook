Brutally betrayed and rejected by her Alpha mate on her birthday, pregnant werewolf Isabelle Anderson flees to New York—only to lose her child in a suicide attempt. Rescued by Klinn Adams, a CEO hiding an eerie secret, she discovers he’s her second chance mate. But Klinn feels no emotions, his wolf silenced by a cruel defect. As their bond ignites sparks he can’t deny, deadly secrets emerge: her vengeful ex hunts her, rogue werewolves threaten their world, and a shadowy enemy stalks her in the human realm. Can a broken Luna heal an Alpha who doesn’t believe in love, before old sins destroy their last hope?
