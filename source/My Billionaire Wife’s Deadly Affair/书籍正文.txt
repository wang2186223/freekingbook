### chapter 1
Later, when she had it all—fame, fortune, power—she still married me, no matter the cost.
Everyone said I was the one man she could never let go of. The one she held like something sacred in her hands.
Until the night she started bringing home different men, one after another—dragging my name through the mud, turning me into the punchline of every party in high society.
And I? I just stayed in the study. Silent. Out of sight. Never once interrupting her games.
Then one night, something in her snapped. She shoved me up against the wall, kissed me like a storm, and whispered with a trembling voice,
"Aren't you even a little jealous?"
She had no idea.
My medical report said: terminal stomach cancer.
While she spiraled in her madness, I was quietly counting how many days I had left.
-------
On our third wedding anniversary, Emily Johnson walked through our front door with a boy named Ethan Miller.
He couldn't have been more than twenty. Clear eyes, charming grin, a little canine tooth when he smiled—exactly Emily's type.
In six months, he'd become her favorite.
Even my closest friend pulled me aside, his voice tight with concern:
"Lucas, this one's different. You should see how she looks at him..."
On the morning of my birthday, I threw up half a basin of blood in the bathroom.
The doctor handed me the test results with a flat tone:
"If you're lucky, you'll make it until the cherry blossoms bloom next year."
My fingers turned white around the paper.
It wasn't death that scared me. It was dying in pain—burned alive from the inside out by chemotherapy.
He mentioned an imported drug that might help. The price? Half a year's salary for a single dose.
That afternoon, I went to Johnson Group to find Emily.
I ran into Ethan outside her office.
He was dressed in a custom suit, perfectly groomed, handing out coffee like he owned the place. When he saw me, he let out a dramatic gasp and covered his mouth.
"Oh my God. So you're the husband Emily keeps hidden away? You look like a walking corpse."
I caught my reflection in the glass—messy hair, pale skin, an old sweater that hung off my shoulders.
He wasn't wrong. I looked awful.
I was dying.
A secretary quickly yanked him aside.
"Shut up! That's Mr. Thompson. He used to be the man on Wall Street."
She lowered her voice.
"Emily still keeps his college photo in her desk drawer."
Ethan's smirk faltered, but he quickly recovered.
"So what? I'm the one in her bed now."
Then he strolled into the break room like he'd just won a war, coffee cup in hand, leaning against the doorway with that smug little grin.
He set the cup in front of me, letting it splash onto the desk.
"Mr. Thompson, is Emily still in her meeting?"
He adjusted his cuffs, flashing the limited-edition watch she'd bought him.
"Last week, I caught a cold. She canceled a board meeting just to stay home and take care of me."
Sunlight poured through the windows, making me squint. He looked so young. Fresh suit, expensive tie clip—one of Emily's favorites.
The room went quiet. Interns glanced over and started whispering.
"I heard Ethan spent the night in Emily's office..."
I wiped the coffee spill slowly, deliberately.
Three months ago, at her birthday party, she'd introduced him as her new executive assistant—her arm looped tightly through his.
That's when I noticed it. A tiny mole near the corner of his eye.
Exactly like mine when I was twenty.
Ethan leaned in, his cologne thick in the air.
"Don't take it personally, Lucas. Emily said you're getting older. She just wants me to keep an eye on you."
Then, tapping the divorce papers between us with one finger:
"Just sign. This whole act? It's pathetic."
The glass door slammed open.
A secretary burst in, breathless.
"Mr. Thompson! Emily collapsed in the conference room!"
Ethan's face went pale.
I stood, knocking the coffee over—dark liquid spreading across his crisp white shirt.
"You know why she's kept you around this long?"
I loosened my tie as I walked past him.
"Because when you smile… you look like the one she could never have."
The hallway lights stretched our shadows along the floor.
I pulled out my phone, opened the message from the hospital, and deleted it.
The words late-stage gastric cancer blinked once…
Then disappeared for good.

### Chapter 2
The glass door of the conference room slammed open as Ethan Miller stumbled in, his bone-china cup crashing to the floor in sharp, splintering pieces.
Blood dripped from his palm, soaking into the beige carpet like a slap of color on a blank canvas.
Emily Johnson froze mid-signature.
She shoved the documents aside and stood, her heels crunching over scattered papers as she grabbed Ethan's wrist, crimson smearing across her fingers.
Her voice sliced through the silence, ice-cold. "Who did this?"
The crowd instinctively parted, revealing me at the back of the room.
The intern who'd tried to steady Ethan was visibly shaking. I didn't flinch—just met Emily's stare with a wry smile. "I pushed him. What? Worried about your little boyfriend?"
Ethan jerked his hand away, his voice oddly steady despite the red rim around his eyes. "Director Thompson's right. I had it coming. But I love Emily. Call me a homewrecker—I don't care."
Then he laughed. The kind that scraped against your nerves.
His blood-streaked hand reached for Emily's pinky, hooking around it with the entitlement of someone who thought he'd won.
"You said you'd protect me," he murmured.
And just like that, the frost in Emily's eyes thawed.
She pressed a handkerchief to his wound, her voice softer than I'd heard in years. "Come on. Let's get you to the infirmary."
When she looked at me again, it was like I was an old coat someone forgot to throw away.
"Fifty grand," I said, stepping in her path. "It's my birthday."
The air tightened. No one spoke.
Emily folded the bloodied handkerchief carefully, like it was cashmere instead of cotton, and let out a faint, amused laugh. "Fine."
Then she turned to Ethan, lifting his chin.
"But first, apologize to my Ethan."
There were still tear tracks on his cheeks, but a smug little grin curled at the corners of his mouth as he leaned into her, smearing blood all over her expensive designer blazer.
A sharp jolt ripped through my gut. I could feel sweat breaking out across my skin.
What a joke—doctors told me I had three months left, and she couldn't even give me three minutes.
I turned away. The shattered porcelain crunched under my heel like the sound of something breaking inside me.
I wondered—when chemo started and my hair was gone, would she still be standing by Ethan, laughing at how pathetic I looked?
By the time I made it home, I barely had the strength to crawl into bed.
Pain twisted in my stomach, cold sweat soaking through my clothes.
With shaking hands, I swallowed two sleeping pills and muttered to myself, "Sleep. Just sleep. It'll stop hurting when you sleep."
Somewhere between consciousness and the dark, I dreamed of the Emily from ten years ago.
Back then, she was broke—but she gave me everything.
I remembered one birthday in particular. We passed a fancy café, the kind with tall windows and white cakes that looked too pretty to eat.
Snow was falling in thick sheets.
I scooped a clump of it into my hands, smiling. "Hey, doesn't this look like cake?"
Emily suddenly threw her arms around me, burying her face in my shoulder so I wouldn't see her crying.
Three days later, she showed up outside my dorm with a $35 cake in her frostbitten hands.
I found out later she'd passed out three thousand flyers in a snowstorm to afford it. Her fingers were raw and swollen from the cold.
Tears stung my eyes when I saw them. "Emily... Your hands are meant for writing dissertations, not this."
"I don't care," she said, fierce and serious. "Lucas, you're the best man I know. You deserve every good thing."
That day, I cried while eating the entire cake.
I can't remember what it tasted like now.
But I do know I've never eaten a better one since.
The ring of my phone jolted me out of sleep.
Still half-dazed, I answered.
"Lucas?" It was Emily's voice.
"Em," I murmured, "it's snowing... I want cake."
She didn't get a chance to reply before I slipped back under again.
The next thing I knew, pain ripped through my stomach like a knife, dragging me wide awake in the middle of the night.

### Chapter 3
The lights were on when I walked in.
Emily Johnson was actually home, silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling window, a cigarette smoldering between her fingers.
Moonlight etched her profile in silver, and through the drifting smoke, her stare cut right through me.
I headed for the fridge.
She caught my wrist, her touch cold but voice impossibly soft. "You've lost weight."
I yanked away. "Emily, are you out of your damn mind?"
She looked down at her empty hand like it had betrayed her. The smile on her lips slowly froze over.
Then I saw it—
A cake on the dining table.
"Happy Birthday" written in soft frosting, already starting to melt.
So that call last night… hadn't been a dream.
I walked over, picked up the cake, and tossed it into the trash.
Something inside her snapped. She slammed me against the wall. "Lucas, what the hell is wrong with you? Are you playing with me?"
I laughed, chest burning. "Of course I am. You're still the same, Emily—pathetic enough to come running the second I snap my fingers."
Her eyes reddened. She dragged me to the bedroom like a woman possessed.
She bit down hard on my lip, the coppery taste of blood spreading in my mouth. Then she marked up my neck like she wanted to brand me.
I was shaking, not from fear, but from pain. Still, I heard the break in her voice: "Would it kill you to say one nice thing to me?"
Then her phone rang, sharp and shrill.
Ethan Miller's drunken voice poured out of the speaker. "Ms. Johnson... they're forcing me to drink—"
Emily's eyes locked on mine, feral. "Beg me," she whispered. "Beg me to stay."
A memory slammed into me—
That night.
Me, on my knees in the pouring rain, blood mixing with the storm.
Her, dry under an umbrella, telling the guards, "Throw him farther. He's filthy."
I grabbed her collar, words laced with venom. "You. Don't. Deserve. It."
She smiled—smiled—and said into the phone, "Be good. I'm on my way."
The door slammed shut.
Silence swallowed the room.
I slid my hand under the pillow, fingers brushing the diagnosis.
Stage four stomach cancer.
Three months left.
Perfect.
Maybe this time, the pain will finally end.
Sunlight had just begun to flood the apartment when my phone lit up with message after message.
Social media had exploded. Photos of Emily at last night's gala—fist clenched around some girl's collar, her designer makeup cracking under fury—were everywhere.
"Mr. Thompson!"
The second I opened the front door, a wave of reporters swarmed me.
Camera flashes hit like gunfire. A kid in thick glasses shoved a mic in my face.
"Sources say Ms. Johnson assaulted someone over Ethan Miller. As her husband—"
I lifted my arm to block the glare, my sleeve stained with lukewarm coffee from one overzealous journalist.
Two years into her jewelry empire, even Emily's scandals were tabloid gold.
"Move."
I shoved past them, dress shoes splashing through rain puddles.
The kid chased after me, sneakers slapping against wet pavement.
"People are saying you abandoned Ms. Johnson when she was broke—now you're clinging to her, refusing to sign the divorce—"
I stopped cold. He nearly crashed into me.
Snatching his press badge, I spotted a university meal card tucked inside—Ethan's campus.
Paint stains on his hoodie matched the acrylics from Ethan's studio.
"Ethan sent you?"
I let go. Watched him fumble like a guilty freshman.
"Tell your buddy this: Emily begged me to marry her."
A sudden warmth hit my collar. I looked down—blood.
One drop, then another, soaking through the fabric like red ink.
Silence fell. The kid squinted at me. "Faking illness now? What, a little nosebleed and—"
I wiped my mouth. My palm came away scarlet.
"Stage four bone cancer," I said flatly. "Want to see the paperwork?"
His jaw dropped. Earbuds slipped from his pocket—the same model Ethan always wore.
I turned toward the garage. Behind me, he muttered, "No way that's true..."
The garage was dark. The motion sensor hadn't worked in months.
I stood there for a long time, not moving.
Blood dripped from my nose onto the steering wheel, slow and steady, like red wine spilling over crystal.
Like it did at our wedding—
Before everything went to hell.


### Chapter 4  

The hashtag exploded.  

Videos of me being surrounded by reporters went viral online.  

Emily Johnson quickly posted on Twitter: "We will never divorce. Please stop harassing my husband."  

The post included our marriage certificate photo.  

That afternoon, the reporter who asked the question was fired.  

Comments flooded in:  

"What a disgusting man! If he didn't want to marry, he shouldn't have. Stop playing the victim."  

"I can't believe Ms. Johnson is defending him... I'm so jealous."  

"Heard he dumped Ms. Johnson for money before, and now married her for money again."  

"Typical hypocrite. Absolutely revolting!"  

Suddenly, a comment shot to the top: "Shut up! None of you know the truth!"  

Netizens immediately demanded answers.  

The story begins five years ago.  

Late that night, my mother suddenly had unstoppable nosebleeds.  

In the ER, the doctor looked grave: "Hereditary blood disease. Less than 30% survival rate."  

Worse, the disease was highly likely to be passed to the next generation.  

When Mom woke up, her first words were: "Break up with Emily."  

My knuckles turned white gripping the hospital bed rail. "She wouldn't care about—"  

"I know."  

Mom smiled weakly. "That girl's liked you since high school. Remember that heavy snow day? She waited at the alley entrance, stomping her feet to keep warm."  

The memory surfaced clearly.  

That winter was especially cold.  

Emily always shoved warm breakfast into my hands.  

Later I learned she often went to class hungry.  

"When her grandmother was hospitalized, I saw her running around alone."  

Mom sighed. "That child's suffered enough. Don't make her bear more."  

I bit my lip until blood filled my mouth.  

That night, I stayed on the hospital rooftop until dawn.  

At 4 AM, I texted Emily to end things.  

The phone screen burned my eyes.  

Tears blurred the keyboard as they fell.  

I stood outside the flower shop, staring blankly at the bright red persimmons displayed in the glass case.  

My late mother had loved these—she would buy a whole bag whenever she saw them.  

"Miss, would you like some persimmons?" the shop assistant asked, peeking out.  

I nodded and pulled out my phone to scan the payment code.  

As my fingers swiped across the screen, a sudden wave of dizziness hit me.  

These episodes had been happening more often lately.  

Clutching the heavy bag of persimmons, I hailed a taxi.  

Before getting in, I hesitated for a moment, then gave the driver the address of Johnson Group.  

The security guard in the lobby recognized me, his eyes flickering with surprise.  

I swiped my access card and took the elevator up, catching a glimpse of my pale reflection in the mirrored walls.  

When I pushed open the door to the CEO's office, Emily Johnson was staring at her phone screen.  

I recognized the video immediately—it was the one I'd recorded that morning, wiping blood from my nose as I whispered, "I'm dying."  

Her head jerked up, and the phone clattered onto the desk.  

We locked eyes, neither of us speaking.  

My gaze drifted past her to the corner of the desk.  

The faded fabric lucky charm doll that should have been there was gone.  

"Where's my doll?"  

My voice trembled.  

Emily's lashes fluttered.  

She turned and opened a drawer, pulling out an elegant velvet box.  

Inside lay the yellowed male doll.  

"I've kept it safe," she said softly. "I take it out every day."  

I reached for it, but she suddenly snapped the box shut.  

"Why come for it now?"  

Her eyes bore into mine. "Because of that video?"  

I turned away, looking out the window.  

The memory surfaced—ten years ago, my mother had bought these two dolls at the temple.  

The sunlight had been golden that day as she smiled and said they would protect me and Emily forever.  

"It was always mine," I rasped.  

Emily stood abruptly, the box falling to the floor.  

The doll rolled out, stopping at my feet.  

As I bent to pick it up, she dropped to her knees first, clutching the little figure tightly.  

"Ten years," she whispered, her eyes red-rimmed. "And now you finally come to see me?"  


### Chapter 5  

Ethan jogged after me, grinning when he heard me ask for the lucky charm doll. "The day before yesterday, I cut my hand while peeling fruit. Ms. Johnson was so worried about me. She said she couldn't stand seeing me hurt, so she gave me that doll."  

"She said its silly expression reminded her of me—clumsy but cute."  

"Lucas, don't you think she's blind? How could someone as handsome as me look like that ugly thing—"  

My fists clenched, nails digging into my palms.  

I glared at Emily. "Who said you could touch my things?"  

"My mother knelt for three days and nights to get that for me. What right did you have to give it away?"  

She smirked. "Oh, it was yours? My apologies. It looked so cheap, I thought it was some flea-market junk—"  

I grabbed her slender throat.  

Emily didn't flinch, meeting my gaze calmly.  

Ethan shoved me away. "Are you insane? Attacking someone over a stupid doll?"  

He stormed out but returned moments later, clutching my lucky charm.  

"Here!"  

He hurled it at me. "Who the hell wants this trash?"  

The ceramic doll shattered on the floor.  

I watched as the base—engraved with my birth details—split into pieces, like my broken life, impossible to put back together.  

Suddenly, breathing became difficult.  

I couldn't die yet. My mother was still waiting for me.  

I was afraid she'd linger on the other side, never moving on if I didn't come.  

"That was all I had left of her!"  

I punched Ethan in the face, my voice raw. "Of course it hurts! Damn right it hurts!"  

Tears spilled over.  

I seized Ethan's collar, but Emily stepped between us.  

I stared at her with bloodshot eyes and suddenly laughed. "I'm dying, and this is how you treat me. Emily… did you ever care about me at all?"  

She wiped the tears from my face. "First faking an illness, now this melodrama. Lucas, do you really find this amusing?"  

"Stop crying. Your tears—"  

A drop of blood splashed onto her hand.  

My nose gushed, worse than ever before.  

My legs gave out as agony tore through me, and I collapsed.  

"Call an ambulance! Now!"  

Emily dropped to her knees, cradling me as her white blouse soaked crimson.  

Her arms trembled, powerless as my life slipped away.  


### Chapter 6  

In a haze of semi-consciousness, Emily Johnson's sobs reached my ears in broken fragments.  

Her trembling fingers kept wiping the blood from the corner of my lips, her voice shattered. "How did this happen... He was fine just yesterday..."  

The sharp scent of disinfectant made my temples throb.  

The attending physician's voice came from behind the curtain. "The cancer has metastasized throughout his body. According to his prior wishes—"  

"Bullshit!"  

Emily suddenly overturned the medical cart, sending metal instruments clattering to the floor.  

She grabbed the doctor by the collar, her nails digging deep into her own palms. "I don't care about the cost—use the best drugs, the best equipment—"  

"Ms. Johnson."  

The doctor calmly pried her fingers loose. "This isn't about money."  

The hospital door slammed open.  

Sophia Williams strode in on stiletto heels, clutching a yellowed document.  

She didn't even glance at Emily before slamming the will onto the bedside table.  

"Read it."  

Her voice was ice-cold. "He signed a DNR three years ago."  

Emily staggered back two steps, her lips trembling as she reached for the papers.  

Sophia suddenly raised her hand and delivered a sharp slap across Emily's face.  

"Now you care?"  

Sophia's eyes were red-rimmed. "Where were you when he was in so much pain he couldn't sleep? Where were you when he sold his house just to pay for treatment?"  

The heart monitor suddenly blared an alarm.  

By the time the doctors rushed in, Sophia had already thrown herself beside the bed.  

She clutched my hand, her tears splashing onto my skin. "Lucas, listen to me—your mother is still waiting for you at the nursing home. You promised to celebrate her birthday next week..."  

I could hear my own weak heartbeat speeding up.  

Sophia pressed her forehead against my hand, choking on her words. "You always said... goodbyes should be meaningful..."  

Light pierced through the darkness.  

I struggled desperately, and in that blinding white glare, I finally saw Sophia's tear-streaked face.  

She froze for two seconds before laughing and crying at the same time, slamming the call button.  

"He's awake! He's awake!"  

I tried to speak, but no sound came out.  

Sophia fumbled, pressing my shoulders down. "Don't move, don't move—I'll get the doctor—"  

She turned and nearly tripped over the IV line, her tearful laughter almost comical.  

Emily stood in the shadows by the wall, her nails carving crescent-shaped marks into her palms.  


### Chapter 7  

In the days following my awakening, Sophia Williams became my shadow.  

Her care bordered on obsession—every meal had to be fed to me by her own hand, and she even insisted on helping me to the bathroom.  

One day, I caught her lingering outside the restroom, forcing me to quickly lock the door.  

Was this girl trying to turn me into a complete invalid?  

"Sophia, I'm craving dessert from the shop downstairs," I said, making up an excuse to send her away.  

The moment I confirmed she was gone, I threw off the covers and attempted to walk on my own.  

The doctor had said light activity would aid my recovery—I was sick of being treated like a fragile doll.  

My legs felt stronger than expected, and I hummed a tune in triumph as I made my way to the bathroom.  

But the moment I turned, my knees buckled without warning, sending me crashing hard into the sink.  

Warm liquid trickled down my forehead as I struggled to push myself up, accidentally yanking down the cloth covering the mirror.  

The grotesquely distorted face staring back at me sent a chill through my bones.  

"Lucas!"  

Emily Johnson burst in and wrapped her arms around me, pressing her palm tightly over my eyes. "Don't look... don't look at that..."  

Her voice trembled. "Where the hell is Sophia? Is this how she takes care of a patient?"  

I pried her fingers away. "Don't blame Sophia. I was the one who overestimated myself."  

Blood dripped from my chin onto my hospital gown. "She took extended leave for me—her parents are practically disowning her. And you? Where have you been all this time?"  

Emily fell silent.  

Fumbling, she grabbed tissues and pressed them to my wound, the pristine white instantly staining a shocking crimson.  

"Why didn't you tell me?"  

Her voice was hoarse. "You'd rather let an outsider see you like this than—"  

"What good would telling you do?"  

I turned my head, avoiding her shaking hands. "Last month, when the pain knocked me unconscious, I called you seventeen times. A nurse later told me you were at a bar celebrating Ethan's birthday."  

Emily froze.  

Of course she didn't know—that day, when I was rushed into the ER, I'd still been clutching a photo of us together.  

"You're cruel, Lucas."  

She suddenly laughed, but tears rolled down her cheeks in thick drops. "Yes, I'm a bastard. I'm blind. I deserve this. But can't you... can't you give me a chance to make it right?"  

I gazed out the window at the falling sycamore leaves, remembering that the day of my diagnosis had been bathed in the same golden twilight.  

Back then, I'd sat outside the doctor's office, scrolled through my contacts, and in the end, only called Sophia.  

"No need," I said softly. "Emily, what's left of my life is too short to survive another betrayal."  

### Chapter 8  


Emily Johnson would never know why I was so determined to leave her all those years ago.  

It was a drizzly evening when she returned, draped in glory, standing at my doorstep and declaring she would marry me.  

I stared at the exhaustion barely concealed beneath her flawless makeup, my throat tightening.  

The explanations I had buried in my heart for years were finally ready to be spoken.  

I had practiced them in front of the mirror countless times.  

I would tell her that every cruel word I'd said back then was a lie.  

I would make her understand that she deserved the best life—one without a marriage burdened by debt, a mother-in-law drowning in tears, or a husband who might collapse on the operating table at any moment.  

But fate loves a cruel joke.  

When I finally mustered the courage to find her, the clinking of glasses echoed through the phone.  

She drunkenly slurred out the address of a private club before hanging up.  

I stood in the rain, gripping my phone for a long time, then finally hailed a taxi.  

The club's hallway was a maze.  

I peered through glass-paneled doors until I saw her pinned to a couch, kissing a man.  

The chandelier's glare stung my eyes as I pushed inside.  

"Having fun?"  

My voice trembled.  

She swayed toward me, champagne breath hot on my face. "I only meant to tease you."  

Her manicured finger traced the third button of my shirt. "But seeing how miserable you are… I suddenly felt sorry for you."  

Laughter erupted around the private room.  

Then, in front of everyone, she announced, "Lucas Thompson, let's get married."  

She leaned in, her whisper sharp. "But don't expect me to love you."  

The words stabbed like a knife.  

I drew a slow breath. "I came here today to say—"  

Slap!  

The sound cracked through the room.  

Her eyes turned vicious. "Shut up! You and your mother are exactly the same!"  

She yanked my tie. "This isn't a discussion."  

As her crimson lips moved, I suddenly remembered her at seventeen, crouched in an alley feeding stray cats, her eyes bright as stars.  

"Oh," she laughed abruptly, "didn't Sophia Williams used to work at Nightfall?"  

Her icy fingers brushed my shaking hand. "What if her boyfriend found out—"  

I seized her wrist.  

She winced but grinned wider. "Can't handle it?"  

Her lips, smeared with lipstick, pressed close—metallic with blood. "Lucas, I can be so much worse."  

That night, I stood in the club's back alley, rain soaking me as neon lights flickered across her face.  

And I realized: some abysses, once fallen into, have no return.  

Our farce of a marriage lasted seven hundred and thirty days.  

Until one morning, she rubbed her temples, hungover, and said she wanted a fresh start.  

I simply handed her the divorce papers—already signed in my name.  


### Chapter 9  

I had bruised myself black and blue, but Sophia saw right through my lie at a glance.  

She trembled with anger, and for two whole days, no matter what I did, I couldn't escape her scolding.  

Finally, I hid under the covers, sobbing, "You only know how to yell at me... If you're so tough, take me to see my mom. Let's see if she doesn't tear into you."  

The room fell silent.  

Sophia gently lifted the blanket, her fingers threading through my hair. "When you're a little better, we'll go see her," she whispered, her voice so tender it shattered my heart.  

I knew it was a kind lie.  

I knew I wouldn't live to see that day.  

But I still nodded and smiled, pretending to believe in that promise.  

I started taking pills frantically, my arms covered in needle marks and bruises.  

Emily Johnson stood in the doorway, watching, before suddenly slamming the door shut.  

Late at night, their argument pierced through the hospital room.  

"He's like this, and you won't even grant him his last wish?"  

"Emily Johnson! Are you just waiting for him to die? So you can run off with that gigolo?"  

I stared at the ceiling, wishing for the first time that death would come sooner.  

I stopped mentioning my mother, but life was slipping away faster than ever.  

My moments of clarity grew fewer—it was time to say my goodbyes.  

Strangely, though the pain worsened, my mind had never been clearer.  

Ethan Miller finally couldn't hold back.  

He barged in when Emily was gone.  

Sophia snatched up the IV stand, ready to swing. "Get out!"  

But Ethan dropped to his knees beside my bed, tears streaming. "Lucas, please... Emily is pregnant with my child. Just... have mercy."  

Three months.  

All this time, while I was sick, they had been tangled up together.  

I should've known.  

To her, a dying man was nothing but a con.  

Ethan suddenly grabbed my arm, yanking so hard I nearly fell off the bed.  

Sophia lunged forward to shield me, but he shoved her back.  

With the last of my strength, I kicked him.  

Then came the sharp click of heels at the door—Emily's gaze was like a poisoned blade.  

"What did I tell you?"  

she asked, each word deliberate.  

Ethan's face paled.  

Sophia hurled a pillow at them. "Get out! Both of you, get out!"  

Her screams echoed through the room.  



### Chapter 10  

Emily Johnson dragged Ethan Miller away, her skirt brushing against my wheelchair.  

She said she'd come back to explain, her voice laced with a panic I'd never heard before.  

"Like I care," I muttered, fiddling with the IV tube, the plastic whispering between my fingers.  

Sophia Williams crouched down to meet my eye level, the scent of antiseptic mingling with her faint perfume. "Does your heart still hurt?"  

Her fingertip lightly tapped my chest.  

I suddenly grabbed her hand and pressed it against my left side. "There's a hole here. We should go shopping to fill it."  

She burst into laughter, tears still clinging to her lashes.  

I knew she'd been crying in secret lately—the nurses said she often returned with red-rimmed eyes while I slept.  

The mall's heating was cranked up high.  

I curled up in the passenger seat with a baked potato, deliberately dripping syrup onto her newly replaced cashmere seat cover.  

Sophia's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel, but she stayed silent.  

"Turn right," I said, pointing to the bridal shop with its glittering display.  

She was getting married in spring—I'd secretly peeked at the invitation designs.  

She slammed the brakes. "Lucas, you—"  

"I want to see," I cut her off. "Now."  

The clerk greeted us eagerly.  

I picked out a mermaid-style satin gown for Sophia and a tailcoat for myself.  

In the fitting room, we stood shoulder to shoulder before the mirror, the sequins on her dress digging into my skin.  

"Doesn't it look…"  

I lifted my phone, my throat tightening. "Like a brother sending his sister off to her wedding?"  

She punched my back—lightly.  

In the mirror, we were both smiling, something glistening at the corners of her eyes.  

I paid in the end.  

The thin receipt folded into a paper airplane, carried far by the wind when I tossed it out the window.  

The taxi stopped at the cemetery gates.  

I counted the steps to my mother's grave, snowflakes blurring her photo.  

"Mom," I brushed off the snow. "I might be coming to see you soon."  

The wind howled suddenly, like someone's sigh.  

[Extra: The Withered Succulent]  

Emily found the succulent when its soil had hardened into a crust.  

She watered it carefully, her fingers staining brown.  

It had been Lucas's treasure.  

She remembered how he'd fuss over these plants in the afternoon light, his frame so thin he seemed to dissolve into the glow.  

"Come back to life," she said to the empty living room, her voice shattering into echoes against the walls.  

Ethan's text came then.  

As the screen lit up, she almost saw Lucas looking up from the couch—the same expression he'd worn the last time she brought a man home.  

Surveillance footage from the private club spread like wildfire in their circle.  

In it, she slapped a woman, screaming hysterically, "My husband will be furious!"  

No one reminded her that the husband she spoke of was now just an organ donor agreement.  

Not until Ethan showed up with their old intimate photos.  

The stairwell fight played out like a silent film.  

When she fell, she spotted dried succulent leaves between the steps—just like the ones on Lucas's balcony.  

The psychiatric ward's curtains were always half-drawn.  

Emily clutched the tattered stuffed toy, her fingers tracing the hollow where its heart should've been.  

"There was a heart here," she told the nurse. "I lost it."  

Sometimes, she'd bolt upright in the dead of night and explain to the air, "I was getting my pregnancy test results that day."  

Then she'd absently touch her flat stomach.  

Moonlight spilled through the window, casting the dead succulent's shadow on the sill—a skeletal silhouette.
